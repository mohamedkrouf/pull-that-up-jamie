00:04:19.519 i didn't question you like i didn't
00:04:20.720 believe you you did 100 percent you said
00:04:23.120 it so casually that's what i said do you

00:04:26.800 antibiotics i said what happened i got
00:04:29.600 shot that's it usually
00:04:32.479 any of any of my other friends who've
00:04:34.720 been shot if i said hey man
00:04:37.759 what happened and they said i got shot
00:04:39.919 it didn't just end right there they
00:04:41.840 would say it's the craziest story ever
00:04:43.520 man yeah but you know
00:04:45.440 i'm away to the car and i had my little
00:04:47.759 dog right i was protecting her and
00:04:49.680 that's the story that i told but the
00:04:51.199 thing that you didn't believe me
00:04:53.280 if
00:04:54.160 someone said he got shot you can't say i
00:04:55.919 didn't believe you that's not true it
00:04:57.120 didn't look the look of your face is
00:04:58.720 like it's unusual the way you were
00:05:00.479 describing it i got shot and then you
00:05:02.400 wouldn't say anything more just like
00:05:03.680 what's yours black people don't
00:05:05.280 no what happened how'd you get shot well
00:05:07.199 you remember i had a disagreement with
00:05:08.840 so-and-so well we finally had an
00:05:10.800 opportunity our paths crossed we found a
00:05:13.280 situation where those energies came
00:05:15.039 together we was like how are we going to
00:05:16.800 settle this right
00:05:18.160 it wasn't like that i understood it
00:05:20.000 wasn't like that it was a okay and you
00:05:21.840 don't want to get specific about details
00:05:24.720 no i don't want to get specific i just
00:05:26.240 want you to respect the fact that i got
00:05:27.600 shot i believe that you got shot i do
00:05:29.520 respect it i'm sad that you got shot but
00:05:31.440 i'm glad you're okay i'm better i'm good
00:05:33.759 so
00:05:34.479 how is your thumb doing is it going to
00:05:36.320 be all right
00:05:37.440 yep
00:05:38.880 it's gonna be good
00:05:40.400 you know we got all the bullet fragments
00:05:42.160 out of it
00:05:43.199 you know we avoided the surgery so i'm
00:05:45.120 gonna be good just gotta get the range
00:05:46.400 of motion back oh that's real good they
00:05:48.160 didn't have to do any surgery and
00:05:49.199 tendons or anything like that nope i got
00:05:51.360 lucky i have a friend who cut his finger
00:05:53.360 on a window man and he never got his
00:05:55.039 fingers back again his fingers are like
00:05:56.960 this curled i know everybody knows a
00:05:59.120 [ __ ] like that and we've all
00:06:00.479 made fun of that [ __ ] we've made
00:06:02.639 fun of the person that you know that
00:06:03.840 don't have a thumb
00:06:05.440 but i'm telling you doing this after me
00:06:07.680 surviving this gunshot [ __ ] just butting
00:06:10.240 in my pants become a task that i took
00:06:12.400 advantage i took took for granted right
00:06:14.880 the point i'm making is that
00:06:16.720 you're lucky to have all of your limbs
00:06:18.960 all of your [ __ ] on your body yep
00:06:21.759 if you don't appreciate it until one
00:06:22.960 [ __ ] gone well i think that's
00:06:24.880 the case with everything right like we
00:06:27.199 didn't appreciate how good we had it
00:06:28.800 before the lockdown before kova came
00:06:31.039 around nobody appreciated how good we
00:06:32.560 really had it we was living in a moment
00:06:34.400 we were all so spoiled we were spoiled
00:06:36.240 by how good everything was
00:06:38.000 but we didn't think it was spoiled
00:06:39.600 because that was what was going on right
00:06:42.560 until [ __ ] shifted and then same thing
00:06:44.960 like you lose your thumb you're like oh
00:06:46.960 [ __ ]
00:06:47.840 you know i really do appreciate uh doing
00:06:50.720 those three spots that night
00:06:52.720 you know what i mean i appreciate the
00:06:54.240 fact that i could just walk with my
00:06:56.160 family anywhere and i wouldn't be judged
00:06:58.000 i wouldn't be discriminated against
00:06:59.360 whatever it'd just be like there goes
00:07:01.199 joe and his family not just like do you
00:07:02.800 have a mask or not right you know
00:07:05.919 but
00:07:06.639 i do believe that
00:07:08.240 it took
00:07:09.360 a pandemic
00:07:10.720 for people to really realize what the
00:07:13.120 most important things in life are
00:07:15.520 i think so for sure i think at the
00:07:17.039 beginning people were nicer because they
00:07:18.880 were scared and they were like it was
00:07:20.479 almost like post 9 11 feeling right like
00:07:22.479 we're all in this together right that
00:07:24.080 didn't last very long
00:07:26.080 it was unrealistic to think that
00:07:27.599 everybody's gonna be that way people
00:07:28.800 don't get frustrated once also resources
00:07:31.120 started getting low and people started
00:07:32.800 realizing they're not gonna be able to
00:07:34.080 work for a long [ __ ] time did you see
00:07:36.160 the the governor got busted did you see
00:07:37.599 the photos which governor governor
00:07:39.199 california he got busted for what got
00:07:41.039 busted going to a restaurant with 12
00:07:42.720 people no social distancing no masks all
00:07:45.120 the [ __ ] that he's been preaching for he
00:07:46.960 didn't do
00:07:47.919 they were saying that he was in outdoors
00:07:50.080 like
00:07:50.800 his people said it was outdoors but now
00:07:52.160 they have photos of it 100 percent
00:07:53.520 indoors right they're all endorsed but
00:07:55.039 the thing is
00:07:56.080 the unrealistic part about that you know
00:07:57.759 people got to
00:07:59.280 push their platform this match has has
00:08:01.520 been crazy but me i know it shouldn't be
00:08:03.680 like this and i know it's like but what
00:08:05.039 does that [ __ ] girls helping you but
00:08:06.639 what does it represent
00:08:08.400 when i see [ __ ]
00:08:11.120 like that
00:08:12.400 in a situation that no mass not socially
00:08:14.000 distant
00:08:15.039 i just assumed that they all been tested
00:08:17.599 and they all have been in a bubble
00:08:18.960 situation well that's because you've
00:08:20.400 been in a bunch of bubble situations
00:08:21.919 like right wait dave did the shows down
00:08:24.080 in yellow springs you bubbled me first i
00:08:26.479 bubble you here you're the first person
00:08:28.000 you're the first person you didn't rape
00:08:29.680 my nose you ra raped my finger
00:08:32.479 i didn't do it yes you did you hired a
00:08:34.080 nurse you made somebody do it
00:08:37.039 you could call it whatever the [ __ ] you
00:08:38.320 want to do but she worked for you that's
00:08:40.240 true and you forced that that she had to
00:08:42.640 do it well i just suggested it probably
00:08:44.480 a good idea for everybody yeah but they
00:08:46.399 but it was good for everybody and you
00:08:47.839 knew that so we know like that's a
00:08:49.120 bubble world yeah but it's not
00:08:50.560 surprising that you see the governor in
00:08:52.160 a situation like that because i'm pretty
00:08:54.320 sure it doesn't send out the right
00:08:56.320 message but i'm pretty sure
00:08:58.000 that the [ __ ] was tested well
00:08:59.680 that's what he should have said they
00:09:01.279 can't say that because they're a
00:09:02.399 politician and everybody go wait a
00:09:03.760 minute if i just test people can i go to
00:09:05.279 work
00:09:06.560 like what dave's doing with all his
00:09:07.760 shows yeah test people in the audience
00:09:09.680 and you can have a full audience you can
00:09:11.040 you know you have a bunch of people that
00:09:12.640 are healthy you know you you
00:09:15.200 you're taking the measures to create
00:09:17.279 that safety yes it's a bubble here's the
00:09:19.440 thing that a lot of people understand is
00:09:21.200 that like you could literally create
00:09:24.160 your own bubble yes like i know people
00:09:27.120 in certain states you have to meet a
00:09:29.440 certain requirement to be tested you
00:09:31.600 can't be attested unless you have she
00:09:33.680 starts showing symptoms but you can
00:09:35.360 create your bubble there's testing
00:09:37.360 almost everywhere there's an opportunity
00:09:39.600 for people to get tested it's a little
00:09:41.120 harder than that for most people because
00:09:42.880 but most people have been stupid
00:09:45.120 most people in terms of like just
00:09:47.040 peoples of just your access to it it's
00:09:49.920 not that common where you can go to a
00:09:51.440 place and get a quick test yet okay so
00:09:53.600 then what's the difference and i may be
00:09:54.800 wrong that this may be my ignorance like
00:09:57.120 california like i know the situation
00:09:59.839 like at dodger stadium you know i'm
00:10:01.839 saying like for the most part anybody
00:10:03.920 with i guess a california idea whatever
00:10:06.320 they can get tested no but hold on you
00:10:07.920 know that takes hours you know those
00:10:09.760 people have to wait in line for hours
00:10:11.200 there was a line to get it done yeah
00:10:13.600 yeah
00:10:14.399 there are students [ __ ] if you have a
00:10:16.320 job man if you have a job and you're
00:10:18.399 you're supposed to be at work at 9 00
00:10:19.760 a.m and you you get to the covet thing
00:10:21.600 at 7 30 and they tell you it's a two and
00:10:22.959 a half hour line that's what it is
00:10:24.640 that's the reality and most of those
00:10:26.480 aren't giving you the results
00:10:27.680 immediately not immediately but enough
00:10:29.680 where you could if you got those results
00:10:31.600 to say you get those results in 18 hours
00:10:33.519 say you were going to play in a family
00:10:34.720 function or something you don't do [ __ ]
00:10:36.000 like you could do what i'm saying is
00:10:37.760 like when the bubble the idea of the
00:10:39.600 bubble first started starting with the
00:10:40.880 nba you kind of contributed to that dave
00:10:42.959 did it well ufc did it first yeah they
00:10:44.959 did it and ufc did it first but he
00:10:46.880 always thought like oh my god
00:10:49.360 you don't have to be a millionaire to
00:10:51.440 create a safe bubble for you and your
00:10:53.519 family your friends right no you can do
00:10:55.279 it now easier than ever before but the
00:10:57.839 the problem with the governor saying is
00:10:59.440 other people will let us make a bubble
00:11:01.279 and go to work because that's what they
00:11:02.640 should do what they could do is what
00:11:04.560 we're doing here we're just lucky that
00:11:06.399 podcasting is an essential business i
00:11:08.640 think she's trying to jump down she's
00:11:10.320 not trying to kill herself no i mean
00:11:11.920 she's just looking over the edge she's
00:11:14.640 my emotional dog i understand all right
00:11:17.360 listen if anybody gonna jump it's gonna
00:11:19.200 be me i'm in tune with her okay she's
00:11:21.920 the most adorable little dog i've ever
00:11:23.440 seen i've never seen a little dog as a
00:11:25.279 puppy maggie river she's five months old

00:12:04.320 [ __ ] sad eyes fool you have you ever
00:12:06.000 seen a toy pitbull jamie i don't think
00:12:07.839 so they're really tiny we know real pit
00:12:10.240 bulls like the fighting pit bulls they
00:12:11.680 were like 30 pounds they weren't big
00:12:13.279 dogs the ones that they bred for
00:12:15.120 fighting
00:12:16.079 the smaller ones are the little little
00:12:18.079 demons i don't even know if i can
00:12:19.680 remember ever seeing a small pit bull
00:12:21.920 yeah
00:12:22.800 brian cowan used to have a small pitbull
00:12:24.880 it was a tiny one and it was ferocious
00:12:26.959 that's where he gets his personality
00:12:28.320 from it's not him no he bought animals
00:12:30.720 we went to a guy who raised them for
00:12:32.959 fighting oh [ __ ] yeah
00:12:35.360 we were like in our 20s
00:12:38.000 but oh my god look how tiny damn that
00:12:40.639 little [ __ ] looked tough as [ __ ]
00:12:42.240 the black one look at this the black
00:12:43.920 lives matter one side space
00:12:46.560 oh my god that's ridiculous that dog is
00:12:48.320 ridiculous see that's the thing that
00:12:50.079 they do they take these dogs but they
00:12:52.560 break their legs and [ __ ] like that
00:12:54.240 right well no they just breed them they
00:12:56.560 they
00:12:57.360 do what's called uh like they
00:13:00.480 they select right so like a dog with
00:13:02.880 shorter legs they'll breed with another
00:13:04.240 dog with shorter legs and they'll try to
00:13:05.839 select for certain traits like i used to
00:13:08.399 have a dog that was from hawaii and they
00:13:11.120 used him for hog hunting that's what
00:13:13.519 they use his family for so he had long
00:13:15.279 ears it was a dog specific
00:13:17.839 to hawaii yes yeah yeah they they they
00:13:20.880 breed a lot of pit bulls in hawaii and
00:13:22.480 one of their jobs because most dogs do
00:13:24.160 they go get birds what the [ __ ] does hog
00:13:26.000 hunting okay see what they do is in the
00:13:28.480 real thick brush you can't really get to
00:13:30.720 the hogs like it's hard to shoot them
00:13:32.560 you with a gun like you're shooting
00:13:33.920 through hundreds of yards of brush but
00:13:36.079 the dogs can go in there and get them
00:13:37.680 and they'll hold them to hold the pig
00:13:40.160 so there's a style of that makes the
00:13:41.920 hunting easy though right
00:13:44.320 it does
00:13:45.440 except for the dog it's not like the
00:13:48.000 same kind of hunting because you're
00:13:49.120 relying 100 on the dogs usually there's
00:13:51.519 two groups of dogs depending on what
00:13:53.199 animal you like if they they hunt
00:13:54.720 mountain lions these they'll use a
00:13:56.399 certain kind of dog that'll bathe the
00:13:58.160 dog right obey the mountain lion and but
00:14:00.160 if they hunt pigs a lot of times they'll
00:14:02.000 use an animal that lets you know where
00:14:03.519 the pig is and then they release other
00:14:06.000 animals that hold the pig so those are
00:14:08.079 the those are the pit bulls and then you
00:14:10.000 shoot them well they usually stab them
00:14:12.639 hand
00:14:13.519 like
00:14:14.240 up yeah it's kind of [ __ ] oh so that
00:14:16.399 experience is all about the dog
00:14:18.880 it's the dog
00:14:20.399 is the one who did it and you just
00:14:21.519 finished the job damn it's crazy too
00:14:24.160 there's
00:14:24.959 excuse me there's there's videos of it
00:14:26.720 of the way they do it it's like
00:14:29.040 and i've been asked to go on one of
00:14:30.480 those hunts i'm like i am not interested
00:14:32.079 in doing that
00:14:33.440 what happens when a dog gets old do they
00:14:35.600 like get new dogs but this is a this is
00:14:37.760 a thing that people are doing for two
00:14:39.760 reasons one for food right because this
00:14:41.920 is the best way that they can get food
00:14:44.399 like you can trap this animal and then
00:14:46.959 that's that's how you're gonna get the
00:14:48.079 animal if you just rely on just hunting
00:14:50.320 with like a rifle or a bow and arrow in
00:14:52.240 real thick [ __ ] with wild pigs you're
00:14:54.639 probably gonna go hungry so
00:14:56.720 so there's that and then the other thing
00:14:58.240 is these are invasive animals like
00:15:00.639 they're brought over to hawaii and
00:15:02.399 they're wild and they have no predators
00:15:03.920 so they have to kill them they have to
00:15:04.959 control them so did they bring them up
00:15:06.079 here to kill a species or something like
00:15:08.560 i know that no no they brought them over
00:15:10.240 for food oh okay like captain cook and
00:15:12.639 those dudes used to do that [ __ ] they
00:15:14.000 used to release ghosts i don't know cook
00:15:16.160 i know captain crunch
00:15:17.680 i know captain crunch yeah that's the
00:15:19.199 cat i don't know delicious stuff yeah um
00:15:21.519 captain hook was an old pirate right
00:15:24.320 wasn't he cook cook don't say hook hook
00:15:26.959 was a pirate too
00:15:30.240 yeah captain cook uh he used to go to
00:15:33.600 islands and they would drop off animals
00:15:36.079 so that the next time they came around
00:15:37.600 they'd have something to
00:15:38.839 eat yes they'd leave goats on an island
00:15:41.600 i think that's how the goats got on
00:15:43.120 galapagos i think that's how they got on
00:15:45.519 a lot of islands the these pirates or
00:15:48.000 sailors would drop these animals off but
00:15:49.920 meanwhile these animals destroy
00:15:51.440 ecosystems yeah but you had some fresh
00:15:53.440 goat when you have some fresh coat yeah
00:15:55.279 [ __ ] the rivers they had a lot of
00:15:56.560 turtles too they they killed off a lot
00:15:58.480 of sea turtles because they would take
00:15:59.759 sea turtles and they would flip them
00:16:01.040 over and put them on their back and
00:16:02.160 they'd be good for weeks
00:16:04.399 yep they would eat them because you
00:16:05.519 don't you don't need any they don't need
00:16:07.279 anything like they can survive just on
00:16:09.600 their back for weeks and weeks and weeks
00:16:12.079 and you don't have to worry about
00:16:13.120 refrigeration or them yeah but you can't
00:16:15.759 tell somebody you're hunting turtles
00:16:18.320 you're not trying to do that that's
00:16:20.160 slow as a [ __ ] if you're like i
00:16:22.560 [ __ ] stalked this [ __ ] and i followed
00:16:24.639 this turtle for three days
00:16:27.680 i think uh they probably get them on the
00:16:29.600 beach but if you got them in the water
00:16:30.800 they'd be quick
00:16:32.160 sea turtles when i was growing up
00:16:34.240 [ __ ] turtle on the road
00:16:36.560 and it was always one country
00:16:37.839 [ __ ] like this he usually was a
00:16:40.000 mechanic in the neighborhood
00:16:41.680 and he had like oil up under his hand he
00:16:43.519 always helped people's baby mothers with
00:16:45.519 [ __ ] changing their brake pads and
00:16:47.120 [ __ ]
00:16:48.399 just one of those grimy dirty
00:16:50.160 [ __ ] that eat any type of
00:16:52.480 roadkill and whenever we saw a [ __ ] a
00:16:55.440 dear dead turtle or something we knew
00:16:57.360 that [ __ ] was gonna be yelling out
00:16:58.399 turtle soup yeah people that's like
00:17:00.320 turtle soup yeah i'm not a big fan of it
00:17:02.560 but i've never had it yeah it seems like
00:17:05.119 it will probably be an alligator meaty
00:17:07.439 meaty type of family alligator tastes
00:17:09.199 good it is yeah everything tastes good
00:17:11.439 when it tastes like chicken that's the
00:17:12.640 reference for any thing it tastes like
00:17:14.799 chicken yeah i have frog legs recently
00:17:17.919 they were good
00:17:19.520 you it's i've had frog legs before
00:17:22.079 but trying to convince a black person to
00:17:23.760 eat frog wear legs is a
00:17:26.079 tough sale that's all order yeah
00:17:28.880 for to get a black person
00:17:31.360 to order frog legs off of a menu it's
00:17:34.320 like getting them to say
00:17:35.919 i want my steak
00:17:37.679 uh
00:17:38.480 rare
00:17:40.000 it's always got to be well done you eat
00:17:41.840 well done no that's what i'm saying i
00:17:43.919 don't know
00:17:44.960 but how do you eat your steak medium
00:17:47.440 medium yup
00:17:49.039 not medium rare
00:17:51.760 i don't
00:17:52.960 there's a lot of black people to watch
00:17:54.160 this [ __ ]
00:17:57.360 yeah they're gonna be like i'm gonna
00:17:58.559 tell you when he changed when they
00:18:00.400 started talking about blue and rare yeah
00:18:02.559 when they was like when they started
00:18:04.240 talking about blood that's when he lost
00:18:05.760 the streets right
00:18:07.679 that i could do medium medium rare i
00:18:10.320 can't do it i would i understand i've
00:18:12.240 had it like that but my preference would
00:18:13.600 be medium yeah but the average you know
00:18:16.320 circle that i grew up around my
00:18:17.919 jiu-jitsu instructor eats it well done
00:18:19.840 and when he orders it i cringe like
00:18:22.559 machado well done i go
00:18:25.039 do you know what that feeling is for the
00:18:27.520 imagine the chef that gets the order and
00:18:29.200 says
00:18:30.559 two well done steaks at table 49 they're
00:18:32.799 calling them every
00:18:34.160 [ __ ] racial thing that they can think
00:18:36.000 of
00:18:37.440 that's the quickest way to [ __ ] make
00:18:39.520 somebody order a [ __ ] well done steak
00:18:42.320 and chicken did not enjoy it not at all
00:18:44.240 did not like cooking it like that that's
00:18:46.080 a weird thing like a preference thing
00:18:47.520 like if you ask people's preference like
00:18:50.160 it's not like you just cook it like if
00:18:51.520 you order chicken they just cook your
00:18:52.799 chicken they don't ask you what
00:18:54.080 temperature you'd like your chicken
00:18:55.280 breast but they know yeah well they just
00:18:57.200 cook it right
00:18:58.720 but even pork chops same thing right
00:19:01.440 they don't ask you but with steak
00:19:02.960 they'll give you options well why the
00:19:04.320 [ __ ] are you giving me an option
00:19:06.080 if i can't have all done
00:19:08.240 you should just have it your way but
00:19:10.000 it's just insulting it is but it's
00:19:12.160 insulting like give the opportunity to
00:19:14.000 insult
00:19:15.120 because they do have that as an option
00:19:17.120 have you ever been uh a certain way like
00:19:20.320 judge somebody by the way they
00:19:22.320 ordered their
00:19:23.600 yeah i do honestly but but again john
00:19:26.240 jack machado like i said i have nothing
00:19:28.400 but respect for him it makes me sad that
00:19:30.400 he likes well done meat
00:19:32.960 i know this is going to be bad people
00:19:34.559 like what type of brother am i but i
00:19:36.080 took my sister to eat once she ordered a
00:19:38.400 steak and she ordered it well done i
00:19:40.400 said i think you should order something
00:19:41.840 else i said i'm not
00:19:43.039 paying for a leather belt
00:19:45.120 wow and i didn't have to eat this [ __ ] i
00:19:47.520 wasn't gonna do it i just felt [ __ ] up
00:19:49.600 when you felt judgy
00:19:51.360 i didn't feel i was judgy a little judgy
00:19:53.679 yep i was like let that [ __ ] hood
00:19:55.280 [ __ ] go is it but isn't that the only
00:19:57.440 food that we have that with like
00:19:58.720 cheeseburgers nobody gives a [ __ ] if
00:20:00.160 somebody says how do you want your
00:20:01.039 cheeseburger like well in the black well
00:20:03.440 done in the black community when you say
00:20:05.280 cheeseburger for the most part that's
00:20:07.120 going to be well done yeah black people
00:20:08.960 don't want to see the pink in it that's
00:20:10.240 right they want they'll tell you
00:20:13.039 all the pink out well you really should
00:20:15.039 with ground beef see the thing with
00:20:16.400 ground beef is
00:20:17.840 you don't know what the surface area is
00:20:19.840 when you're eating ground beef right
00:20:21.200 they take a cows whatever and they grind
00:20:24.559 it up the stuff in the middle like that
00:20:27.200 could have been on the outside right so
00:20:29.360 you don't know like when you get a steak
00:20:31.840 you sear the outside you cook the
00:20:33.919 outside
00:20:35.360 there's no room for bacteria anything
00:20:37.440 that could have grown on the outside is
00:20:38.799 dead and the inside you don't have to
00:20:40.159 worry about unless it's rotten that's
00:20:42.159 why black people get their [ __ ]
00:20:43.919 hamburgers well done well that's that's
00:20:46.000 wise
00:20:47.120 we didn't know it but that's just what
00:20:48.480 it was for hamburgers you don't want to
00:20:50.080 get food poisoning right yeah hamburgers
00:20:52.320 unless you are right there when they
00:20:55.039 grind it or you go to a top shelf
00:20:56.880 restaurant where they literally they'll
00:20:58.559 take a piece of chuck roast and they'll
00:21:00.159 grow or even flame and yawn like some of
00:21:02.159 them do it with like uh if you get a
00:21:03.520 burger that's ground out of philly young
00:21:05.520 you're in the right neighborhood you're
00:21:06.400 in the right neighborhood they usually
00:21:07.600 add fat to it believe it or not to make
00:21:09.679 it juicy yeah to make it juicier what is
00:21:11.600 it with white people with blood though i
00:21:13.600 don't know
00:21:14.480 i mean like
00:21:15.679 like
00:21:17.200 i know this white people get a kick out
00:21:19.120 of like
00:21:20.000 the rarest they can order their steak
00:21:21.600 like the blood part of it like yeah you
00:21:23.600 know what rare is weird when somebody
00:21:26.000 orders rare or you know what blue you

00:21:36.400 want [ __ ] to see the knife and
00:21:38.559 you do your picture joe it's it's like
00:21:41.360 you waited for the blood to sweat at a
00:21:43.919 certain temperature you know when it
00:21:45.200 looks the bloodiest and that's the shot
00:21:47.919 what i'm trying to do what i'm trying to
00:21:49.520 do is show that it's cooked perfectly

00:22:48.080 okay i said you can cook yeah and you're
00:22:50.080 it's not condescending it is but the way
00:22:52.240 with that the way you looked at me you
00:22:53.679 looked me up and down you judge me
00:22:56.640 that's the difference joe that's the
00:22:58.960 jiffers what i said i could cook elky
00:23:01.520 let me see what i've heard let me tell
00:23:02.880 you whatever i heard you cook really
00:23:04.240 well i heard you have amazing barbecue
00:23:06.559 skills
00:23:07.440 that could be quite borderline quite a
00:23:09.039 few people that could be borderline
00:23:10.240 racist
00:23:11.280 that could be borderline
00:23:14.159 you said barbecue you like i said
00:23:16.159 barbecue is one of the most complex
00:23:17.600 forms of cooking i know but you guys
00:23:19.600 are careful you're doing it slow too
00:23:21.280 much you [ __ ] it up too little you don't
00:23:23.360 do it right and then you it's hard to
00:23:24.640 put it back on because it hasn't been
00:23:26.320 sitting at the same temperature the
00:23:27.600 entire time that's the art of barbecuing
00:23:30.480 but when i hit barbecue i think about
00:23:31.919 the barbecue i understand like the black
00:23:33.520 barbecue i understand like the frankie
00:23:35.600 beverly and the whole thing it's a whole
00:23:36.960 production not just one piece of
00:23:38.640 barbecue that's what barbecue in texas
00:23:40.320 is mostly white people i think and i you
00:23:42.480 know
00:23:43.200 my own personal experiences i will say
00:23:44.960 this
00:23:45.760 white people can [ __ ] smoke some meat
00:23:48.000 they know how to do it here i'll tell
00:23:49.039 you that daddy when i first got i think
00:23:51.039 it's a place called blacks i don't know
00:23:52.480 if you found the favorite terry blacks
00:23:54.240 phenomenal didn't that that franchise
00:23:56.640 didn't they break up like yes they broke
00:23:58.960 up they used to be with the family and
00:24:00.640 then the the sons started on their own
00:24:03.120 started playing literally they had some
00:24:04.960 issues i don't want to air their dirty
00:24:07.120 laundry on the podcast right but uh the
00:24:09.520 science somebody stole it
00:24:11.360 something happened
00:24:13.120 something happened somebody gave up the
00:24:14.559 secret these pla people terry black's in
00:24:16.880 town has only been open since 2014 i
00:24:19.360 believe and it it feels like a place has
00:24:21.520 been around 100 years i mean they got it
00:24:23.679 dialed in
00:24:25.120 that barbecue's off the hook think about
00:24:27.919 it they have to have it dialed in if
00:24:30.400 if they came up generations and
00:24:32.000 generations yeah they're just putting
00:24:33.600 whatever the recipe is whatever the love
00:24:35.200 is i know they make their own they make
00:24:36.799 their own smokers they use giant propane
00:24:38.960 tanks and they make their own smokers
00:24:41.600 oh maybe that's what i enjoy next level
00:24:44.080 yeah white people level of barbecuing
00:24:45.840 when they start doing the machines and i
00:24:47.840 should say they hire someone to make
00:24:49.360 their smokers
00:24:50.640 but they get this dude to make the
00:24:52.240 smokers out of propane tanks they're not
00:24:54.640 buying like a big commercial smoker
00:24:56.640 they're having this commercial smoker
00:24:58.080 made they give us a game bro
00:25:00.720 they did an amazing job they wanted it
00:25:02.159 to their specifications and those those
00:25:04.240 uh propane tanks are thick as [ __ ] it's
00:25:06.799 heavy duty man where's the wood well you
00:25:09.200 cook with wood
00:25:10.799 the wood is an offset you know those
00:25:12.400 smokers work right so you have an office
00:25:14.320 a firebox the firebox is over on the
00:25:16.320 side and they're constantly checking the
00:25:18.480 temperature and opening the flues make
00:25:20.400 sure it's at a perfect temperature and
00:25:22.159 then you got the smoker which is off to
00:25:24.320 the side and they're moving meat around
00:25:26.320 because it's hotter where the air comes
00:25:27.679 right out but they've got the really
00:25:29.200 well ins oh my god they got it dialed in
00:25:31.360 their brisket is ridiculous it's so good
00:25:33.679 that's the what i'm talking about
00:25:35.600 that [ __ ] melts the amount and it's
00:25:37.679 don't come off bloody like that it's a
00:25:39.600 different kind of animal
00:25:41.039 that's that's that's elk i mean you
00:25:42.880 could have
00:25:43.919 elk and you could do it that way they
00:25:45.520 cook the neck meat that way my friend
00:25:47.120 john dudley wearing elk yeah
00:25:49.840 neck meat because the neck meat is very
00:25:51.760 strong and dense because elk has giant
00:25:54.400 antlers right so elk's carrot it's like
00:25:56.880 it's doing weights with it but elk
00:25:58.320 doesn't have no fatty it's no fat no fat
00:26:00.640 no fat no fat there's a little bit of
00:26:02.559 fat on the outside of them but there's
00:26:03.840 no fat in the meat at all it's a totally
00:26:05.679 different thing so you got to kick it
00:26:06.880 slow so if it's anything other than that
00:26:09.360 like medium rare like that it's gonna be
00:26:11.200 dried out right you want it just cooked
00:26:14.000 slowly and seared on the outside so like
00:26:16.640 i take a totally different approach if
00:26:18.159 i'm cooking like a rib eye from a cow
00:26:21.200 versus an elk steak completely different
00:26:23.440 way of cooking i know that because you
00:26:25.120 never post
00:26:26.480 regular steak pictures it's like i'm i
00:26:28.960 eat regular no you don't you don't never
00:26:30.559 you [ __ ] once you did your [ __ ]
00:26:32.559 first elk
00:26:34.080 your regular steak pictures was just
00:26:36.080 dead man well they're not as interesting
00:26:38.080 to me regular steak is great i'll cook
00:26:40.480 it i'll eat it
00:26:42.000 but
00:26:43.120 the elk is like i have an intimate
00:26:45.120 relationship with that everyone knows
00:26:46.960 that of course they do i mean
00:26:51.039 even when i tell people i'm gonna do
00:26:52.880 your show they'll like take a bite of
00:26:54.880 the elk for me
00:26:56.720 i'm serious man it's like yo you done
00:26:59.279 some cool [ __ ] they see you do a lot of
00:27:00.720 cool [ __ ] but they've never seen you and
00:27:02.480 you told me do i really want elk and i
00:27:04.000 was like yeah but
00:27:05.279 um if i had i was in the hospital
00:27:07.520 recovering from an injury so i couldn't
00:27:08.880 get here the way i wanted to that's a a
00:27:11.679 a lucky injury in the sense right like i
00:27:13.919 mean all the things that could have gone
00:27:15.120 wrong with your thumb not even need
00:27:17.039 surgery right able to get the bullet
00:27:18.559 fragments out i mean that's that's how i
00:27:20.399 run my life man i try to make it easier
00:27:21.919 as possible anybody else could have
00:27:23.520 [ __ ] had this injury and been [ __ ]
00:27:26.080 up if the pandemic can't stop me neither
00:27:28.399 can this [ __ ] thumb man yeah
00:27:30.720 how does it feel i know it's a crazy
00:27:32.000 question you get it all the time from
00:27:33.679 being from a place like you were saying
00:27:35.840 like what we took advantage of yeah and
00:27:37.679 one of the things we never took
00:27:38.799 advantage of stage time because we
00:27:40.240 always did it but not
00:27:42.080 having it accessible to you all the time
00:27:44.080 how does it feel here with not being
00:27:46.640 able to like you know what i'm getting
00:27:48.240 ready to go do like
00:27:49.679 [ __ ] three spots
00:27:51.360 and hammer some [ __ ] out real quick well
00:27:54.080 i haven't done that since march you know
00:27:56.320 since uh the store closed down there was
00:27:59.440 no comedy at all in l.a so it was right
00:28:02.399 it was a whole life shift
00:28:04.799 um the only time i did it on the road
00:28:06.720 was july
00:28:08.240 and in july
00:28:09.679 i did four shows of the houston improv i
00:28:11.679 had a great [ __ ] day just left here
00:28:13.200 man great place it was did you feel
00:28:15.760 i know this sounds crazy i know we're
00:28:17.360 gonna get through some mag [ __ ] mask
00:28:19.120 [ __ ] story whatever
00:28:20.880 but it's a club that had a certain
00:28:22.960 capacity now they got to trim it down to
00:28:24.799 meet whatever the mandated
00:28:26.960 but people were in there temperature
00:28:28.399 check they were in there yeah i know
00:28:30.320 this sounds crazy some people were mass
00:28:32.960 some people didn't have mass and i think
00:28:34.480 i'm not mistaken they sell a ticket as a
00:28:36.320 group
00:28:37.360 right i don't know if they're doing that
00:28:38.640 now but they're doing that a lot of
00:28:39.760 places and it's like
00:28:42.080 you feel good about it yeah you know but
00:28:44.080 then it's like
00:28:45.520 people take away from that feeling
00:28:47.279 because it's always somebody like
00:28:49.520 where's the mask where's the mask right
00:28:52.080 there there are people that are rightly
00:28:54.720 upset at people taking risks because
00:28:57.039 those people that do take risks could
00:28:58.640 then get sick and if they're
00:28:59.760 irresponsible enough to take a risk and
00:29:01.279 get sick they might be irresponsible
00:29:03.279 enough to go out and mingle with people
00:29:05.039 when they know they're sick but some
00:29:06.640 people like that some people are selfish
00:29:08.720 you know that right i know that yeah so
00:29:11.520 you have to be and then they could even
00:29:13.279 give it out when they don't know they
00:29:14.720 have it but be asymptomatic but then
00:29:19.679 at some point
00:29:20.960 don't you have to be selective about the
00:29:23.600 people that you and yeah gage don't you
00:29:26.480 have to be selective
00:29:27.840 on the chances this is my frustration
00:29:30.159 i'm not a mask or a non-masker like
00:29:32.480 people make the argument but what if i'm
00:29:34.320 in the what if i go to the grocery store
00:29:36.559 and i have my mask on and there's this
00:29:38.240 old lady that doesn't have her mask on
00:29:40.399 then i don't think you should go places
00:29:42.320 where
00:29:43.679 it could be people that
00:29:45.600 don't have their mask on shouldn't you
00:29:46.960 order online or something just don't get
00:29:48.640 in that lady's face and you're gonna be
00:29:50.159 fine it's it's man
00:29:52.080 i don't think you should tell some old
00:29:53.760 lady that she has to put a mask on i ran
00:29:55.520 into old lady at the grocery store she
00:29:56.880 didn't have a mask on i was like all
00:29:58.320 right
00:29:59.440 what are you going to do she's old man i
00:30:01.679 mean this lady she probably feels
00:30:03.200 terrible breathing through the mask
00:30:05.279 feels like she doesn't have much time to
00:30:06.720 have an asthma attack she had one on but
00:30:08.640 she was doing this [ __ ]
00:30:10.320 i got into the argument up yo
00:30:12.399 that chin
00:30:14.320 i get yelled at i went to a grocery
00:30:15.679 store i'm getting a couple of items
00:30:17.360 and i had my [ __ ] mess and joe

00:30:29.520 registers down every minute she had a
00:30:30.720 mask everything and my [ __ ] went right
00:30:33.520 to the tip of my nose she was like sir

00:30:59.200 your fingerprint time to switch to
00:31:00.559 android i don't have an android
00:31:03.200 i don't have it that's very evil for you
00:31:06.240 to end
00:31:07.360 another i know but i wouldn't talk about
00:31:09.279 your [ __ ] phone joe why is it evil
00:31:11.919 because it was the wrong time
00:31:13.410 [Laughter]
00:31:16.960 it was the [ __ ] wrong time
00:31:20.720 and the thing i was making so i had to
00:31:22.640 hide you guys
00:31:23.760 this is a sorry this is what i had to do
00:31:25.919 joe
00:31:26.799 i had to actually
00:31:28.559 stand
00:31:30.000 leave the register
00:31:31.760 go to where i could do outside yeah show
00:31:34.240 my face over my phone and i went to pay
00:31:37.200 and then when that happened
00:31:38.960 i could have been pissed but i couldn't
00:31:40.399 be like you know what
00:31:42.159 i'm just never gonna go to that store
00:31:43.360 again
00:31:45.360 well it's just a lady working though
00:31:46.799 just put the mask over your nose i'm not
00:31:49.039 gonna put myself in a situation where i
00:31:50.399 can get frustrated i didn't it was just
00:31:52.240 for us
00:31:53.440 is there interesting for apple pay
00:31:56.640 but you already arguing with her right
00:31:58.559 is that part of the problem i never said
00:32:00.480 i was arguing so she was already telling
00:32:02.240 you put your mask over your nose
00:32:04.320 so she was at a heightened state of
00:32:07.120 awareness frustration yeah but she also
00:32:10.480 i don't know it was maybe you know what
00:32:12.000 it was me
00:32:13.200 i didn't see that energy around anybody
00:32:14.640 else perfect time to use the black card
00:32:16.399 i'm not going to do it
00:32:18.720 it's not it's the nose card
00:32:20.880 she saw your nose and she's some people
00:32:22.720 are just like real sticklers for [ __ ]
00:32:24.559 you know bridget fedesy no
00:32:27.039 comic from l.a writer she told me she
00:32:29.279 was walking on one side of the street
00:32:30.880 there was a guy across the street on the
00:32:33.039 sidewalk on the other side yelled at her
00:32:35.120 put a mask on
00:32:36.880 let me tell you something this argument
00:32:38.399 i know it's for safety and everything i
00:32:40.000 know it's for safety and what the lies
00:32:42.240 we share and all that but for some
00:32:44.000 people it's a perfect opportunity to be
00:32:46.559 an [ __ ] exactly it's like and that's
00:32:48.960 the like the fine line is like do you
00:32:51.120 really care about this mass or you get
00:32:52.559 to either it's discrimination against
00:32:55.279 mass people
00:32:56.640 and no no mass people it's just people
00:32:58.799 have an opportunity to tell people what
00:33:00.080 to do they get mad they do yeah they're
00:33:01.919 like you want to hear to it then they
00:33:03.279 get mad because you're not listening to
00:33:04.480 the rules [ __ ] it right well that's why
00:33:06.320 people are particularly upset at this
00:33:07.679 gavin newsom [ __ ] because he's been the
00:33:09.840 one telling us you can't have large
00:33:11.600 gatherings for thanksgiving stay home
00:33:13.760 social distance wear a mask in between
00:33:16.399 bites of food right this guy's been
00:33:18.320 saying all this [ __ ] and then he's doing
00:33:19.679 now you go see him eating at a
00:33:21.120 restaurant so does that mean do we
00:33:22.799 believe everything's what you got
00:33:24.640 so that's a perfect example of you know
00:33:27.200 a lot of things are uh motivated through
00:33:29.519 politics and looks
00:33:31.039 you know i'm saying everything you see
00:33:32.320 not what it's not really
00:33:34.080 what you think it is so how much
00:33:36.399 uh
00:33:37.279 how much are you going to put into a
00:33:38.799 person
00:33:39.760 like what their thoughts
00:33:41.840 yeah
00:33:43.039 not much
00:33:44.480 what kind of person wants to do that
00:33:45.919 that's the problem what kind of person
00:33:47.360 wants to be a governor
00:33:49.120 they're not normal and you didn't care
00:33:51.679 until the pandemic when the pandemic
00:33:53.679 rolled around you realize oh the mayor
00:33:55.679 matters

00:34:20.000 person who's got the solution there's

00:35:52.079 brain of steel that's a lot he he knows
00:35:54.800 how to force himself to do [ __ ] that
00:35:56.880 hurts
00:35:57.760 that's what he was saying
00:35:59.200 he said and then whatever it is he one

00:37:01.599 and impr and the type of person and type
00:37:03.680 of human type of father you are that's
00:37:05.359 why people like kim are so important
00:37:06.720 because he'll tell you what people like
00:37:08.560 him are so important because he'll tell
00:37:10.320 you he used to have no discipline right
00:37:12.880 so like look at him now this is not
00:37:14.480 something he was really i gotta
00:37:16.320 interrupt it's afraid he said this is
00:37:17.920 because i was having coffee with dave
00:37:19.280 today and then he said that about you
00:37:22.400 because i was talking about uh i can't
00:37:24.560 drink no [ __ ] with my antibiotics when i
00:37:26.400 got shot and everything and then
00:37:28.079 sometimes wait we talked about you and
00:37:30.000 then and that's what he said he said i
00:37:31.920 [ __ ] love and respect his discipline
00:37:34.480 i do have some of that yeah but i'm lazy
00:37:36.960 too man i force myself in all the stuff
00:37:38.960 that i do yeah but you get challenged by
00:37:40.800 something though something kicks you in
00:37:42.160 the ass yeah well i don't
00:37:44.640 i don't like falling
00:37:46.800 i don't like
00:37:48.880 not doing what i'm supposed to do so i
00:37:50.720 forced myself to do what i'm supposed to
00:37:51.920 do but it's never easy it's not easy you
00:37:54.079 know it's like i always would think of
00:37:56.240 disciplined people as being like uh
00:37:58.480 there was no wavering they just got up
00:38:01.280 and did it but that's the other thing

00:40:37.200 larry got his own lotion and i was like
00:40:40.480 [ __ ] that [ __ ] then i met with this
00:40:42.880 young lady and she's like a chemist when
00:40:45.119 it comes to this lotion [ __ ] and we
00:40:46.880 started working on it and then when i

00:41:01.599 website
00:41:02.640 donald rawlings that's where you can get
00:41:03.920 it
00:41:04.640 okay
00:41:10.480 this is one thing that came out of this
00:41:12.800 not just for me joe for a lot of people
00:41:15.359 think about this a person that makes
00:41:18.240 their money on the road a road a real
00:41:20.800 road coming this happened to me
00:41:23.280 95 percent of the money that i make is
00:41:25.200 on the road
00:41:26.560 95 of the shows i had
00:41:29.440 are done
00:41:30.720 so only thing i have from what i usually
00:41:32.960 make is that five percent and i didn't
00:41:34.800 enough for [ __ ] right and even though
00:41:36.720 you could have some money stacked up or
00:41:38.000 whatever you still gotta you gotta ask
00:41:40.079 yourself what the [ __ ] is gonna be the
00:41:41.520 pivot i don't think the pivot's gonna
00:41:43.200 come for a long time either in terms of
00:41:45.119 us being able to get back to work no no
00:41:46.960 no we about to go next summer next
00:41:49.280 summer you think
00:41:50.560 joe
00:41:51.599 donnell
00:41:53.359 i'm not trying to say i don't believe in
00:41:54.640 corona right now but we
00:41:57.280 are on the track
00:41:59.200 of
00:42:00.240 not just deadness [ __ ] but being able to
00:42:02.400 have it under control we're about to get
00:42:04.400 to the point where people are going to
00:42:06.079 uh have more social security you know
00:42:08.640 what i'm saying just think about think
00:42:10.400 about the progress we made in a year
00:42:12.000 from when this [ __ ] first happened you
00:42:13.920 take a corona test you had to wait like
00:42:15.680 seven days right think about it when we
00:42:17.680 first went first hit we had like oh my
00:42:19.760 god it was so scary so scary and then
00:42:21.839 all these ventilators ventilates
00:42:23.040 ventilators but if you know now since
00:42:24.560 when the pandemic started yeah we still
00:42:26.160 losing people but you don't hear that
00:42:27.920 ventilator talk too much no more well
00:42:29.599 ventilators are actually a bad idea now
00:42:31.280 they realize my point you know what i'm
00:42:32.560 saying i figured out a lot
00:42:34.880 i did a whole podcast yesterday on covid
00:42:37.040 with uh nicholas christakis from yale
00:42:39.520 cover [ __ ] he believes that
00:42:42.319 is a real problem yeah for sure you
00:42:44.079 don't i believe it but i believe it's
00:42:45.359 controlled controllable it is
00:42:47.560 controllable um i think there's it's a
00:42:50.359 multi-faceted problem and i think we're
00:42:52.400 only handling one aspect of it which is
00:42:54.880 keep people from working keep people
00:42:56.800 home keep people away from people no you
00:42:58.640 can't do you're treating people like
00:43:00.000 their children you got this is what you
00:43:01.520 got to do you got to let them go outside
00:43:02.880 that's what you got to do
00:43:04.319 we're going to have more creative ways
00:43:06.079 to make money like yeah think about the
00:43:07.680 comedy scene when we thought like the
00:43:09.760 only place to tell jokes was on the
00:43:11.760 stage
00:43:12.480 and i was i had some resentment towards
00:43:14.800 some of those
00:43:15.920 outdoor events the parking lot [ __ ]
00:43:17.760 first time i saw one of those parking
00:43:19.680 lot shows with horns i was like never
00:43:21.760 give a heckler an instrument to [ __ ]
00:43:23.760 your show
00:43:26.000 like there's no way i'm gonna these
00:43:27.680 [ __ ] don't like me there's no
00:43:29.040 way i'm gonna be
00:43:31.520 yeah but people are happy to be out man
00:43:33.440 it's a different experience that's
00:43:35.680 and then the point i always make is like
00:43:39.040 you you could suppress people you can
00:43:41.040 call them down for a certain amount of
00:43:42.319 time period time but after a while
00:43:44.160 you're gonna have to figure something
00:43:44.960 out my point i was gonna make something
00:43:46.640 they're only looking at one side of it
00:43:48.079 they're not looking at telling people
00:43:49.359 how to be healthy there's no talk about
00:43:51.280 that [ __ ] yes [ __ ] that's what's up
00:43:54.240 right son
00:43:55.920 you're a strong [ __ ] all your
00:43:58.079 [ __ ] are strong jamie might be the
00:43:59.760 least strong out of everybody excuse me
00:44:01.520 stop just saying like
00:44:04.160 man jamie i'm not saying you not strong
00:44:06.839 son i know that's what you just said

00:44:19.680 runs like jamie's in shape that's black
00:44:22.160 shape that's possible that's black
00:44:23.359 people's shape he does pull ups that's
00:44:25.280 black people shape run play basketball
00:44:27.119 and pull ups and push ups you do like
00:44:29.359 the jail work outside jamie's actually
00:44:31.119 in good shape i know i believe i'm sorry
00:44:32.960 james i didn't mean to offend you i get
00:44:34.480 it he's back
00:44:47.920 dude it's impressive like rain man [ __ ]
00:44:50.720 no no no you can't dunk working on that
00:44:52.560 [ __ ]
00:44:53.280 he's hitting three-pointer after
00:44:54.640 three-pointer like rain man there's
00:44:56.160 something weird about him
00:44:57.599 like he's got like he might he might
00:44:59.119 have a wire crossed in his brain i
00:45:00.960 didn't know you was nice what i'm saying
00:45:02.640 is
00:45:03.359 to go back to your point joe
00:45:05.599 is everybody's talking about the end of
00:45:08.000 corona
00:45:09.119 like don lemon man
00:45:11.040 don lemon man

00:45:20.880 [ __ ] years yeah four years and i was
00:45:24.319 like man if donald trump wins his
00:45:25.839 election don lemon is gonna jump off the
00:45:28.800 cnn building do you remember all their
00:45:30.480 faces when he won last time when they
00:45:32.319 won in 2016 they were all so depressed
00:45:34.800 yeah tapper and all those people on tv
00:45:37.119 just like [ __ ] i can't believe
00:45:39.280 this yeah but here's the thing joe i'm
00:45:41.359 like
00:45:42.800 i don't think you're supposed to do that
00:45:44.000 if you're doing the news you're doing
00:45:46.240 commentary you can do that i think if
00:45:48.160 you're doing the news you're supposed to
00:45:49.280 say the news joe let us figure it out
00:45:51.440 joe donald joe
00:45:53.760 that's why i do subscribe to notion that
00:45:56.400 fake news like to be honest it's all
00:45:58.480 fake
00:45:59.599 it's
00:46:00.480 all of them are fake
00:46:02.560 it's all fake and this is what i did
00:46:04.640 what i keep on telling people is like
00:46:06.800 how i know you're upset but when you're
00:46:09.839 like you you're
00:46:12.720 it's all personal
00:46:14.800 like everything history to the heart
00:46:16.800 like well that's where it gets weird
00:46:18.560 those two guys chris cuomo and don lemon
00:46:21.359 both of them they do this editorializing
00:46:24.640 and this like it's it's almost like
00:46:26.720 they're doing a podcast and their
00:46:28.000 opinion is all in it and their opinions
00:46:29.760 in it but it's also it's on the other
00:46:31.280 side too but it's scripted yeah and
00:46:33.839 they're doing it on a news channel
00:46:35.680 there's a lot going on there but that's
00:46:37.599 why if you don't here's another thing
00:46:39.760 about the media if you didn't understand
00:46:41.040 whatever party you agree with whatever
00:46:43.040 that if you don't understand
00:46:46.720 how
00:46:47.599 easy it is to manipulate the media joke
00:46:50.720 it is so
00:46:52.079 so simple to manipulate the media to
00:46:55.599 manipulate the media and the people to
00:46:56.880 listen to it well that's what manipulate
00:46:58.880 people what do you mean by manipulate
00:47:01.040 the media but like you could create
00:47:03.440 stories
00:47:04.720 you could create stories you could make
00:47:06.480 things happen
00:47:08.160 i got shot [ __ ] i see i got shot my
00:47:11.200 [ __ ] thumb that's what i heard
00:47:12.960 and a lot of people
00:47:14.319 don't believe me well i believe you
00:47:16.640 i don't believe that you believe me
00:47:18.090 [Laughter]
00:47:19.680 that's what i believe [ __ ]
00:47:21.760 that's not convincing but the point i'm
00:47:23.359 making is
00:47:24.640 like when i got when i first got shot
00:47:26.480 joe
00:47:27.680 i posted on instagram i didn't want to
00:47:29.520 post an instagram because i know that i
00:47:31.280 didn't want to get no war in the streets
00:47:33.040 going on people like going out looking
00:47:34.559 for the person who shot me my thumb so i
00:47:36.559 kept it to myself it didn't really bring
00:47:38.400 it to me people's attention i posted one
00:47:40.000 picture of me in the hospital
00:47:41.280 everybody's like you okay you okay
00:47:43.839 they don't know how what i got shot for
00:47:46.559 but they're just they instantly got
00:47:48.319 connected to that story did you ever
00:47:50.079 think of not posting it
00:47:54.559 i did
00:47:56.079 what made you decide to post it
00:47:58.720 the world needs to know the world need
00:48:00.400 to know some of the gigs i had to
00:48:01.920 postpone when i was
00:48:03.280 locker shot up not locked up and you
00:48:05.520 know what i'm saying it's like yeah i
00:48:06.880 wasn't ready to share to the world then
00:48:08.880 i didn't know how my friends were going
00:48:10.079 to take it okay then i wanted to be
00:48:11.920 transparent to be honest i let them know
00:48:13.200 i got shot that's what i did
00:48:15.440 you know
00:48:17.359 i see you feel like you still don't
00:48:19.520 believe me i do believe you
00:48:21.200 i think you're just looking for a very
00:48:22.640 specific reaction from me
00:48:24.720 i gave that up a long time ago
00:48:26.960 i gave up i was like whatever that was
00:48:28.559 what made me nervous the first time i
00:48:30.000 came up like what the [ __ ] do i say say
00:48:32.319 what you say [ __ ] don't try to all
00:48:34.800 right i'm here you are here but
00:48:38.400 are you thinking about bailing out la
00:48:39.839 yet
00:48:41.200 um i think so yeah a lot of people are
00:48:44.480 the reason
00:48:46.640 that we've started feeling um
00:48:52.079 when we don't
00:48:53.440 well you don't really need hollywood
00:48:55.119 like that
00:48:56.319 you know i don't think anybody needs it
00:48:57.839 anymore some people thought they did
00:48:59.599 you're right some people thought they
00:49:00.720 did they thought it was like you had to
00:49:01.920 be here every night i thought i needed
00:49:03.440 to be there for a long time and then
00:49:05.200 once
00:49:06.079 what happened this situation
00:49:08.000 then you realize oh what can i do you
00:49:09.920 like wait a minute
00:49:11.760 i really can make my own community yes i
00:49:15.040 can make my own community not only that
00:49:17.119 you get connected to all the other
00:49:18.640 communities like and all the other
00:49:20.800 podcasts we all help each other we're
00:49:22.960 all together i will say one with one
00:49:24.880 thing white people do
00:49:26.559 when it comes to podcast they support
00:49:28.079 each other yeah we support each other
00:49:29.760 but you know what man that's a new thing
00:49:31.680 because in radio it was the opposite
00:49:33.280 when they had radio they'd attack each
00:49:34.800 other like i remember opium anthony was
00:49:36.240 always at war with howard stern and you
00:49:38.160 know jay leno was always at war with uh
00:49:40.640 all the other late-night talk show hosts
00:49:42.640 and but did you think that that made
00:49:43.839 people engaged do you think that made
00:49:45.359 people engage with their platforms no no
00:49:47.359 no they were just they were just scared
00:49:49.520 because they only had a like
00:49:51.359 back in the day when you were on
00:49:52.559 television or the radio you had a very
00:49:54.240 specific time slot you had 6 a.m day
00:49:56.640 party to 10 a.m right
00:49:58.480 and other people are also
00:50:00.319 on at 6 00 a.m to 10 a.m and no one's
00:50:02.160 recording anything so you have to listen
00:50:03.920 to it live
00:50:05.280 television i was a part of that i don't
00:50:06.800 know if you i was a part of when hot 97
00:50:10.480 was the biggest in urban radio new york
00:50:12.240 was the biggest and then i was i was
00:50:14.160 doing radio when
00:50:15.520 power 105 came and became a competitor
00:50:18.160 they had no competition at first
00:50:20.800 you know it was just them then they got
00:50:22.559 challenged and that would that's what
00:50:24.480 made for interesting
00:50:26.480 interesting [ __ ] between both of them is
00:50:28.319 like yeah we talk [ __ ] about
00:50:30.800 97.1 97.5 then 105 then you start
00:50:34.160 listening to both of them to see what
00:50:35.680 [ __ ] they're talking you could do that
00:50:37.760 if you're them or you could listen and
00:50:40.559 if you'd like it tell people it's good
00:50:42.319 that's what podcasters do like if i'm
00:50:44.319 listening to your show i'll tell people
00:50:46.000 donald rawlings shows hilarious or
00:50:48.000 listen to this guy or listen to her
00:50:49.680 listen to what i'll tell people people i
00:50:51.839 don't even [ __ ] know man i tell
00:50:53.599 people about podcasts that i listen to
00:50:55.839 from npr or uh [ __ ] radio lab what i
00:50:59.760 always tell people because i'm
00:51:01.280 interested in cool [ __ ] i wanna know
00:51:03.359 about cool [ __ ] and if i find cool [ __ ]
00:51:05.520 i wanna tell other people about cool
00:51:06.839 [ __ ] that's cool but they they're
00:51:08.960 worried about if they talk about
00:51:11.040 something else it's going to take
00:51:12.079 opinions it's going to take attention
00:51:13.520 away from them that's what's called
00:51:15.359 famine thinking you can never
00:51:17.440 famine famine famine feast or famine i'm
00:51:20.160 a feast thinker i always think there's
00:51:21.920 enough for everybody everybody come
00:51:23.359 aboard i want everybody to be happy i
00:51:25.520 want everybody to make money i want
00:51:27.040 everybody to be famous i want everybody
00:51:28.720 to be happy i want them to be fulfilled
00:51:31.440 i don't want to be the man that that
00:51:34.400 idea of being the man is to me is
00:51:35.920 ridiculous that's your idea but on the
00:51:37.599 outside when you do stuff like that for
00:51:39.520 some people in their perception of you
00:51:41.440 that's what makes
00:51:42.880 you demand that's what makes you if you
00:51:45.040 able to inspire and motivate that's what
00:51:47.040 makes you demand that you know you say
00:51:48.400 you know well i'm happy if that's the
00:51:50.480 case that people think that way but i
00:51:52.480 know it i'm in a position to be generous
00:51:54.400 so they know it they even hold it
00:51:55.839 against you too it feels good to be
00:51:57.520 generous but they hold it against me who
00:51:59.200 hears it against me people that don't
00:52:00.559 like me they hold it against you that i
00:52:02.559 have that i have you on no people that
00:52:04.800 don't like me they'll say they hold it
00:52:06.079 against me because you did like you oh
00:52:08.319 because like there is a podcast
00:52:13.680 jamie
00:52:15.440 jamie is that what he talked about no
00:52:18.240 what are you talking about no they'll
00:52:19.599 tell you don't like you don't know you
00:52:21.680 yeah but like some people
00:52:24.160 they told me they wasn't going to like
00:52:25.520 you anymore because you liked me good
00:52:27.839 luck if that's what they said you are
00:52:29.680 they said they wasn't going to like you
00:52:30.880 because you didn't but that's ridiculous
00:52:32.400 anybody who thinks like that is out of
00:52:33.599 their [ __ ] mind they was like normal
00:52:34.960 they were saying [ __ ] like this and i
00:52:36.000 don't read the comments joe they were
00:52:37.760 saying [ __ ] like this
00:52:39.440 this [ __ ] like well joe was right up to
00:52:41.359 this point
00:52:44.079 yo they like you had a track record like
00:52:46.160 yeah i believed everything said until he
00:52:48.160 got loudmouth up there here's the thing
00:52:50.000 i don't think anybody will ever
00:52:51.520 understand the camaraderie that we all
00:52:53.200 have right comics have
00:52:55.280 it's a different world but the podcast
00:52:57.040 world is totally different y'all
00:52:58.000 [ __ ] yo y'all [ __ ]
00:53:00.079 it's just like
00:53:01.280 but man the podcast world is so [ __ ]
00:53:04.720 dope and the podcast world was ready for
00:53:07.200 the pandemic yeah the podcast people was
00:53:09.599 like this what pandemic i get to spend
00:53:11.760 more time with my kids i get more time
00:53:13.440 with my kids
00:53:14.400 and you get to spend more time doing
00:53:15.839 podcasts because everybody's free even
00:53:18.079 if you have to do those stupid zoom
00:53:19.440 podcasts you're still spending more time
00:53:21.040 doing podcasts yeah but it's like
00:53:24.160 you figured out like they knew it was
00:53:25.680 going to happen before it [ __ ]
00:53:26.880 happened i came in write it to her i
00:53:29.200 think i came in right at the right time
00:53:31.760 i don't think they knew it was going to
00:53:33.040 happen before it happened but i think
00:53:34.960 they got lucky
00:53:36.480 they got lucky that they were look man
00:53:38.400 back when i was uh just dependent upon
00:53:40.559 hollywood and giggs i'd be [ __ ] right
00:53:42.559 now i'd have no income coming in but you
00:53:45.119 saw the future too son you tried i said
00:53:47.920 this to you before
00:53:49.440 like when you hear like joe roger you
00:53:50.960 hear about this spotify deal and you
00:53:52.400 hear about all this type of [ __ ] blah
00:53:53.760 blah blah blah blah
00:53:55.440 and then you what
00:53:57.119 you don't understand like i said joe
00:53:58.880 everybody wants to be you right now but
00:54:00.720 nobody wants to be you when people were
00:54:03.200 saying no and equipment was breaking
00:54:04.880 down and we didn't know if we was going
00:54:06.079 to do it
00:54:07.440 you know thing is i never i didn't think
00:54:09.280 about it that way i didn't think like i
00:54:10.880 know this is going to blow up i thought
00:54:12.800 i like doing this i'm going to keep
00:54:14.319 doing it so you just continue to have
00:54:15.920 fun i just do what i like right
00:54:18.160 all the [ __ ] that i do if you think
00:54:19.599 about it i just do what i like whether
00:54:21.520 it's stand-up comedy or whether it's ufc
00:54:23.760 commentary or whether it's doing a
00:54:25.119 podcast i do what i like i do what i
00:54:27.440 like i don't think oh if i do this it's
00:54:29.839 going to be huge i just do what i like
00:54:31.760 that's the most empowering thing that is
00:54:34.240 so hard that's the most empowering thing
00:54:36.319 that is so hard for people to feel
00:54:38.799 comfortable enough to do it it's what
00:54:40.559 they're like because the tournament
00:54:42.319 turning into well this [ __ ] says
00:54:43.920 [ __ ] [ __ ] all the time you know what
00:54:45.200 i'm saying they haven't figured out a
00:54:46.319 way to get a w-9 or anything for it you
00:54:48.799 know get they get nervous about the
00:54:50.720 future too you gotta you gotta have
00:54:52.559 enough confidence in yourself to take
00:54:54.559 chances do you think
00:54:58.559 that
00:55:00.160 there are a lot of [ __ ] out here
00:55:01.760 there's a lot of posters is our country
00:55:03.359 [ __ ] our country has a lot of [ __ ] in
00:55:05.760 it because it's too easy to get by and
00:55:08.880 it's human nature to become soft when
00:55:11.839 when things are easy and when you're in
00:55:14.000 any sign of any kind of struggle
00:55:15.839 whatsoever that's when the real [ __ ]
00:55:17.520 emerge because they can't
00:55:24.960 because they fall apart
00:55:26.559 any adversity at all anything but this
00:55:29.040 is beyond that now because it's not
00:55:31.280 beyond that now joe the reason was be on
00:55:33.200 that this is the thing that this is
00:55:34.960 a personality trait or just as a side of
00:55:38.000 not to say that um i'm a fan of donald
00:55:40.640 trump or anything but it was certain
00:55:42.640 things that i could understand where the
00:55:44.480 thought comes from but how you
00:55:45.680 articulate to people is all [ __ ] up
00:55:47.599 the way he articulated to people
00:55:49.440 is it's like certainly terrible certain
00:55:51.359 people need filters certain people need
00:55:53.119 like kanye west needs interpreter you
00:55:55.359 know what he needed he needed a coach
00:55:56.799 because someone coached him for that
00:55:58.079 second biden debate right if you watch
00:55:59.920 that second biden debate he was calm and
00:56:02.400 cool let biden work himself up and
00:56:04.319 stammer and lie about [ __ ]
00:56:06.400 and he treat he had still attacked him
00:56:08.400 but he attacked him in a different way
00:56:09.760 the first time he did it he was
00:56:10.960 obnoxious he kept talking over him he
00:56:13.200 didn't let him talk he was ridiculous
00:56:15.440 everybody wanted to shut his mic off but
00:56:17.440 then someone must have coached him for
00:56:19.040 this or he realized himself man i'm
00:56:20.960 gonna take a different approach i'm
00:56:22.240 gonna tell you something the difference
00:56:23.520 i'm gonna tell you something different
00:56:25.839 whatever numbers you say the loser of
00:56:28.160 this election still won
00:56:30.400 breaking the record
00:56:31.680 i know he's not crazy second place still
00:56:33.359 was
00:56:34.079 second place would be first place
00:56:36.160 any other time in history it would have
00:56:37.839 [ __ ] on everything that's nuts it
00:56:39.680 shows everybody realize it's important
00:56:41.520 to find when you when you realize that a
00:56:42.880 guy like donald trump can become
00:56:44.160 president you realize oh my god it's
00:56:45.680 actually important to vote
00:56:47.440 yo bro
00:56:48.799 you know it has to until you see those
00:56:51.280 numbers yo it was like
00:56:54.079 it was crazy it was like
00:56:56.960 certain places separated by five
00:56:59.119 thousand votes i know ten thousand votes
00:57:01.680 yeah it's tight
00:57:03.280 and you could say you could make
00:57:04.319 anything you can make an argument you
00:57:05.760 could it went either way here's a
00:57:07.280 situation man
00:57:10.000 donald trump
00:57:13.599 let it
00:57:14.640 be known
00:57:16.000 that
00:57:18.079 he didn't give a [ __ ] about anybody but
00:57:21.280 his base
00:57:22.880 yeah pretty much that's it and i'm not
00:57:25.440 saying if it's a numbers game understand
00:57:28.559 that like there's a certain amount of
00:57:30.000 people to help you will help you get
00:57:31.359 elected
00:57:32.640 there's a certain amount of people
00:57:34.000 that's why you have strategists and [ __ ]
00:57:35.520 they'll be like if we do this we get
00:57:37.520 these robocalls here and everything you
00:57:39.359 know it's a science to that there's
00:57:40.960 certain people that can help you get
00:57:42.319 there
00:57:43.599 well if he
00:57:45.839 but he never made no like if he softened
00:57:48.160 his approach up i think the base would
00:57:50.720 not have appreciated it the numbers it's
00:57:53.280 like love him or hate him it's very
00:57:55.200 polarized and for to hate him works for
00:57:57.119 right for a situation whereas biden i
00:57:58.960 don't think people love biden something
00:58:00.960 has to be i don't think they dislike it
00:58:02.880 but they hate trump the people that
00:58:04.960 voted for biden hate trump
00:58:07.280 most of them or just feel like we just
00:58:08.960 can't do this anymore that's the people
00:58:10.880 that vote voted for biden hate trump but
00:58:13.440 they're not excited about him the way
00:58:15.119 they're excited about obama or excited
00:58:16.960 about clinton or excited about a million
00:58:20.160 other presidents in the past not a
00:58:21.839 million yeah but for the most part every
00:58:23.520 time it switches over it's because
00:58:24.880 somebody goes totally opposite of what
00:58:26.559 was going on
00:58:27.760 yeah there's a little bit of that but
00:58:29.359 it's it's usually [ __ ] you know it's
00:58:31.359 [ __ ] man but i'm like man these old
00:58:34.160 stories these old stories that they're
00:58:35.680 repeating over and over again biden is
00:58:37.280 filling up his cabinet with all these
00:58:39.119 billionaire uh hedge fund people's uh
00:58:42.559 like
00:58:43.440 not hedge fund people do you think by
00:58:44.960 the environment like the the guy that is
00:58:47.280 involved in an environmental he just
00:58:49.680 just hired some guy the people were
00:58:51.440 upset about i don't know what color is i
00:58:53.839 was reading about the important
00:58:55.440 environmental advisor that's important
00:58:57.520 to me because he that's important work
00:58:59.760 for a [ __ ] oil company the black part
00:59:01.599 is important to me an environmental
00:59:03.839 advisor was taking money from fossil
00:59:06.079 fuel companies they're like hey hey hey
00:59:07.599 hey hey hey hey this guy has ties to
00:59:10.480 fossil fuels and you're doing something
00:59:12.640 with him that involves the environment
00:59:14.319 there could be a conflict of interest
00:59:15.599 that's what i'm saying yeah if he's a
00:59:17.040 black guy okay yeah i could find that
00:59:19.760 we'll find out right now i bet they
00:59:21.599 probably
00:59:22.319 listen this is i i think they're
00:59:23.920 probably going to hire a lot of
00:59:24.960 republicans that's what they did they
00:59:26.480 already started black guys they're gonna
00:59:28.000 they're gonna hire a lot of people that
00:59:29.440 want to uh listen and in their defense
00:59:32.559 they probably think some radical uh
00:59:35.119 things need to be done to kick start the
00:59:37.119 the economy right now
00:59:39.599 i agree but i don't know how they're
00:59:41.040 gonna be able to work together
00:59:42.880 i think they're all dirty bro they all
00:59:44.240 work together here he goes uh biden just
00:59:46.640 appointed his climax
00:59:48.559 man yes told you son it's a fossil fuel
00:59:51.599 industry ally
00:59:53.359 black yeah there he is black look at
00:59:56.000 black as [ __ ]
00:59:58.000 that's all i need joe there you go he uh
01:00:00.960 raked in big money from fossil fuel
01:00:03.599 industry while waiting to help oil and
01:00:06.079 gas come or voting rather to help oil
01:00:08.400 and gas companies look how he's greeting
01:00:10.240 him is different look he's it's like
01:00:11.920 knuckles hey fella my [ __ ]
01:00:13.920 there's a video of um
01:00:16.319 lindsey graham and uh kamala harris fist
01:00:19.040 bumping each other it's adorable
01:00:21.119 commoner reaching across the aisle that
01:00:23.359 that was a good move he's walking by
01:00:24.960 fist bumps well she's the only good move
01:00:26.880 she's strong you know she was a district
01:00:29.359 attorney she got some questionable
01:00:30.720 arrests on her
01:00:32.000 there's some [ __ ] that she did
01:00:33.280 imprisoning people and keeping them in
01:00:35.280 prison to use them as to fight wildfires
01:00:37.839 and [ __ ] but i uh in my community i've
01:00:41.119 heard people talk about her and
01:00:42.160 everything like wonder what she
01:00:44.319 uh you you have trust in her you believe
01:00:46.240 in her
01:00:47.440 what i did believe in was when she got
01:00:50.880 elected to be the first
01:00:52.799 female vice president first black like
01:00:55.440 president within a couple of days the
01:00:57.920 commercials i've seen on different urban
01:01:00.160 platforms or just period it's been you
01:01:02.799 see a little black girl
01:01:04.400 right looking up to something mm-hmm you
01:01:06.640 know we see that shadow with her
01:01:08.480 standing there and little black girls in
01:01:09.760 the shadow black girls in shadow but the
01:01:11.760 little girls are just showing it's like
01:01:13.440 this
01:01:14.720 they feel yeah they feel black girl joy
01:01:16.799 they see something
01:01:18.559 that's she also you know she didn't i
01:01:20.799 know she put me just but she didn't do
01:01:22.720 just bad things she did a lot of good
01:01:24.640 things she she prosecuted a lot of child
01:01:27.119 sex predators a lot of pieces of [ __ ] a
01:01:29.280 lot of bad people she wasn't just
01:01:32.480 situations where people should have been
01:01:34.079 let out of jail weren't but there's also
01:01:36.079 like
01:01:36.880 this is the thing that we have to
01:01:37.760 realize when it comes to district
01:01:38.880 attorneys and just attorneys and
01:01:40.160 prosecutors and defense attorneys in
01:01:41.680 general they're trying to win a game and
01:01:43.359 it gets dirty when i tell you what
01:01:44.960 they're trying to process people
01:01:46.880 you haven't yet but you i'm sure you
01:01:48.240 will sorry but when someone you're
01:01:49.440 trying to drive a few people or defend
01:01:51.280 people the people defend people they
01:01:53.520 know are [ __ ] guilty and they'll keep
01:01:55.920 [ __ ] from the prosecution even though
01:01:58.559 they know they're defending a guilty
01:02:00.160 person they do it all the time so people
01:02:01.920 prosecute people that they're not sure
01:02:04.400 are guilty and they'll pretend they're
01:02:06.480 sure that that person's guilty because
01:02:07.920 they want to win and they'll withhold
01:02:09.680 information that could potentially
01:02:11.760 exonerate that person because they're
01:02:13.599 playing a game when you let people play
01:02:15.520 a game anytime you let people play game
01:02:17.280 and someone's trying to win they cheat
01:02:19.520 they try to figure out a way to do
01:02:20.960 better than you with with influence by
01:02:24.480 withholding things by holding things
01:02:26.079 back they know this judge they're tight
01:02:27.920 with this lawyer right they try to win a
01:02:29.920 game you've made it a game so you got a
01:02:31.920 prosecutor and you got a defense
01:02:33.200 attorney so you got two competing forces
01:02:35.119 you're always going to have lies 100
01:02:37.760 because people play games so that was
01:02:40.160 the business she's in her saying
01:02:43.599 business
01:02:44.880 that's her business that's her business
01:02:46.799 and they are a business of words like
01:02:48.960 you're saying there's no first there's
01:02:50.400 some laws how do i win particularly laws
01:02:53.920 but laws are the word how do i win with
01:02:55.760 these words right here right no matter
01:02:57.359 what you think how do i win with this
01:02:59.520 come on kamala you know that's not right
01:03:01.839 we're not talking about right
01:03:03.599 we're talking about what we could prove
01:03:05.599 and that's what lord's all about right
01:03:07.520 well that is if you are a defense
01:03:09.760 attorney that's your job is to protect
01:03:11.680 somebody um and try to get them off even
01:03:14.079 if they might be guilty and if you're a
01:03:15.599 prosecutor your job is to prosecute
01:03:17.359 somebody you're not your job is not to
01:03:18.720 go hey we might be wrong your job is not
01:03:20.640 to go hey let's look but the shady [ __ ]
01:03:23.599 is when you don't play by the rules and
01:03:25.200 you withhold information or uh or
01:03:28.000 withhold evidence and people have done
01:03:30.000 that in the past and that's when things
01:03:31.599 get real squirrelly because like okay
01:03:32.880 now you're not playing the game you're
01:03:35.039 using your unfair advantage but
01:03:36.640 nothing's surprising
01:03:38.640 no no it doesn't surprise me but what
01:03:40.319 i'm saying is it doesn't make a person
01:03:41.440 all bad right she's not all bad like
01:03:43.440 she's done a lot of very good things and
01:03:45.039 i read an article about all the
01:03:46.880 different things she did including the
01:03:48.799 different things that she did that a lot
01:03:50.160 of people thought were bad like
01:03:52.640 moms threatening moms with uh they would
01:03:55.039 go to jail if their son was truant but
01:03:57.680 it turns out no one ever went to jail it
01:03:59.359 was a threat and obviously it's
01:04:00.880 terrifying to be a single mom and think
01:04:02.400 you might get put in jail because your
01:04:03.680 son is just running around and doesn't
01:04:05.760 show up at school because you work two
01:04:07.200 jobs trying to put food on the table but
01:04:08.960 nobody ever actually did get arrested
01:04:10.960 and got wanted yeah because it's gonna
01:04:12.240 be too hard to prove that [ __ ] man and
01:04:13.760 some people and in some cases some
01:04:15.760 people
01:04:16.559 aren't i don't know if this was case
01:04:18.319 some people are too lazy in certain
01:04:19.599 situations too well i'm saying it's it's
01:04:21.920 not a good idea to threaten a mother
01:04:24.160 because she's a single mom trying to get
01:04:26.160 by and her son is not going to school
01:04:27.839 it's not good to threaten her with jail
01:04:29.119 time but sometimes people stop to make
01:04:31.760 decisions yeah sometimes people make
01:04:33.520 decisions like drastic decisions like
01:04:35.280 that
01:04:36.079 and maybe at the time they had a
01:04:38.000 perspective that's different than the
01:04:39.200 perspective that they have now it's
01:04:40.720 called evolution i want everybody to
01:04:43.039 have look i want them to have a clean
01:04:45.280 slate biden harrison in there now i
01:04:47.760 think clean slate forget about but let's
01:04:50.160 see what's going to see what they can do
01:04:51.680 the best thing to see the people they
01:04:52.799 put into office all the the cabinet
01:04:54.960 let's give them a chance we want them to
01:04:56.480 do well this is what was so [ __ ] up
01:04:58.400 about trump being in office so many
01:05:00.240 people wanted him to do well exactly so
01:05:02.240 many people hated him they really would
01:05:04.000 rather the country do bad under him
01:05:06.799 because if the country was killing it
01:05:08.160 unto him he's like look it's killing it
01:05:09.920 i'm the best i told you that everybody's
01:05:11.760 like [ __ ] right at least
01:05:14.480 maybe please even trump supporters go
01:05:17.359 into this one with a different attitude
01:05:19.280 let's let's all together say we want the
01:05:22.559 best for america what's it what's done
01:05:25.200 is done the election's over maybe you
01:05:27.119 were a tulsi gabbard fan like myself
01:05:28.960 maybe you like bernie sanders like
01:05:30.640 myself but maybe you like [ __ ] gosh
01:05:34.319 i love yang gang i love andrew yang he's
01:05:36.400 a he's an awesome guy i love a lot of
01:05:38.319 his ideas
01:05:39.839 but for now
01:05:41.520 we know where it is it's biden and
01:05:43.440 harris let's go but some [ __ ] man
01:05:46.319 [ __ ] trump trump trump or you got
01:05:47.760 different level trumpers well there's a
01:05:49.119 lot of people that think they're so mad
01:05:50.960 as a [ __ ] that don't want to
01:05:52.160 hear [ __ ] son part of the problem is
01:05:54.160 he's telling them that it's a rigged
01:05:55.760 election he's telling him that's what's
01:05:57.280 so effective
01:05:58.799 but part of the problem is all elections
01:06:01.920 have some corruption they just [ __ ]
01:06:04.799 do they've been around for that enough
01:06:06.400 for you to say [ __ ] when you leaving
01:06:07.839 [ __ ] i don't think there's did he keep
01:06:10.640 his secrets and [ __ ] joe well
01:06:13.119 mike baker who used to be in the cia was
01:06:15.280 on mike baker are you a baker
01:06:17.359 his name is mike baker
01:06:18.960 he was in the cia and he came on the
01:06:21.039 podcast recently he was telling me that
01:06:23.039 even if they did
01:06:24.480 overturn it even if they did rather uh
01:06:27.359 like find corruption the amount of votes
01:06:30.079 you're talking about in most these
01:06:31.520 states it's not enough it's not enough
01:06:33.119 not nearly enough but it would have to
01:06:34.400 be crazy corruption yeah like he's
01:06:36.240 talking these people talking about five
01:06:37.680 or six people bro yeah and that's the
01:06:39.680 petty [ __ ] no no it's not five or six
01:06:41.280 people they man
01:06:42.480 they've got them
01:06:43.760 i think they uncovered they uncovered
01:06:46.000 two
01:06:46.880 different things today in i want to say
01:06:49.200 it's michigan where they found uh a
01:06:51.839 memory card that had
01:06:54.079 more votes for trump than biden but it
01:06:56.400 still it was close it was like 1 000 for
01:06:59.039 biden and one thousand a few hundred for
01:07:01.680 trump like four or five hundred for
01:07:03.039 trump where'd he get the memory card
01:07:04.240 from son i do not know come on joe i
01:07:06.799 think there's a lot of [ __ ] gonna show
01:07:08.079 them you could have brought up any
01:07:09.280 memory card
01:07:10.559 so a [ __ ] is gonna get everyone
01:07:12.480 who's counting votes got the memory card
01:07:15.039 from the machines who told you that
01:07:16.559 story this is in the news
01:07:18.079 which news outlet it was in three or
01:07:20.240 four different ones and they all say the
01:07:21.839 same thing well they all said that there
01:07:23.599 was a memory card that was discovered
01:07:26.400 and they showed the counts in the memory
01:07:28.559 card but they've also found like other
01:07:30.400 ballots that didn't get counted yet
01:07:32.400 there's just a lot of disarray you're
01:07:33.839 dealing with human beings that are
01:07:35.839 counting millions of millions millions
01:07:38.400 and they're counting a lot of them just
01:07:40.000 paper they're getting mail and they're
01:07:41.760 opening it up and they have to find out
01:07:43.760 what i didn't understand that's what i
01:07:44.799 understand joe this was so funny it kind
01:07:46.559 of like backfired
01:07:48.240 right
01:07:49.039 that the mailing votes is what killed
01:07:51.280 trump that's what they're saying yeah
01:07:52.720 for the most part
01:07:54.000 and the funny thing about it trump has
01:07:55.760 the type of following that he literally
01:07:57.680 could tell him to do anything they're
01:07:58.799 going to do it he told [ __ ] not
01:08:01.760 to mail in yeah but he wanted to make a
01:08:04.160 point coming in in person well this is
01:08:06.480 how do you make that joke answer this
01:08:07.760 question how do you make that point i
01:08:09.280 understand making that point when you're
01:08:10.720 not in the middle of a [ __ ] pandemic
01:08:12.720 yeah you know what i'm saying like that
01:08:14.880 that would have been a great argument in
01:08:16.479 16. especially for old folks right
01:08:18.719 for anybody that wants to participate
01:08:21.759 but the only thing that would stop them
01:08:23.359 is if they're going to go outside and
01:08:24.719 risk their lives right so you're not
01:08:26.640 thinking to give that person an
01:08:28.158 opportunity to be a part of it yeah and
01:08:30.000 that's the part that kind of [ __ ] it
01:08:31.679 up well i don't know if he he definitely
01:08:33.839 wanted people to vote in person but did
01:08:35.600 he ever encourage people to vote by mail
01:08:37.359 as well or was it no he was always
01:08:38.880 saying that mail was going to get a
01:08:40.158 fraud son right this whole [ __ ] was
01:08:42.880 crowded i'm like [ __ ] duck somebody
01:08:45.679 secret service break the secret tell
01:08:47.439 this [ __ ]
01:08:49.279 yo somebody tell this [ __ ] that
01:08:51.520 the corona is out here
01:08:53.359 he caught it he knows it was out there
01:08:55.359 this [ __ ] caught it yeah right and gave
01:08:57.600 all the secret service it give away
01:09:00.319 secret service can't say nothing because
01:09:01.759 they see your service they got to keep
01:09:03.600 it a secret i'm sure they're young and
01:09:05.198 healthy too they probably shook it off
01:09:06.560 pretty easy decided people don't know
01:09:08.319 they probably got the same medicine he
01:09:09.520 got you know
01:09:10.880 the medicine is probably a lot of that
01:09:12.080 medicine is called your immune system
01:09:13.520 being up to par as much as like
01:09:15.439 everybody's talking about this [ __ ] it's
01:09:16.799 the lazy route no one wants to say just
01:09:18.799 a little bit of that but they also gave
01:09:20.238 him a bunch of experimental [ __ ] they
01:09:21.920 gave him these uh this antibiotic
01:09:23.920 antibody uh blood transfusion medication
01:09:27.198 they gave him uh what was it called
01:09:28.799 regeneron is that what it's called jamie
01:09:31.520 they gave him uh some other uh
01:09:34.399 i don't know if it's experimental or if
01:09:36.719 it's like recent recently been released
01:09:39.359 they gave him that that medication they
01:09:41.198 gave him a steroid they gave him uh a
01:09:43.600 bunch of different things all at once so
01:09:45.359 he got a cocktail [ __ ] that made him
01:09:47.198 feel great i was giving a slave not only
01:09:48.960 that how much is that cocktail that's
01:09:51.359 not no easy cocktail it's not cheap
01:09:54.158 and uh he wants that to be able to be
01:09:56.800 given to everybody but i don't know if
01:09:58.640 that's feasible at the moment
01:10:00.719 to make
01:10:02.159 well it's not just to make the money
01:10:03.679 just to make the doses like say if they
01:10:05.840 have all that medication and all the the
01:10:08.239 all that uh blood antibody medication
01:10:10.960 and all this different stuff they're
01:10:11.920 gonna give him the steroids
01:10:13.520 to make that for 300 million people
01:10:16.560 that's so many people so if everybody
01:10:18.960 gets sick you have a dose if we have one
01:10:21.600 dose for every human being in this
01:10:23.040 country
01:10:24.080 even if you have one dose for half you
01:10:25.520 can get it done if your money is right
01:10:27.679 you would need 300 million vials of this
01:10:30.880 [ __ ] that's so much you're not going to
01:10:33.280 need all of those and probably more than
01:10:34.560 that because they wouldn't even make
01:10:35.679 that files per person they wouldn't even
01:10:38.239 make that number for every for everybody
01:10:40.159 to get one they would make that number
01:10:41.920 like it's got to be that number is going
01:10:43.600 to be broken down by okay what's the
01:10:45.360 criteria to get this you know what i'm
01:10:47.360 saying well also it would be how many
01:10:48.880 people do we really want to get it to
01:10:50.320 because how many people are going to be
01:10:51.199 sick at any one given time it's probably
01:10:53.120 never going to be more than 25 of the
01:10:54.800 population even if it's high but even if
01:10:56.560 it comes out joe [ __ ] i'm
01:10:58.239 telling you the certain [ __ ]
01:11:00.400 are not taking that vaccine for whatever
01:11:02.080 reason yeah i think black communities
01:11:05.120 [ __ ] ain't [ __ ] with no vaccine it's
01:11:06.800 like a iphone so you need the third one
01:11:10.560 no black person is going to take it i
01:11:12.640 think there's a lot of people that are
01:11:13.760 not going to take it but i think what
01:11:14.880 they think is uh herd immunity once we
01:11:17.120 get to 50 of the people that took it the
01:11:19.440 virus will probably die off i think it's
01:11:21.679 going to be in that neighborhood of 50
01:11:23.440 of the people that had it if they if if
01:11:25.760 either 50 percent of the people either
01:11:27.600 have had covid or have the vaccine for
01:11:29.840 covid they think we can hit her immunity
01:11:31.920 and mostly die off but it could always
01:11:33.840 kick back in again that's what they're
01:11:35.280 worried about that it's going to be like
01:11:36.320 the common cold or the flu every year
01:11:37.840 would you take a vaccine yeah for sure
01:11:39.920 if it works yeah if it's been proven
01:11:41.920 that it works and i talk to doctors and
01:11:43.679 they explain what the science is and how
01:11:45.360 it works then i talk to people that have
01:11:47.040 taken it and they say you know what the
01:11:48.480 side effects are because um with the the
01:11:50.880 covid vaccine i think the side effects
01:11:52.800 are you feel like [ __ ] for a couple days
01:11:54.800 who can't deal with feeling like [ __ ]
01:11:56.159 for a couple years
01:11:58.000 you can't lose two days yeah um yeah i
01:12:00.880 would definitely do it if uh i thought
01:12:02.480 it was safe um i don't know enough about
01:12:04.800 it right now to say that i think i mean
01:12:07.280 that was one of the things that nicholas
01:12:08.400 christakis was talking about yesterday
01:12:10.000 he was talking about the potential
01:12:12.080 dangers of the vaccine and i appreciate
01:12:13.920 that he brought that up because it's
01:12:14.880 such a sensitive area for people they
01:12:16.800 think that if you think there's a danger
01:12:18.400 in any kind of vaccine you're some sort
01:12:19.679 of anti-vaxxer no there's a potential
01:12:22.080 for danger of any medication when you're
01:12:24.480 dealing with
01:12:26.000 mass numbers of human beings if you have
01:12:27.679 300 million people and you give them
01:12:29.199 aspirin one i don't know what percentage
01:12:31.679 but some people are going to die from
01:12:33.520 aspirin or they're going to get really
01:12:34.880 sick from aspirin
01:12:36.560 it's the same with everything
01:12:38.960 substances you put in people's bodies
01:12:40.719 everybody reacts differently people die
01:12:42.239 from [ __ ] brazil nuts you know
01:12:44.320 there's something yeah but [ __ ]
01:12:45.520 want to waste time with these home
01:12:46.640 remedies and [ __ ] man them home remedies
01:12:48.560 i mean they're cool for some people but
01:12:50.560 eventually man you have to talk to
01:12:52.239 somebody yeah for sure if you're if you
01:12:54.719 got a real disease you know if you
01:12:57.360 the people that want to cure like cancer
01:12:59.600 by not going to a doctor like whoa
01:13:02.880 they can fix it now like there's a lot
01:13:05.199 of cancers not all of them of course but
01:13:08.000 there's a lot of can you're way better
01:13:09.840 off having cancer now with modern
01:13:11.520 medicine than you were having it fifteen
01:13:13.440 twenty years ago
01:13:15.360 all that remedy [ __ ] all although like
01:13:17.440 the best remedy for all this besides the
01:13:20.000 medicine if you actually get sick so
01:13:21.920 [ __ ] take care of yourself right
01:13:24.239 that's what i'm hoping people get out of
01:13:25.760 this i don't understand why people know
01:13:27.760 that yeah i don't understand
01:13:30.000 this time i don't understand how you
01:13:31.760 could ignore that because it's
01:13:33.040 convenient as long as you're not sick
01:13:34.480 you don't think you're gonna get sick
01:13:35.760 right you stay home if you don't have to
01:13:37.600 go anywhere you just stay home and a lot
01:13:39.040 of people just they just
01:13:41.199 stop exercising they stop eating well
01:13:43.920 they stop drinking water and they [ __ ]
01:13:45.600 their body up and then if something does
01:13:47.600 you don't realize like how much of a
01:13:48.880 difference it makes and being healthy
01:13:51.120 and not being healthy when something
01:13:52.480 hits you a virus hits your cold hits you
01:13:54.960 you see like when when i got shot son
01:13:57.360 there you go
01:13:58.640 i had to get the iv i had to get the
01:14:00.400 [ __ ] um the um iv antibiotics well
01:14:03.520 you guys get ivs all the time you're
01:14:05.360 always doing uh vitamin ids on tour
01:14:07.840 right vital flow vitamin c it's a
01:14:09.520 company that's such a good move
01:14:11.440 it is
01:14:12.480 when we did that the first that was the
01:14:14.000 first time i'd ever done that well
01:14:15.679 really vitamin iv yeah i mean i'm maybe
01:14:17.840 i've done it yeah but you got you wanted

01:14:27.520 my ass and i saw your ass i was sitting
01:14:29.600 right there i'm like
01:14:31.199 i was like [ __ ] take that [ __ ] across
01:14:33.199 the street
01:14:34.640 he had his [ __ ] stomach out with his
01:14:37.040 ass out i was like i'm not scared i
01:14:38.960 don't i know you're not it was like
01:14:40.960 wow yeah well the the glutathione was
01:14:43.520 amazing um um that stuff is great uh the
01:14:46.880 vitamin drip was amazing we started
01:14:49.040 getting them uh every week we had we
01:14:50.960 slacked off though once we got here to
01:14:52.400 texas we haven't been doing it in texas
01:14:54.239 man that [ __ ] i'm telling you
01:14:55.920 about when i did yellow springs this
01:14:57.920 summer that was probably
01:14:59.679 one of the things that um
01:15:01.679 made that uh experience so amazing
01:15:04.800 is that we were living in our own bubble
01:15:07.360 and playing by our own rules and
01:15:09.120 everybody was having a good time and it
01:15:11.520 was all productive yeah you know it
01:15:13.600 worked it worked you guys put on a lot
01:15:15.679 of shows adult summer camps yeah
01:15:18.960 it was like
01:15:20.560 the shows were one thing
01:15:22.320 but the thing that was great for me was
01:15:24.320 just
01:15:25.440 the whole sense of community
01:15:27.679 you know what i'm saying like we would
01:15:28.719 have potlucks and [ __ ] and then i would
01:15:30.800 have all the housewives of yellow
01:15:32.400 springs like
01:15:33.600 ascendant yo
01:15:34.960 them [ __ ] out there don't
01:15:37.199 [ __ ] yellow spring chicks wives
01:15:39.760 they won't get upset with anything but a
01:15:41.520 casserole dish son
01:15:43.679 like they was looking for a rachel ray
01:15:45.760 castro this i had for like a week they
01:15:48.320 were stalking where i was living and
01:15:50.080 everything
01:15:51.199 but the sensor community man is like you
01:15:53.760 know there's one coffee shop dinos
01:15:55.760 everybody go there it's one grocery
01:15:58.000 store it's just one of everything that's
01:16:00.239 nice and it was so simple well that's
01:16:02.560 better really then this this there's
01:16:05.520 real good things about cities
01:16:07.440 but the thing that's missing is that
01:16:09.280 camaraderie that sense of community
01:16:11.199 nature yeah city slickers they were
01:16:13.040 calling me a city slave i saw the videos

01:21:44.800 something to think i'm pretty sure it's
01:21:46.080 done so i've never thought about it to
01:21:47.360 this moment but i'm sure there's got to
01:21:48.480 be a competition

01:22:25.440 shapiro video oh that's right that's
01:22:27.280 right that's right yeah which was it
01:22:30.960 because ben shapiro
01:22:32.880 ben shapiro
01:22:34.800 it was like you know when some people
01:22:36.159 self-own they don't realize they're
01:22:37.679 self-owning right
01:22:39.280 when you know the song's about wet ass
01:22:40.880 [ __ ] he's like well that sounds like a
01:22:42.159 gynecological condition i would
01:22:44.800 and
01:22:45.440 and people like what
01:22:48.080 but that's not the point i know the
01:22:50.000 point is but i understand that that's
01:22:51.520 like that's an that's i understand this
01:22:53.679 point that's an abnormal amount of
01:22:55.440 moisture yes to be able to come up with
01:22:58.560 a whole song about it
01:23:00.320 it's like it's a level what do you think
01:23:02.320 would happen if you came out with a song
01:23:03.520 called hard ass dick
01:23:05.360 i want to do it would not be
01:23:06.960 received that well as with as minimal
01:23:09.840 controversy as whatever certain songs
01:23:11.520 got to be answers
01:23:13.520 right like answers to a song to wear as
01:23:15.520 [ __ ]

01:23:31.679 answer songs and then like there's been
01:23:34.639 a bunch of those right where they would
01:23:36.560 someone would have a song and then
01:23:38.159 someone like

01:23:41.840 that like um scrubs

01:26:15.360 it's a candle man
01:26:17.679 don't disrespect that people one day
01:26:19.840 people get mad at soy soy is like a
01:26:22.159 political fruit or a vegetable is it
01:26:25.120 yeah yeah yeah people call you a soy boy
01:26:27.760 if you're a republican people call uh
01:26:30.000 weak men soy boys
01:26:31.920 that's like a it's an insult i never
01:26:34.239 knew that soy is one of the rare foods
01:26:36.239 that's actually attached to being a
01:26:37.600 [ __ ]
01:26:38.560 that's a [ __ ] food yeah like if you're
01:26:40.880 if you're a guy who's really in the soy
01:26:42.560 and this is not my perspective this is
01:26:44.800 just i just think it's a [ __ ] it's a
01:26:47.120 plant it doesn't matter to me right it's
01:26:49.120 uh isn't that edamame isn't that soy
01:26:51.120 like when you have edamame at a
01:26:53.679 japanese restaurant isn't it soy yes
01:26:55.679 yeah isn't that is that the case jamie
01:26:58.159 the first time i ever tried edamame i
01:27:00.159 was so ghetto
01:27:02.000 did you use the whole thing yeah and i
01:27:03.520 was like
01:27:04.800 i was like my throat was killing me son
01:27:06.960 the best part is the outside i didn't
01:27:08.719 know anything about it
01:27:10.320 salt and everything in the outside the
01:27:11.600 sea salt yeah some sea salt you have a
01:27:14.159 bowl of just edamame it takes away from
01:27:16.800 it you wouldn't even want it it's the
01:27:18.320 whole process yeah the whole process of
01:27:20.320 like ripping the sleeve edamame beans
01:27:22.800 are whole immature soybeans sometimes
01:27:25.120 referred to as vegetable vegetable type
01:27:27.199 soybeans they're green and different
01:27:29.199 color from regular soybeans which are
01:27:30.800 typically light brown tan or beige
01:27:33.120 yeah so it's the soy i like edamame i
01:27:36.000 don't mind soy but a lot of people think
01:27:37.920 of soy as being like a [ __ ] food
01:27:41.120 i never knew that i thought it was a
01:27:42.320 healthy i mean i knew that it was not
01:27:43.840 the most masculine food but i thought it
01:27:45.360 was like you stepped your game up when
01:27:47.360 you entered the edamame lane it's like
01:27:49.120 oh [ __ ] this [ __ ] eat edamame i
01:27:51.520 think there's a reason i think soy
01:27:54.080 lowers your testosterone i think there's
01:27:56.239 like estrogen yeah yeah soy isoflavones
01:27:59.199 can prov produce estrogen-like activity
01:28:01.679 in the body mimicking the effects of
01:28:03.920 natural estrogen yeah but i think you
01:28:06.320 can grow titties off of soy not quite
01:28:08.560 but it might feminize you it might
01:28:10.400 feminize you
01:28:11.679 plants plants affect your your hormone
01:28:14.080 production do you know they they
01:28:15.760 actually develop testosterone like
01:28:18.159 synthetic testosterone from wild yams
01:28:21.120 like plants yeah from wild wild yams
01:28:23.920 yeah that's how they that's how uh they
01:28:26.080 develop some um artificial testosterone
01:28:29.120 or exogenous testosterone i don't think
01:28:30.960 that that would be part of the whole
01:28:32.320 siteless um cialis and
01:28:34.400 blue pill era that's a different thing
01:28:36.239 though that's just blood flow that's
01:28:37.760 nitrous oxide so why is nobody promoting
01:28:40.639 wow nitrous oxide nitrous uh what is
01:28:43.120 what is it nitric
01:28:44.639 nitric oxide um
01:28:47.120 that's like uh no explode all those pump
01:28:49.840 things you do when you want to get
01:28:51.199 jacked when you're lifting weights a lot
01:28:52.960 of those those uh supplements they mimic
01:28:55.840 the same sort of effect just not the
01:28:57.520 same degree as like finasteride like ad
01:29:00.480 uh
01:29:01.199 like uh viagra and cialis and [ __ ] like
01:29:03.679 that but they don't they don't make you
01:29:05.440 have more testosterone with these
01:29:08.159 like soybeans and i i think really for
01:29:10.639 it to affect your hormones i think it's
01:29:12.320 just like it can it's a fat it's a
01:29:14.560 possibility like chemically but in order
01:29:17.280 to actually do it i think you'd have to
01:29:18.800 eat some [ __ ] preposterous number of
01:29:20.880 soybeans i don't think it's like
01:29:22.719 something people really have to worry
01:29:24.239 about it no i don't think it's anything
01:29:25.600 anybody really has to worry about but i
01:29:27.360 think it's just a stereotype i didn't
01:29:29.280 even know that the thing was that's hard
01:29:30.560 for me i didn't even know the stereotype
01:29:32.159 yeah they called
01:29:33.120 boys i didn't know that i thought it was
01:29:34.960 like uh uh like you you're evolving as a
01:29:37.760 foodie
01:29:38.719 you know like the first time i had i was
01:29:40.400 like oh [ __ ] y'all [ __ ] don't know
01:29:41.840 about the edamames
01:29:43.520 because i was introduced to somebody
01:29:44.719 else to it but i didn't know that it
01:29:45.840 symbolized being a [ __ ] it doesn't it's
01:29:48.239 silly it's people are silly it tastes
01:29:50.320 good yeah adam may taste good if they do
01:29:52.480 it right
01:29:53.440 put a little chili powder and salt on
01:29:55.440 the outside i like it with just sea salt
01:29:58.239 i like it sea salt too i'm working at a

01:30:45.920 he created the bubble and he [ __ ] did
01:30:47.840 it created a bubble stayed drunk the
01:30:49.840 entire summer
01:30:51.120 and enjoyed it had a good time i'm doing
01:30:53.280 rfk stadium it's the original um stadium
01:30:55.440 for the uh
01:30:56.639 for the um washington redskins the
01:30:58.239 washington redskins used to do that
01:31:00.000 beautiful but for nine years that was my
01:31:02.560 uh traditional show at the dc improv i
01:31:05.760 would do thanksgiving weekend it was a
01:31:07.679 good time for me because i got to see my
01:31:09.040 family
01:31:09.920 i got to work that's a great club too so
01:31:12.080 great dc that dc improv is one of the 10
01:31:14.800 greatest clubs in the country and it's
01:31:16.400 been probably the most consistent for 25
01:31:18.719 years so good it's just the perfect size
01:31:21.120 perfect everything about it's perfect
01:31:22.800 and they get every year solid it's i
01:31:25.040 don't even know that a comic can do bad
01:31:27.520 in terms of ticket sales there everybody
01:31:29.199 seems to do well at least the lineup
01:31:30.800 they have they book good lineups like
01:31:32.639 when the club's got that much prestige
01:31:34.639 they've been around that there's certain
01:31:36.080 clubs like comedy works where people
01:31:37.600 just trust them you know uh
01:31:40.080 there's a bunch of helium in philly
01:31:42.159 people just trust them this is going to
01:31:43.360 be a good show they're not going to book
01:31:44.320 any scrubs right and that's that's how
01:31:46.800 the dc improv has felt like they have
01:31:48.960 developed a community a real and i for
01:31:51.199 nine years i saw my son
01:31:53.280 from the first time i took him up it was
01:31:55.040 just him in my arms
01:31:57.199 and then the next time he was kind of
01:31:58.719 like crawling there next time he was
01:32:00.159 walking
01:32:01.120 then he walked to the stage i had like
01:32:03.120 four years of pictures of his growth
01:32:05.360 there and then because of the pandemic i
01:32:08.080 thought the weekend was i'm like damn
01:32:09.840 that blows a tradition yeah and then
01:32:12.080 they piv they made a pivot from the dc
01:32:13.920 improv
01:32:14.960 to partnering up with um dc pull up or
01:32:17.600 whatever it is and they're doing the
01:32:19.280 [ __ ] outside show that's beautiful
01:32:21.520 i like that people are adapting it's one
01:32:23.280 of the things you're saying like you
01:32:24.320 started this business and bert started
01:32:26.239 doing things outside and tom segura's
01:32:28.239 doing like these pay-per-view shows tom
01:32:30.480 segura and burke crusher are doing these
01:32:32.320 and and sometimes christina they switch
01:32:34.400 up back and forth right they're doing
01:32:35.760 these
01:32:36.639 crazy live shows i saw they the [ __ ]
01:32:39.600 that he sent me i mean i'll show it to
01:32:41.679 you after the show the things that they
01:32:43.679 can see during these live shows it's a
01:32:46.080 hundred percent uncensored because it's
01:32:48.000 pay-per-view so they don't have to worry
01:32:49.760 about youtube they don't have to worry
01:32:51.280 about that just whatever they are
01:32:52.880 showing the most [ __ ] up videos i have
01:32:55.679 ever seen in my life
01:32:57.360 in my life really in my life
01:33:00.560 like he he sent me three things
01:33:03.360 yesterday that changed my idea of what's
01:33:05.840 possible
01:33:06.800 oh my god yeah you gonna do it
01:33:09.440 do one of his shows yeah
01:33:11.440 um i would certainly do it if we were in
01:33:13.199 town together and he's you know tom's
01:33:15.360 talking about moving here if he moves
01:33:16.880 here everybody [ __ ] moving out here
01:33:18.719 yeah we got the whole squad coming back
01:33:20.960 here we're going to open up a club here
01:33:22.560 i'm down son come on down it's better
01:33:24.880 here you don't have to pay taxes for
01:33:26.239 state people are nicer to the bus they
01:33:27.920 said the street on the streets they said
01:33:30.320 on the streets they said joey stupid son
01:33:35.040 this tree said that [ __ ] said i'm
01:33:36.480 getting the [ __ ] up out of here son well
01:33:38.400 i saw the writing on the wall i'm like
01:33:40.000 they're not going to open up the clubs
01:33:41.280 if you don't have a comedy club open i
01:33:42.880 can't stay if i'm if if the comedy store
01:33:45.280 was open there would be no reason for me
01:33:46.800 to leave valley i know but then
01:33:48.880 at the same the same on the flip of that
01:33:52.080 uh just because it's not open it's not
01:33:54.880 there's no reason for you to be in that
01:33:56.800 line be that you can create it well the
01:33:58.960 only time i could create it though is in
01:34:00.719 an absence of the club so because i
01:34:03.360 wouldn't ask people hey leave la the
01:34:05.360 comedy store is hopping and killing come
01:34:07.280 to come to austin but when you can't
01:34:09.520 open they can't they're not allowing
01:34:11.600 them to open and it could be years who
01:34:13.760 the [ __ ] knows now right here we are now
01:34:16.159 eight months in no one ever we thought
01:34:17.840 it was two weeks but do you remember
01:34:19.199 when you thought it was two weeks two
01:34:20.639 weeks but then again even moving forward
01:34:22.480 joe we you gotta remove the possibility
01:34:25.040 of something taken
01:34:26.960 you gotta remove yourself from the
01:34:28.239 possibility of somebody taking something
01:34:30.159 away from you
01:34:31.440 and like like that yeah like that like
01:34:33.520 like what you the way you're thinking
01:34:35.760 and the way dave has thought throughout
01:34:37.679 this summer is i was like yo we really
01:34:40.000 can make this [ __ ] well also what we
01:34:42.480 were saying before that we were all
01:34:44.000 connected to hollywood because we
01:34:45.520 thought we needed hollywood right in
01:34:47.199 order to get us on television in order
01:34:49.119 to pay our bills we needed to get hired
01:34:51.760 and then once podcasting came along i
01:34:54.239 think people realize no you don't you
01:34:56.000 just need your friends and you have a
01:34:57.840 bunch of funny friends and everybody's
01:34:59.600 tight and everybody tells people hey go
01:35:01.760 see you know theo vaughn's at this place
01:35:04.239 go see this guy go see that guy and we
01:35:06.719 all get along together we don't need
01:35:08.320 anybody else yo but joe the toughest
01:35:09.840 part
01:35:11.199 what did i notice in this podcast world
01:35:14.159 which is predominantly white that's the
01:35:16.080 truth of it you know what i'm saying
01:35:17.280 it's like there's a lot more white cos
01:35:19.280 podcasters when it comes that when you
01:35:21.199 say like the friendship part of making
01:35:22.560 money they really
01:35:24.800 about that life they really do it yeah
01:35:26.960 they really do it they don't talk about
01:35:28.560 it every one of the guys that i've done
01:35:31.360 you know from
01:35:32.560 the leah from bobby from the whole crew
01:35:35.679 it's never no oh man it's like everybody
01:35:38.000 helps everybody yeah everybody's
01:35:39.600 friendly and there's only a few people
01:35:41.199 in the podcast world that don't have
01:35:42.719 friends they're weirdos
01:35:44.880 i don't know they're out in the fridges
01:35:46.560 they're out in the fringes all right
01:35:47.840 those poor people they they're they
01:35:50.159 a lot of people go into things with like
01:35:52.159 a legacy attitude and the legacy
01:35:54.320 attitude that you know from radio is to
01:35:56.159 competing against the other people that
01:35:57.360 are doing the same thing right but the
01:35:58.960 podcast world is not like that but some
01:36:00.719 people are like that like some people
01:36:01.920 will complain if a guest is on this
01:36:04.000 podcast and then on their podcast
01:36:06.080 they'll complain like you were just on
01:36:07.520 that podcast now it's going to take away
01:36:09.520 from people listening to me i got more
01:36:11.440 [ __ ] to talk about you ain't got no life
01:36:13.840 well not yo i never understood that
01:36:15.679 suddenly like oh i'm like [ __ ] every
01:36:18.239 podcast i go on
01:36:20.000 it's talking about
01:36:22.400 something else not only that but if you
01:36:24.639 go on a podcast and they like you if you
01:36:27.040 go on a podcast and they like you and
01:36:29.040 then i hear now you're gonna go on
01:36:30.400 bobby's podcast i'm gonna watch you on
01:36:32.080 that podcast too right because it's not
01:36:34.159 like i'm gonna like i do one podcast and
01:36:36.800 now i'm out of time but i've got more
01:36:39.199 time there's you're going to have

01:37:57.119 little assets people excited yeah yeah
01:37:59.280 but yo you like everything you said it
01:38:01.360 was like once i got out of the mode like

01:38:05.760 episode i'm like wait a minute did i
01:38:07.360 start looking at the numbers of the most

01:38:24.480 terrible right it's terrible we we
01:38:26.880 didn't even think it was a podcast
01:38:30.159 we were doing it with uh just answering
01:38:32.239 questions over twitter and being stupid
01:38:34.080 while we were high
01:38:35.280 no one thought it was ever going to be
01:38:36.960 something that millions of people listen
01:38:38.560 to so when we started it out it wasn't
01:38:42.080 you know there was no expectations now
01:38:43.920 people have expectations they went out
01:38:46.000 you realize like how much money is in it
01:38:48.320 you see all these people that get big
01:38:49.679 deals you see all these people that are
01:38:51.679 you know number one on itunes and number
01:38:54.159 two on [ __ ] spotify and you go [ __ ]
01:38:57.280 like there's a lot going on this is a
01:38:59.520 whole network that you don't need a lot
01:39:01.760 to get into
01:39:03.040 man the number one thing you have to do
01:39:05.600 and i kept tricking myself we had talked
01:39:07.440 about it was talking can you talk
01:39:10.560 that's ridiculous that you don't think
01:39:11.840 that you could talk
01:39:13.600 it's one of the most funny things i've
01:39:14.880 ever heard
01:39:17.760 son i mean with no response just like me
01:39:21.360 talking to myself that's easy you know
01:39:23.440 what i'm saying it's like you know i got
01:39:25.679 a better chance of making a thousand
01:39:27.360 people left in one person true you know
01:39:30.960 yeah but it's been a it's been a great
01:39:33.360 ride man
01:39:35.040 i do dairy over there julius you know
01:39:37.360 who's the best at just talking bill burr
01:39:40.480 that [ __ ] just he never has a
01:39:44.320 dead moment he will start on a subject
01:39:46.880 and like you know and then you know what
01:39:48.400 they want to [ __ ] do and then
01:39:50.880 i used to be an hour later he was one of
01:39:52.960 the guys that had it i was like
01:39:55.199 what would your style be more like i
01:39:57.360 just like i don't want to [ __ ] talk
01:39:58.960 to nobody
01:40:00.239 i just want to say what i want to
01:40:01.600 [ __ ] say and [ __ ] you
01:40:03.360 and then it was like the monday rant or
01:40:05.119 something yeah monday morning podcast
01:40:06.880 monday morning podcast and it was just
01:40:08.400 like that was like this [ __ ] can
01:40:10.719 talk [ __ ] for whatever it's like
01:40:12.719 whatever it's like a dude that goes he
01:40:15.360 like wins all the bar fight
01:40:17.119 conversations and it's the perfect
01:40:19.119 platform for that oh for bill it's a
01:40:20.719 perfect platform one of the things he
01:40:22.159 used to do is he used to use his cell
01:40:24.239 phone and this is when oh god the early
01:40:27.280 days of the monday morning podcast i
01:40:28.800 don't know when it started i bet you it
01:40:30.159 had to be around
01:40:31.520 2000
01:40:33.119 um 678 somewhere around there it could
01:40:35.840 be i don't remember but what i do
01:40:37.679 remember is that he he did a bunch of
01:40:39.280 them where he like left voicemails
01:40:41.520 so he would call himself or call a
01:40:43.520 service and leave a voicemail really so
01:40:45.840 he'd be sitting there at the airport
01:40:47.840 talking [ __ ] about some dude's haircut
01:40:50.800 oh yeah i remember those yeah
01:40:52.800 yeah and then he had somewhere it was
01:40:54.239 just just him really ranting just yeah
01:40:56.239 the audio quality was [ __ ] terrible
01:40:58.400 because he was literally talking into an
01:41:00.480 old phone
01:41:01.840 at the airport and then leaving a
01:41:03.440 message somewhere and that message
01:41:05.600 became the podcast and you know what
01:41:08.159 and it was hilarious it didn't even
01:41:09.760 matter the quality of the sound the idea
01:41:11.520 was funny just like when i told you that
01:41:14.000 time when jamie was supposed to help me
01:41:15.600 produce and then he [ __ ] reneged on
01:41:17.280 me
01:41:18.719 right
01:41:19.520 right he got real mad at me whatever
01:41:22.239 i remember it's like it was yesterday
01:41:24.560 um i understand i don't know how those
01:41:26.080 two are connected but but bill burr
01:41:28.800 when he when he first started out like
01:41:30.560 that was literally the perfect platform
01:41:32.320 for him
01:41:33.280 in podcasting like he's good at
01:41:34.719 interviewing people i've been on a show
01:41:36.560 before other people have been on the
01:41:38.080 show before he'll he'll sit and talk to
01:41:39.760 people he's fine at it but as far as
01:41:41.679 like ranting he's the best
01:41:44.080 yeah
01:41:46.880 yeah but he's also been doing it the
01:41:48.320 longest you got to think how many
01:41:49.840 [ __ ] years he's been doing that
01:41:52.000 podcast where he just that muscle is
01:41:54.480 flexed that muscle is tight he doesn't
01:41:57.040 need like
01:41:58.320 you can form an opinion but he doesn't
01:41:59.760 need the response most people right need
01:42:02.000 the response and the feedback how
01:42:04.320 how else do you know if you're doing
01:42:05.679 good or not yeah he doesn't think about
01:42:07.360 that he's like and another thing
01:42:09.679 i was watching seth meyer the other
01:42:11.679 night and it was a he was doing this
01:42:13.920 monologue or whatever and it was going
01:42:16.000 okay and then um
01:42:18.639 uh he uh
01:42:20.800 some people in the background were
01:42:21.920 laughing and you could just see
01:42:24.320 the posture and everything change once
01:42:26.560 he got a couple of people laughing it
01:42:27.840 was like that's important i heard his
01:42:29.760 netflix specials good really yeah yeah i
01:42:32.480 saw a clip on it it did not look bad it
01:42:34.880 did not look bad when this is this
01:42:36.400 recent because i know he had one i want
01:42:38.320 to say his netflix special was at least
01:42:40.159 a year ago because it was pre-pandemic
01:42:41.920 for sure i didn't see the entire thing
01:42:43.360 and i saw some clips and i was like this
01:42:45.600 is good delivery good writing and i'm
01:42:48.239 not i don't know that seth meyers like
01:42:50.480 really had a long background stand up
01:42:53.040 did he no he had a background doing that
01:42:55.920 show doing the monologue for the show
01:42:58.000 but
01:42:59.040 i i i don't think his stand-up was very
01:43:01.360 good
01:43:02.719 whoa i thought it was solid did you ever
01:43:04.480 see it jamie it's fine it came out the
01:43:06.719 other october
01:43:08.320 you all right jesus that's not a good
01:43:10.639 time to be coffin
01:43:12.639 it was uh very good
01:43:15.040 into what i saw the clips i didn't watch
01:43:17.040 the whole thing but but most of the guys
01:43:19.119 when they um
01:43:20.719 do snl
01:43:22.840 uh you know there's some people that
01:43:24.719 have done talk shows and then tried to
01:43:27.040 do a
01:43:28.000 stand-up special and they don't really
01:43:29.440 have the chops for it but that didn't
01:43:31.360 seem like that with him yeah he seemed
01:43:33.199 very relaxed right was kind of peaceful
01:43:35.199 wow well he probably
01:43:37.040 he probably did the right thing too he
01:43:38.400 probably hired a bunch of writers i mean
01:43:39.840 i didn't see all of it maybe the part
01:43:41.440 that i saw was the only funny thing i
01:43:42.719 really have no idea a lot of those guys
01:43:44.480 i guess when they like when i get to be
01:43:46.480 buried into that show like that yeah so
01:43:48.639 i don't really have time to go out and
01:43:50.080 work out and no it's hard it worked out
01:43:52.639 but if you could do it like jimmy kimmel
01:43:54.239 could do stand up for sure hundred
01:43:55.840 percent jimmy kimmel wanted to stand up
01:43:58.080 100 percent he could do it what do you
01:43:59.600 think about jim carrey on snl
01:44:01.760 i didn't watch it none of it nope not
01:44:03.679 one piece of it not a piece god damn son
01:44:06.239 i got [ __ ] to do
01:44:07.600 if i'm gonna watch something
01:44:09.280 um i generally when i get home i like to
01:44:11.520 watch like
01:44:13.280 things that have nothing to do what's
01:44:14.800 going on right now by the end of the day
01:44:17.199 i don't oh you like documentaries yeah
01:44:19.679 new netflix special lets you skip the
01:44:22.480 trump jokes oh you there's a button you
01:44:24.560 could skip job jokes yeah if you're
01:44:26.480 interested on netflix you could see
01:44:27.760 that's the chunk of stuff but this is
01:44:29.600 him talking to people so he's
01:44:30.880 interviewing people this is just an
01:44:32.080 interview about it oh interview about it
01:44:34.639 oh okay
01:44:35.679 oh that's funny yeah well that's a good
01:44:37.280 move because people are tired of trump
01:44:38.639 jokes you know that's one of those
01:44:40.480 people enough already man i've been
01:44:42.880 tired of them and then i'm like they're
01:44:44.880 coming back around before they're coming
01:44:46.880 to be frustrated
01:44:49.199 to be frustrated when a dude is on his
01:44:50.960 way out
01:44:52.000 you know it doesn't make no sense it's
01:44:53.440 like he is still getting to you
01:44:55.679 you know it's just a matter of time if
01:44:57.920 you want to say
01:44:59.679 the people the voice of the peoples was
01:45:02.000 heard it was a close
01:45:03.520 situation but it is what it is and he's
01:45:06.000 gone why are you still mad people have
01:45:08.000 some legitimate gripes and i understand
01:45:09.840 where they're coming from but my
01:45:11.199 perspective is it's not changing
01:45:13.280 anything and it's not doing you any good
01:45:16.239 to still be holding on you're if you are
01:45:18.719 a anti-trump biden
01:45:21.199 i mean i don't think
01:45:22.800 it's 99 official right i mean they just
01:45:25.520 haven't said it yet and they when they
01:45:27.440 say it then he will be become president
01:45:30.320 and then
01:45:31.280 kamal harris will be the new vice
01:45:32.639 president so
01:45:34.960 concentrate on good votes now it's over
01:45:37.520 right but people are so obsessed i heard
01:45:40.000 the [ __ ] the other day i might have
01:45:41.360 said this earlier look at mike pence and
01:45:43.600 i'm having a meeting with no mess
01:45:45.600 man okay why you still
01:45:48.560 keep getting mad because this
01:45:49.600 [ __ ] don't have a mask on it's
01:45:51.760 got to be something else to talk about
01:45:53.119 son but this they they want to talk
01:45:55.040 about negative things that's the thing
01:45:56.639 some people get addicted to talking
01:45:58.159 about negative things and they can't
01:45:59.600 regroup even after a victory and now
01:46:02.080 focus on positive things they want to
01:46:03.520 continue to focus on negative things and
01:46:05.440 i can see their perspective too
01:46:07.280 especially with all these crazy tweets
01:46:08.880 like i won that election you know it's
01:46:11.040 all fraud it's all this it's all that
01:46:12.800 like
01:46:13.679 man if you've got some real claims and i
01:46:16.639 don't know what the claims are i haven't
01:46:17.840 really honestly investigated them but if
01:46:19.440 you've got some real claims you got to
01:46:21.199 present the evidence and then once you
01:46:24.159 present the evidence you say all the
01:46:26.320 stuff like i got robbed i really want it
01:46:28.480 if you want to be in a position where
01:46:30.480 you're respected right if you're the
01:46:32.320 president of the united states this
01:46:34.000 isn't a regular guy it's not like if you
01:46:36.639 were involved in some
01:46:38.480 ridiculous like small neighborhood
01:46:41.920 election and you were joking around on
01:46:43.760 twitter i won that [ __ ] election
01:46:45.600 right that's that's that's to be
01:46:47.360 expected but when someone's in a
01:46:49.119 position where they're in charge of the
01:46:50.719 nuclear football
01:46:52.159 they literally are the
01:46:53.760 commander-in-chief of the greatest army
01:46:55.119 of the world he's never known
01:46:56.080 [ __ ] you're saying [ __ ] like
01:46:57.760 that and firing people that don't agree
01:46:59.679 with you no fireman fire [ __ ]
01:47:02.000 did like i know these other places like
01:47:04.080 what this would be a great time for
01:47:06.400 a [ __ ] terrorist attack right now
01:47:08.400 well one of the guys he fired what the
01:47:10.800 guy said was he didn't believe there was
01:47:12.880 widespread voter fraud he's like you're
01:47:14.480 fired if you don't believe that you're
01:47:16.239 fired
01:47:17.360 like this is this is like a madman the
01:47:20.000 interesting part for me is like
01:47:22.960 you trying to
01:47:25.840 switch the thoughts of a person that is
01:47:29.440 a huge trump fan
01:47:31.360 is a waste of time it's only gonna be
01:47:34.239 the only thing you're going to be is
01:47:35.440 frustrated see here's the thing though
01:47:37.920 i don't know and this is where it's
01:47:40.080 really important
01:47:41.440 i don't know
01:47:42.880 exactly
01:47:44.960 how the election went down in terms of
01:47:47.199 like was there like
01:47:48.960 0.01
01:47:50.960 fraud
01:47:51.920 was was there
01:47:53.679 0.5 percent for how much fraud was there
01:47:56.159 we gotta assume that when there's people
01:47:57.679 counting stuff there's some [ __ ]
01:47:59.520 going on yeah but the [ __ ] that's
01:48:01.119 been reported it's been like still no
01:48:03.040 more like 40 people bro and then the
01:48:05.280 only other problem is that it's all done
01:48:07.760 through these machines right and then
01:48:10.080 there's been
01:48:11.440 all these conspiracy theories about
01:48:14.000 machines that were supposed to have been
01:48:16.719 giving the votes to trump gave those
01:48:18.960 boats to biden now i could repeat those
01:48:21.280 things but i don't know if they're true
01:48:23.840 but i don't know what i do know is what
01:48:25.040 i'm saying i do notice it but i know
01:48:26.880 georgia
01:48:28.080 i know the [ __ ] pulled all of
01:48:30.159 envelopes up to the building and they
01:48:32.800 cut them open and they took a man by
01:48:34.880 hand
01:48:36.080 they did them hand by hand yo those
01:48:38.480 those ones that were recounts or
01:48:40.239 whatever those you can't is no machine
01:48:42.880 that it's hand by hand right it's
01:48:45.199 [ __ ] probably and how does that work
01:48:46.719 did they does someone watch while they
01:48:48.239 do it like do they have a supervisor
01:48:49.840 because i would imagine you would want
01:48:51.280 to have like almost like two people
01:48:52.800 watch while one person does it which is
01:48:54.719 so ridiculous but it seems like you kind
01:48:57.119 of if you don't trust your view
01:49:02.080 that's part of the argument that trump's
01:49:04.159 administration was saying too was that
01:49:05.920 there were
01:49:06.880 certain counts that they weren't allowed
01:49:08.800 to observe they had to be really far
01:49:10.239 away and they couldn't actually see
01:49:13.440 listen that sounds like people that like
01:49:15.119 soybeans so
01:49:16.960 but that's the first thing
01:49:18.719 is that's a very soy boy attitude but
01:49:22.080 what if they're telling the truth here's
01:49:23.760 the thing i don't know and you don't
01:49:25.040 know either so if they were telling the
01:49:26.719 truth and people were counting votes
01:49:29.199 incorrectly or they find no evidence of
01:49:32.080 that every time they i don't think they
01:49:33.280 have either every time that they they
01:49:35.040 came out with all these losses and
01:49:36.719 they're dropping them dropping them
01:49:38.239 because there's no evidence of it he's
01:49:39.679 probably made he's he's had to have made
01:49:42.480 every argument he can make no listen i
01:49:44.719 agree with you i agree with you
01:49:47.119 there's no evidence that they can
01:49:49.679 present that's going to show people
01:49:52.159 right now
01:49:53.360 that there was so much voter fraud that
01:49:56.080 they got to return everything and start
01:49:57.920 all over or they got to give it to trump
01:49:59.599 like i agree with you i think this is
01:50:01.040 what all these experts are saying
01:50:02.400 they're all saying that even if there
01:50:04.080 was voter fraud it wasn't enough to tilt
01:50:06.400 the election one way or another but i
01:50:07.920 don't know
01:50:09.119 how these machines work so if i'm even
01:50:11.520 commenting on it if i'm saying they
01:50:13.440 couldn't have done it that's ridiculous
01:50:15.119 i'm saying they must have done it that's
01:50:16.880 just as ridiculous i really don't know
01:50:19.199 that's like when you're talking about
01:50:21.199 voting you're talking about
01:50:23.280 how many
01:50:24.639 millions of people are voting and all
01:50:26.320 this information is coming in and they
01:50:28.480 gotta sort it out you're gonna have some
01:50:30.960 mistakes there's no way around it but
01:50:33.679 the question is does it overall balance
01:50:36.960 out or other mistakes all for one side
01:50:40.239 if you find out the mistakes are all for
01:50:42.000 biden then you're gonna go huh
01:50:45.119 really well who who owns the company
01:50:47.679 that makes the machines and then how are
01:50:50.239 they financed and who programmed that
01:50:52.159 and how are they programmed is it
01:50:53.760 possible to [ __ ] with the data it is
01:50:55.440 possible can you show me how to do it
01:50:57.280 you can do it you should but so
01:51:01.119 about the vote everybody wants to know
01:51:02.880 exactly what happened i think but very
01:51:05.280 few people that know exactly what
01:51:07.440 happened i know i know the machines and
01:51:09.440 all that type of [ __ ] but when they take
01:51:10.800 the machines away and they say okay
01:51:12.960 we're counting these hand by hand
01:51:15.280 the the the results of that have to be
01:51:17.360 official yeah well they definitely like
01:51:19.599 that i understand like the machines but
01:51:21.119 they was like
01:51:22.320 these melon [ __ ] was they
01:51:24.719 they've had to [ __ ] count every vote
01:51:27.360 yeah it's a matter of how they're
01:51:28.560 recording it right you would want to
01:51:30.000 make sure that everybody recorded it
01:51:31.280 accurately i don't know how they do it
01:51:33.280 but i would imagine
01:51:35.920 that when i when i was talking to a guy
01:51:37.440 like mike baker and who's saying that
01:51:39.280 even if there was fraud there's not
01:51:41.199 enough fraud to overturn i would imagine
01:51:42.800 he knows some things
01:51:44.639 yep
01:51:45.679 i don't i'm a [ __ ] so with me talking
01:51:48.400 about he wants we all do that you know
01:51:49.920 we talk about he won she won and there's
01:51:51.440 no way there was fraud or it was
01:51:52.800 definitely fraud or i think trump won by
01:51:55.040 a landslide like people get
01:51:57.280 they get real um
01:51:59.040 connected they get real connected to
01:52:00.880 who's who's winning or losing this
01:52:02.320 election and i get it i mean i'm gonna
01:52:04.239 miss donald trump son
01:52:06.320 yo he's not going anywhere man tv man
01:52:08.960 i'm gonna miss him on tv this
01:52:10.320 [ __ ]
01:52:11.840 tv persona is you know what sucks what
01:52:14.320 sucks that it's his tv persona is like
01:52:17.199 he's a tv [ __ ] it sucks that
01:52:19.520 it's even possible that someone could
01:52:22.400 monkey with an
01:52:23.840 election to the point where
01:52:25.760 you change the outcome
01:52:27.679 it sucks that that's even a thought that
01:52:29.599 we could get into our head
01:52:31.599 that's what's one of the crazy things
01:52:33.520 about people we're so nuts but that
01:52:35.520 wasn't it we believe in a side like
01:52:37.840 people that are good people
01:52:39.920 will do some shady [ __ ] to have their
01:52:41.920 candidate win
01:52:43.199 yeah for sure that's politics
01:52:46.800 we're so crazy that's politics anything
01:52:49.679 goes
01:52:50.960 anything goes yeah so what what bothers
01:52:53.440 me and i do think that biden won the
01:52:55.599 election and i do think that i mean i
01:52:57.679 think there's probably some shenanigans
01:52:59.280 but i think the result is most likely
01:53:01.360 correct
01:53:02.880 but
01:53:04.080 it bothers me that there's even a
01:53:05.920 question it bothers me that anyone would
01:53:07.760 ever think that anyone could but i think
01:53:10.560 that there's republicans the democrats
01:53:12.560 could do it and i think there's
01:53:13.760 democrats that think republicans can do
01:53:15.440 it and i think
01:53:17.679 it's it's going to be real hard to 100
01:53:20.400 trust the election that's one of the
01:53:21.920 things that's kind of dangerous about
01:53:24.000 someone going after it this election is
01:53:26.400 rigged this election is rigged when
01:53:28.000 trump is doing that he's encouraging p
01:53:30.560 and you know maybe that's a good thing
01:53:32.560 if they are rigged because maybe they're
01:53:34.560 going to be able to figure out how to
01:53:35.760 stop that from happening in the future
01:53:37.599 or maybe it's going to erode or maybe
01:53:39.360 it's going to road people's confidence
01:53:40.639 in the elections and the more he does it
01:53:42.000 the more it erodes and more gets
01:53:43.280 dangerous there's a real argument for
01:53:45.119 that too but
01:53:46.880 listen again i'm i don't know what the
01:53:48.560 [ __ ] i'm talking about man
01:53:50.639 it's just
01:53:54.560 i know it's nuts it's nuts that you
01:53:56.239 would anybody would ever think there'd
01:53:58.400 be any
01:53:59.920 voter fraud on either side but we know
01:54:02.480 that people have done it like that's
01:54:04.000 apparently how they got jfk in wasn't
01:54:06.400 there like some crazy conspiracy about
01:54:08.239 the mob
01:54:09.280 rigged votes for jfk and that's how he
01:54:11.360 became wasn't that a thing jamie yeah
01:54:14.080 i've heard has that ever been proven
01:54:15.599 i've heard talks about recently that
01:54:17.040 they were in such odds with each other
01:54:18.560 that they would never have helped
01:54:20.320 him i think he was really at odds with
01:54:22.880 them afterwards because he didn't like
01:54:24.719 there was the the the thought was that
01:54:26.639 was one of the reasons why he was
01:54:27.679 assassinated that he kind of doubled
01:54:29.840 back on his agreement with the mob
01:54:31.280 explanation i heard they were just
01:54:32.320 helping uh local politicians oh he
01:54:34.400 didn't play the streets to the president
01:54:36.080 well his family were drug runners
01:54:39.119 the kennedys were moonshiners and they
01:54:41.440 made their money selling bootleg liquor
01:54:44.080 during during the time where it was
01:54:45.679 illegal they were basically drug dealers
01:54:47.920 and then they became this gigantic
01:54:49.520 political dynasty they were the trump no
01:54:52.000 not the trump family but they
01:54:53.599 [ __ ] they were more gangster
01:54:55.280 than the trump family really because
01:54:56.880 their their literal background was in
01:54:59.360 drug running
01:55:00.960 like
01:55:01.920 bootleg liquor like moonshot is drugs
01:55:04.480 that's drug running you just don't think
01:55:06.159 of it now because alcohol is legal
01:55:09.360 they were truck runners yeah and who had
01:55:11.760 the [ __ ] connected to the mob and they
01:55:13.840 were connected to the mob like you don't
01:55:15.840 think they [ __ ] with some numbers you
01:55:18.080 don't you don't think there was some
01:55:19.440 corruption who has the [ __ ] money i
01:55:22.000 think there's an assumption too that
01:55:23.280 both sides are going to try to do it i
01:55:25.199 mean that was why that was uh a water
01:55:27.360 gate right the results of this election
01:55:29.280 man it's going to be interesting to see
01:55:31.760 can can can biden work with two parties
01:55:34.480 both parties i hope so i hope they i i
01:55:37.199 hope they prove
01:55:38.560 like
01:55:39.360 the polarization of people that are
01:55:41.360 opposed to uh trump being in office and
01:55:43.760 now they're not republicans and
01:55:45.119 democrats i hope they work together yeah
01:55:47.920 man that's what i hope
01:55:49.679 that's what i help i hope they work
01:55:50.960 together do it faster biden has done got
01:55:53.119 like a lot of time you got to get used
01:55:54.960 to president kamala that's what you got
01:55:56.800 to get used to i said it man she's going
01:55:58.880 to be the first president
01:56:00.639 i said it that's the position i don't
01:56:02.560 see how he can do eight years so what if
01:56:04.239 the economy i don't want to be strong in
01:56:05.920 four i think four he's going to keep it
01:56:07.599 moving man
01:56:08.960 who knows it's a setup i said it on
01:56:10.480 stage i said
01:56:12.000 get ready for your first female black
01:56:14.400 president because this is the setup for
01:56:16.320 her she certainly could win she they
01:56:18.639 grooming it she could she certainly
01:56:20.159 could take over too if he dies or if he
01:56:22.239 can't medically continue anymore but
01:56:24.639 here's another thing you got to think of
01:56:26.239 they're doing [ __ ] to people
01:56:28.400 that they're doing some wild [ __ ] in
01:56:30.159 terms of medicine and regenerative
01:56:31.920 medicine and stem cells and they just
01:56:33.920 hook them up to stem cells every day
01:56:36.000 shoot them up with nad and vitamin feeds
01:56:38.480 and steroids and growth hormone you
01:56:40.719 never know they might keep that
01:56:41.760 [ __ ] around for a long time how
01:56:43.599 joseph kennedy made his fortune hint it
01:56:45.679 was bootlegging no this just wasn't
01:56:47.440 bootlegging oh it wasn't oh i can't see
01:56:49.599 the end because of the white shirt
01:56:51.520 according to the biographer that is a
01:56:54.000 rumor that started in the 60s and 70s
01:56:56.480 when they're trying to figure out who
01:56:57.440 killed jfk and maybe it was them off
01:56:59.840 because they were in that business that
01:57:01.760 sounds like the kennedy family is trying
01:57:03.440 to cover up their dirty tracks
01:57:05.599 it's a rumor the [ __ ] out of here nobody
01:57:08.320 has a rumor about you bootlegging ever
01:57:10.880 no i'm just i was looking because i've
01:57:12.400 heard that too but like
01:57:14.480 right away okay it's like in the stock
01:57:15.920 market
01:57:16.719 that well
01:57:17.760 maybe maybe bootlegging too let's try
01:57:20.480 another source let's see
01:57:22.840 uh joseph kennedy was a bootlegger
01:57:26.080 type that in
01:57:27.280 what well
01:57:28.639 that story is going to come here the
01:57:29.920 daily beast the myth of jos joe
01:57:31.440 kennedy's no so it is a myth i don't
01:57:33.599 know where i would find the correct
01:57:35.119 story to you know i know right like how
01:57:37.280 do you know who's telling the truth and
01:57:38.639 whether or not it's a
01:57:40.000 this big old historical cover-up
01:57:42.239 like if you were bootlegging how much
01:57:43.760 information would there be about you
01:57:45.360 being a bootlegger unless you got
01:57:47.040 arrested for it
01:57:48.480 for me i think cops were probably in on
01:57:50.480 bootlegging back then don't you think
01:57:52.000 everybody that could make money was
01:57:53.760 involved with sure everybody what is my
01:57:55.760 piece
01:57:57.280 you probably they probably were angry
01:57:58.960 that the bars were closed too yeah and
01:58:00.639 then they wanted a couple bottles give
01:58:01.840 me a cup of bottle come on so you can do
01:58:04.000 whatever you want to do do you imagine
01:58:05.280 if that's how we lived right now if
01:58:06.800 booze was illegal
01:58:09.119 imagine as much as people drink if you
01:58:10.880 had to do it all
01:58:12.320 secret you had to like have a big dude
01:58:14.480 by the door you'd have a password to get
01:58:16.400 in you're always worried about getting
01:58:17.840 raided by the cops just so you could
01:58:19.599 have a drink but people would do it they
01:58:21.440 did it they did it for years they made
01:58:23.280 organized crime that's where like al
01:58:25.199 capone made all of his money that's
01:58:27.199 that's yeah that's the argument that's
01:58:28.719 going on right now with um
01:58:31.440 with the mexican cartels like the reason
01:58:34.000 why they're able to make so much money
01:58:35.840 is because all that stuff's illegal and
01:58:37.679 they're consuming it in the united
01:58:39.119 states so you're playing a stupid game
01:58:41.440 you're pretending people aren't taking
01:58:42.960 it when they are you're making it
01:58:44.480 illegal because you said they shouldn't
01:58:45.920 do it but you want to control it you're
01:58:48.239 just empowering organized crime and
01:58:50.480 that's what they did with organized
01:58:51.840 crime in chicago that's what they did
01:58:53.760 with organized crime in a lot of areas
01:58:55.360 of this country where they had that's
01:58:56.480 why they probably want to position
01:58:57.760 people that they had influence over to
01:58:59.760 be
01:59:00.400 politicians for sure they had so much
01:59:02.320 money and back then there was no
01:59:03.520 internet nobody knew what was in your
01:59:04.800 bank account where it came bro shut that

01:59:56.800 i don't know
01:59:58.480 do you remember jamie
01:59:59.920 oh kennedy's being a bootlegger oh yeah
02:00:02.719 maybe you were i might be full [ __ ] uh
02:00:05.199 but we didn't know you for sure
02:00:06.880 validated the story but it was like
02:00:08.159 there was just a rumor you know how it
02:00:09.440 started right for sure there's a lot of
02:00:11.040 organized crime money in [ __ ]
02:00:12.239 bootlegging that's a fact i'm on
02:00:14.719 antibiotics because i got shot
02:00:17.760 yeah you can't drink for how long
02:00:20.320 like three more days son refreshing
02:00:22.560 though give your body a little bit of a
02:00:23.760 break it is but i'm it is that's it
02:00:27.199 you're looking forward no no not missing
02:00:28.719 it you know what i'm saying like after a
02:00:30.159 show a little shot right
02:00:32.400 well you know i just got this for all
02:00:34.400 the people that's been in the streets
02:00:35.520 and got shot got to get better are you
02:00:38.159 um
02:00:39.040 nervous for the country right now are
02:00:40.719 you nervous about the future
02:00:42.800 no
02:00:43.760 not at all
02:00:45.040 no
02:00:46.239 i believe that we always going to find
02:00:48.320 solutions to stuff like the first thing
02:00:50.480 like you mentioned about people that
02:00:51.599 need to work or whatever the first thing
02:00:53.599 that's going to happen is there's going
02:00:54.800 to be some type of stimulus package
02:00:56.560 approved
02:00:57.760 [ __ ] is going to feel somewhat
02:00:59.679 security or a little better if they have
02:01:02.080 some money to be able to do something
02:01:04.320 but this is just something that
02:01:06.400 this is just something that we're going
02:01:08.639 to get past it's just a
02:01:11.119 it's a matter of time and with the
02:01:13.440 vaccine being on board
02:01:15.199 with them having more ways to test
02:01:17.360 somebody in a faster manner
02:01:20.000 they don't cost as much
02:01:21.679 i think it's going to change people's
02:01:23.119 attitude the way they feel about certain
02:01:24.800 things and things that start turning
02:01:26.880 around i hope you're right um my concern
02:01:29.840 really is about how how hard it's going
02:01:31.280 to be to turn around the economy with
02:01:32.880 that many people out of work
02:01:34.719 that's what my my worry is so many
02:01:37.040 people are going to be broke and so many
02:01:38.560 people are going to lose their houses so
02:01:40.080 many people are going to get evicted
02:01:42.400 i just don't know how they stop that and
02:01:44.400 turn that around when all these jobs are
02:01:46.560 gone because all these businesses went
02:01:48.159 under that's what scares me it's like
02:01:50.239 that this wasn't anticipated that i
02:01:52.639 think there would have been another way
02:01:53.760 to do it
02:01:54.960 you know they certainly didn't lock down
02:01:56.960 as much out here not nearly as much and
02:01:59.280 then that's a good point because i mean
02:02:01.199 like whatever you worked for whatever
02:02:03.360 just could be pulled from under you just
02:02:04.880 like that's the thing about like you
02:02:06.480 can't say that the people that are upset
02:02:08.320 today are soy boys
02:02:10.239 they can't say that they're all [ __ ]
02:02:11.599 because there's a lot of people that are
02:02:12.800 upset through no fault of their own they
02:02:14.639 lost everything right you could be the
02:02:16.239 most disciplined guy in the world you
02:02:17.920 get up early every day you work hard all
02:02:19.679 day you you build a business and then
02:02:21.440 all of a sudden
02:02:22.639 kovid comes around and you know you find
02:02:24.800 out your margins are a lot smaller than
02:02:26.239 you thought well nobody expected it to
02:02:28.239 go eight nine months right so you're not
02:02:29.599 making any money for eight nine months
02:02:31.040 and you can't reopen
02:02:32.880 there's a lot of businesses like that
02:02:34.239 there's a lot of bars
02:02:36.960 there's not enough bailouts there's so
02:02:38.800 many businesses there's not enough and
02:02:40.719 they're not going to give it to all
02:02:41.840 they're not going to give you all you
02:02:42.880 lost you're going to lose a tremendous
02:02:44.560 amount no matter what well there was a
02:02:46.080 lot of people getting that money that
02:02:47.119 was [ __ ] but it was so much goddamn
02:02:49.599 [ __ ] scandal with them
02:02:51.360 pba loans and [ __ ] man everybody was
02:02:54.320 grabbing them [ __ ]
02:02:55.840 you know they'll find money then you got
02:02:57.520 to pay it back
02:02:59.760 i hope
02:03:01.360 we figure out a way to
02:03:03.360 make this uh
02:03:05.040 make this economy bounce back and but i
02:03:06.960 say we when i say we i mean people way
02:03:08.960 smarter than me
02:03:10.320 i hope i hope somebody figures it out
02:03:13.520 about my son had the best life he can
02:03:15.119 have
02:03:15.840 yeah well i hope so too you know what
02:03:17.520 i'm saying like i think that
02:03:20.400 it's gonna get we're gonna just start
02:03:21.599 people gonna be concerned about people
02:03:23.119 close to them and their family
02:03:24.880 and how that situation is going
02:03:27.119 yeah i mean everybody hopes that the
02:03:29.920 next person that gets in office is gonna
02:03:31.760 nail it
02:03:32.960 everybody hopes the next person that
02:03:34.320 gets an office is gonna fix all our
02:03:35.840 problems
02:03:37.599 we gotta change the way we communicate
02:03:39.360 with each other that's a big that's a
02:03:41.199 big one everybody's locked in this trap
02:03:43.760 of uh us versus them
02:03:46.320 of red versus blue of like what whatever
02:03:49.599 the the trap is like
02:03:51.679 whatever your particular trap is
02:03:54.480 there's men versus women traps there's
02:03:56.639 people get crazy with being tribal and
02:03:59.440 being on a [ __ ] team
02:04:01.119 we're supposed to be one team supposed
02:04:03.280 to be united states of america if we
02:04:05.280 differ on small things like immigration
02:04:08.800 or
02:04:11.280 things like
02:04:13.119 financial issues or how to use uh taxes
02:04:17.520 and
02:04:19.040 the most important thing is that we all
02:04:21.440 want what's best for the country we all
02:04:23.520 want the country to do well you want to
02:04:24.800 thank people you want to that's the
02:04:27.040 that's how you want people to feel
02:04:29.199 that's what drove me the most crazy
02:04:30.639 about trump being president i felt like
02:04:32.000 it was the first time i could ever
02:04:33.280 remember where people wanted things to
02:04:35.840 be bad
02:04:37.199 so that he would be a bad president so
02:04:39.440 that i mean i guess they probably did
02:04:40.960 with obama too
02:04:42.560 they wanted things to go bad so they
02:04:44.400 could blame it on him like they would
02:04:45.920 rather
02:04:46.880 have something to blame on him
02:04:49.599 than to have everything go well like if
02:04:51.360 you asked a hardcore trump hater would
02:04:53.679 you rather this would be a good question
02:04:56.000 would you rather the economy become the
02:04:58.480 greatest economy the world has ever
02:05:00.320 known and you'd be totally wrong and
02:05:02.719 trump even though he's a [ __ ] grabber
02:05:04.960 and he's full of [ __ ] and he brags about
02:05:06.880 himself
02:05:07.920 became literally the best person to make
02:05:11.520 the decisions that were the best for the
02:05:13.360 country
02:05:14.480 or
02:05:15.440 would you rather the economy fall to the
02:05:17.520 toilet and trump goes to jail like trump
02:05:19.360 goes to jail yeah
02:05:21.119 yeah there's no party yeah i know
02:05:23.920 he would immediately there would be no
02:05:26.000 hesitation put him in jail [ __ ] him
02:05:28.159 everything's fine
02:05:29.840 everything's fine
02:05:31.360 that sounds like a relationship
02:05:33.520 whatever makes you happy you like [ __ ]
02:05:35.440 that i don't want it to be happy well
02:05:36.800 they definitely didn't want him to do
02:05:38.639 well which is weird like they wanted him
02:05:40.719 to get arrested and then the economy to
02:05:42.079 bounce back that's what part of they but
02:05:44.079 another thing they wanted to joe they
02:05:45.440 wanted um
02:05:46.639 to feel like uh you cared about them
02:05:49.280 they wanted to feel like you cared about
02:05:51.920 something or somebody else other than
02:05:54.000 your fan base
02:05:55.440 that was a big part of it man people
02:05:57.199 didn't
02:05:58.079 i don't think people were just looking
02:05:59.520 for reasons to hate on him and i know
02:06:01.280 some people that like
02:06:03.440 liked him
02:06:05.760 some people love it some people love to
02:06:07.360 know nothing since [ __ ] it people love a
02:06:09.199 guy who came along and said [ __ ] you the
02:06:11.280 politically correct [ __ ] too there's a
02:06:13.599 lot that people liked about him people
02:06:15.599 liked the idea that he got [ __ ] over
02:06:17.440 in this election too they liked the idea
02:06:19.599 that the deep state was involved and
02:06:21.920 that people were rigging voting machines
02:06:24.320 and miscounting votes and people loved
02:06:26.480 those stories i do not know if those
02:06:28.400 stories are true i don't give a [ __ ]
02:06:30.159 about those stories
02:06:31.599 they're a bummer though it's a bummer
02:06:33.199 that there's those stories this would be
02:06:34.800 the ideal scenario whoever won one if
02:06:37.760 it's biden and comma they win and then
02:06:41.119 that's it the transfer of power shake of
02:06:43.360 hands people do what they've always done
02:06:45.599 with obama do whatever you don't want to
02:06:47.040 do that son they don't want to do that
02:06:48.639 that's so corny you don't want to shake
02:06:50.320 him up okay you don't want to give him
02:06:51.520 the secrets you don't give up the keys
02:06:53.679 he's got it give up the cards he's got
02:06:55.840 to do it especially if he wants to run
02:06:57.599 again see if trump wants to do it again
02:06:59.360 he could run one more time in 2024 but
02:07:01.920 the only way he's going to be able to do
02:07:03.679 that he's got to be able to sit down and
02:07:06.159 shake biden's hand and say i'll see you
02:07:08.400 in four years [ __ ] he's got to be you
02:07:10.719 can't said that you can't just keep
02:07:12.320 saying that the voting is a hundred
02:07:14.880 percent rigged and i won this election
02:07:16.800 by a lot and
02:07:18.320 all that's [ __ ] dangerous because
02:07:19.920 it's just dangerous for our confidence
02:07:21.679 it's dangerous yeah people talking about
02:07:22.960 rise up you're gonna it's gonna be
02:07:24.400 something something's going to do don't
02:07:26.079 say that here's the thing i
02:07:28.560 you got to show the evidence first
02:07:31.280 you got to show the evidence first
02:07:32.880 there's just to be like you have to
02:07:34.079 compile all that evidence if there
02:07:36.079 really is that evidence you got to
02:07:37.920 compile it all and present it in a very
02:07:40.560 solid way shut down
02:07:42.880 yeah
02:07:44.079 it's um
02:07:45.520 it's not i mean it's above our pay grade
02:07:47.280 dc even understand
02:07:49.679 national politics on that scale but i
02:07:51.840 think that as a country i think you and
02:07:53.760 i both know
02:07:55.280 that this country's
02:07:56.880 this is like it's never been a position
02:07:59.040 where you don't know what the hell is
02:07:59.920 going to happen you never know like with
02:08:02.159 you never know
02:08:03.760 there's there's so much turmoil and
02:08:06.159 weirdness and you never know what is
02:08:07.840 there going to be another wave of this
02:08:09.199 pandemic are they going to shut
02:08:10.320 everything down again whatever what
02:08:11.599 happens then whatever happened then we
02:08:13.440 go with what has become our new norm
02:08:16.560 we go back to that you know i'm saying
02:08:18.320 like things are about to shift by the
02:08:20.159 spring or the summer this is going to be
02:08:22.000 in a totally different place
02:08:23.840 in regard to how people feel about
02:08:26.639 being in public
02:08:28.400 again they're going to have this they're
02:08:30.079 going to come up with some super rapid
02:08:31.840 testing situation i hope that's going to
02:08:34.079 make the [ __ ] um essential workers
02:08:36.400 people in medical field feel more
02:08:38.560 comfortable they're going to make other
02:08:40.079 people feel comfortable
02:08:41.599 and eventually like
02:08:43.920 people are going to
02:08:45.440 make decisions am i going to [ __ ]
02:08:46.880 hope so what am i going to do
02:08:48.560 to live i hope the vaccine and you know
02:08:51.840 that the election gets resolved quickly
02:08:54.639 jamie if you had a guess if you would no
02:08:56.639 i know but i mean let them let trump say
02:08:59.199 its result
02:09:00.480 if you had a guess what percentage
02:09:03.520 of uh election fraud do you think there
02:09:06.079 was
02:09:07.199 take a guess
02:09:08.560 it's not zero right
02:09:10.239 probably not zero but it's like one two
02:09:12.400 percent like the normal polled i think
02:09:14.719 it's really one percent that's a lot i
02:09:16.719 mean there's 150 million votes i don't
02:09:18.480 think it's i don't think it's
02:09:19.840 a lot i don't think it's one but i think
02:09:21.520 it's
02:09:22.560 i think there's a some
02:09:24.320 less than zero number
02:09:26.639 or some more than zero number rather
02:09:28.560 that is uh voter fraud i think that any
02:09:30.960 reasonable person point one of points
02:09:33.040 yeah it's not
02:09:34.480 and who knows which way it goes because
02:09:35.840 i bet there's voter fraud the other way
02:09:37.199 too
02:09:38.079 we're not hearing about that because
02:09:39.199 biden won
02:09:40.719 but
02:09:41.679 if biden was like trump and he lost that
02:09:44.639 race who knows he might they might try
02:09:46.719 to figure out a way that the republicans
02:09:48.159 cheated
02:09:49.119 i don't know man
02:09:50.719 yo i'm gonna tell you this [ __ ] has
02:09:52.560 turned into comedy son
02:09:54.639 what's turned into comedy this whole
02:09:56.639 just not quitting just it's kind of
02:09:58.480 crazy no it's every day it's tweeting no
02:10:00.880 it's not even crazy it's entertaining
02:10:04.320 it's entertaining i know it's
02:10:05.840 unfortunate for me entertainment but
02:10:08.000 it's entertaining i get that it's
02:10:09.760 entertaining but it makes me nervous
02:10:13.119 it makes me nervous when you start
02:10:14.960 thinking that there's people out there
02:10:16.239 that think that um
02:10:18.239 that there's been a coup right or that
02:10:20.719 trump is attempting a coup there's like
02:10:22.239 two different schools of thought one
02:10:23.920 school of thought is the deep state took
02:10:25.440 over the election and they they they
02:10:27.280 rigged it and the other school of
02:10:28.320 thought is this guy is trying to win
02:10:30.239 even though he lost
02:10:31.679 and he's trying to figure out a way to
02:10:34.079 sue his way back into the white house
02:10:36.159 and this is crazy
02:10:37.679 so this is good yeah so there's uh
02:10:40.560 that's the problem is that there's not
02:10:41.920 enough he's gonna win
02:10:43.599 one end because
02:10:44.960 he's got the power of the people like
02:10:46.800 again those of him losing
02:10:49.440 the support that he has he knows that
02:10:51.440 there's a community he can they're gonna
02:10:53.840 be [ __ ] still on his dick right now
02:10:55.679 because
02:10:56.560 he can shake some [ __ ] up yeah i said
02:10:58.960 [ __ ] him [ __ ] all of them
02:11:01.840 am i ever going to get some help do you
02:11:03.360 have any help today
02:11:04.960 i have it at my house yeah
02:11:07.040 you can't cook it though right i can
02:11:08.560 cook it we have to figure out how much
02:11:10.400 time we have between now and the show
02:11:12.719 yo
02:11:13.679 you can bring some elk to the show son
02:11:15.440 not enough for everybody no just a
02:11:17.199 sample yeah why don't you just come over
02:11:18.880 my house i'll cook for you
02:11:20.400 what time do we have i don't know we'll
02:11:22.000 figure it out when we get out of here
02:11:23.119 let's figure it out off the air though
02:11:25.599 but my two lesbian friends are supposed
02:11:27.280 to meet me son
02:11:30.239 they're not like
02:11:31.599 no like no menage a troia lesbians she's
02:11:33.920 like regular lesbians they're my friends
02:11:35.599 okay that's cool
02:11:37.119 yeah
02:11:38.400 who do they think won
02:11:40.400 biden
02:11:41.840 what
02:11:43.119 hell man what i said my two lesbian
02:11:45.520 friends
02:11:47.040 lesbians adopted mexican son eli who i
02:11:50.239 [ __ ] love you don't think there's
02:11:51.760 lesbians for trump i bet there's a whole
02:11:53.119 website i don't you know what i never
02:11:55.119 thought about that i don't think it's
02:11:56.000 too many lesbians for trump i bet
02:11:58.000 there's a few i bet they get together
02:11:59.679 and like yeah you know like people i
02:12:01.360 don't know
02:12:02.400 i don't think that that's never that's
02:12:04.000 what i never thought about you know
02:12:05.760 that's what's for trump some people are
02:12:07.440 really into anime there's a t-shirt
02:12:09.199 there goes lesbian for trouble oh no
02:12:11.670 [Laughter]
02:12:15.760 it's funny but you would assume that if
02:12:17.840 someone's a lesbian that's what i was
02:12:19.199 kind of getting at that you would
02:12:20.560 instantly know who they're voting for
02:12:22.639 right i mean i know that's kind of
02:12:24.159 profound but i was definitely like a
02:12:25.679 short haircut
02:12:27.040 you know short haircut [ __ ] man cut
02:12:29.199 out suit with the tie right like how
02:12:31.280 many girls with blue hair or pink hair
02:12:33.520 voted for trump is it less than zero
02:12:36.719 that's a good stat
02:12:38.239 yeah
02:12:40.239 trump pride gay republicans on why
02:12:42.560 they're backing the president
02:12:46.159 because they get to dress up again again
02:12:47.840 have a good time it's a cool outfit
02:12:50.880 it's uh such a weird time man such a
02:12:53.440 weird time
02:12:54.960 but i'm ready to just get on the river
02:12:56.560 bro i get it i'm ready nature into some
02:12:58.880 nature do you think you're gonna move
02:13:00.320 there would you move there i think so
02:13:02.639 it's a good place to be
02:13:04.400 i think the community i mean it's just
02:13:05.920 like just such a community man this
02:13:08.159 summer
02:13:09.199 and it was just so simple would you um
02:13:12.480 would you get rid of your place in la
02:13:14.239 and just settle down there yeah i could
02:13:15.599 do that i could do
02:13:17.520 i could do it better for travel really
02:13:19.840 if you wanted to go left or right you're
02:13:21.520 more closer to the middle for everything
02:13:23.599 man
02:13:24.480 i just want to be around some trees
02:13:27.520 i think that's one good thing about
02:13:29.119 people that can escape from la there's a
02:13:31.280 lot of people that are escaping from new
02:13:32.960 york as well and they're moving to the
02:13:34.800 the suburbs and they're they're liking
02:13:36.560 it better they're more relaxed or get
02:13:39.119 some space people who are like instead
02:13:41.280 of being in the chaos yeah i can drive
02:13:44.000 to the chaos yeah you know it's like
02:13:46.079 [ __ ] people from we're not even drive
02:13:48.000 now a lot of people are working from
02:13:49.280 home
02:13:50.880 so you don't think it's going to change
02:13:52.320 i think there's going to be a lot of
02:13:53.599 companies that realize like hey i don't
02:13:55.199 need this gigantic space
02:13:57.679 to handle all these people i can let
02:13:59.199 people work from home they're more
02:14:00.400 productive because a lot of times people
02:14:02.480 in offices they get together they talk
02:14:04.639 they have fun you know there's a lot of
02:14:06.719 work
02:14:07.440 oh man i used to [ __ ] be in the
02:14:09.040 [ __ ] break room i never was doing
02:14:10.800 work
02:14:11.679 always in the breakdown i've seen dudes
02:14:13.360 in cubicles doing this [ __ ] whether the
02:14:15.040 cubicle's here and they're both on the
02:14:16.719 outside they're just having a
02:14:17.679 conversation they're nowhere near their
02:14:19.199 computer people do that all the time if
02:14:21.920 no one's watching people do that all the
02:14:24.079 time in some jobs don't get it don't get
02:14:26.560 personal if it's you
02:14:28.000 back from the cubicle that's hilarious
02:14:29.599 there's a lot of dudes that are working
02:14:31.440 all over the place that
02:14:33.520 would be more productive if they just
02:14:35.520 had a certain amount of work to do and
02:14:36.800 they could just get it done at home
02:14:38.880 you know but sometimes they want to
02:14:40.480 patrol i think it's a good idea there's
02:14:42.239 a lot of people that have jobs you have
02:14:43.920 to be there right auto mechanic a lot of
02:14:46.239 people
02:14:47.280 fill in the blank carpenter a lot of
02:14:49.440 people have jobs got to be there but
02:14:50.960 there's certain jobs
02:14:52.560 like why do you need yeah why do you
02:14:54.480 need to sit through an hour and 15
02:14:56.079 minutes of traffic when you can just do
02:14:57.760 it through zoom and just sit here in a
02:15:00.239 pair of shorts and a t-shirt and get all
02:15:01.599 your [ __ ] work done like what why do
02:15:03.520 you why do you need to go somewhere you
02:15:05.440 don't with computers today you don't
02:15:07.280 have to go anywhere you don't have to go
02:15:08.159 anywhere they just want to control the
02:15:09.440 movements of it they just want to
02:15:12.079 it's it makes sense and i think it's
02:15:13.520 going to go to that everybody's like i'm
02:15:15.280 working from home i'm working from home
02:15:16.400 and they're getting getting the job done
02:15:18.079 yeah everything is different a lot of
02:15:20.239 people are going to be able to stay home
02:15:22.800 and so i think that's just going to
02:15:23.920 change the nature of cities in general
02:15:25.599 less people are going to have to commute
02:15:27.440 to them
02:15:28.560 but that's one
02:15:30.320 probably good thing about this
02:15:33.760 is that people are going to not have to
02:15:35.840 commute as much so maybe the roads won't
02:15:37.360 be as jammed up
02:15:39.040 if that that saves people so much
02:15:41.840 [ __ ] stress if you're a dude who
02:15:44.239 works in orange county and you live in
02:15:45.760 l.a and you got to make that drive every
02:15:47.280 morning you ever see that [ __ ] drive
02:15:49.520 that's right i'm not driving insane i've
02:15:51.440 come from that job i've been going the
02:15:53.440 other way of that drive when you go
02:15:54.960 orange county to l.a at 7 00 am you want
02:15:57.679 to just [ __ ] end it
02:16:00.079 you just you just like i can't do this
02:16:01.599 every day but you can do it for a minute
02:16:03.440 because that's the route that i because
02:16:05.199 i um
02:16:06.400 my account is out in orange county
02:16:08.639 and i did that trip a couple times and i
02:16:10.320 kind of enjoyed being up in the in the
02:16:11.920 morning with it
02:16:13.520 because i don't have to do i didn't do
02:16:14.480 it because you don't have to do it every
02:16:15.760 day if you had a job and you had to be
02:16:17.760 at your job at 8 30 in the morning every
02:16:19.440 day and you live in orange county you
02:16:20.960 got to go to l.a you got to leave your

02:22:22.880 that
02:22:24.319 planning for your future is a good thing
02:22:26.640 it's a necessary thing even even though
02:22:28.960 it's uncertain you have to remember the
02:22:31.280 sun does rise every morning
02:22:33.760 yeah so just keep moving and people that
02:22:38.080 are in this [ __ ] right now never thought
02:22:40.000 that it was going to happen now that
02:22:41.200 they know that this is a possibility now
02:22:42.880 we have to plan for the future for the
02:22:44.800 future yeah i've never seen this before
02:22:46.800 never you know you've never seen
02:22:48.240 something as large as the american
02:22:49.840 economy stop and then start back up but
02:22:53.040 it's a global phenomenon it's like it's
02:22:54.800 it's not like it's just happening to us
02:22:56.640 we're just handling it terribly i like
02:22:58.479 how you handle it though i like doing
02:23:00.080 those shows that you did in yellow
02:23:01.680 springs it's a great idea it was
02:23:03.359 wonderful we did it in that chapel that
02:23:06.000 whole area outside yeah there's a
02:23:07.600 brazilian all outdoors i talked to my
02:23:09.520 doctor my family practitioner and he
02:23:12.319 told me you should play outdoors
02:23:14.240 if you play indoors use uv air filters
02:23:16.319 you know like the specs of a building
02:23:17.840 that might be safer many buildings now
02:23:19.920 today are not outfitted this way
02:23:22.000 and and
02:23:23.359 you know you hope for the best you take
02:23:24.960 every necessary precaution reasonable
02:23:27.760 precaution and and but it's a pandemic
02:23:30.560 there's no guarantees
02:23:32.720 are you getting any people giving you
02:23:34.240 [ __ ] about doing shows
02:23:36.080 no
02:23:36.880 no nothing i mean even if i did you know
02:23:39.200 what i mean who cares

02:25:15.680 she's scared of cold like why is she
02:25:17.600 shaking she might be a little
02:25:19.040 combination of both
02:25:21.600 she maybe she needs a drink maybe she
02:25:23.359 has to piss
02:25:24.560 she's five months old how is she keeping
02:25:26.240 it together
02:25:27.520 don't talk about her like that she's

02:26:25.840 and uh one kind of like this what they
02:26:27.840 call it a chowini i think they call it
02:26:30.160 it's half chihuahua half one of those
02:26:32.000 hot dogs that's the one baba remember
02:26:34.000 the one in my special baba
02:26:35.920 that's him that's your weenie
02:26:37.920 you have this and i have my dog and then
02:26:40.080 uh my my daughter has a little uh a
02:26:42.880 little dog like this not a not a
02:26:44.399 chihuahua i can't remember what kind of
02:26:45.520 dog she is
02:26:46.880 my daughter has a chihuahua
02:26:48.800 mix it's like a chihuahua with like i
02:26:51.120 think he's got some whippet or something
02:26:52.800 in him so he's a chihuahua with long
02:26:54.319 legs
02:26:55.200 he's adorable
02:26:57.760 you know i always wanted i wanted my
02:26:59.040 kids to train animals when they were
02:27:00.479 little really that's one of these things
02:27:02.240 i should have followed through but the
02:27:03.760 reason i did it is because i wanted to
02:27:05.439 learn how to be patient with other with
02:27:08.080 people
02:27:09.439 and i figured
02:27:11.040 if they train the dog or something it
02:27:14.000 takes patience look this dog is adorable
02:27:16.560 but she don't know nothing yet yeah she
02:27:18.560 don't know [ __ ]
02:27:20.240 she knows snacks the real problem is
02:27:21.840 when you get dogs that need a lot of
02:27:23.200 training like if you want to have a
02:27:24.560 german shepherd or a working dog like a
02:27:27.200 belgian malinois a lot of people get
02:27:28.640 those dogs you don't realize like you
02:27:30.399 you basically got like a little genius
02:27:32.319 with teeth that lives with you that
02:27:34.160 wants to figure figure out problems you
02:27:36.399 know those like uh have you heard of
02:27:38.160 those celebrity
02:27:39.680 like the german shepherds the guard dogs
02:27:41.439 the real ones with that no 200 commands
02:27:44.319 yeah
02:27:45.200 schutzen training yeah yeah yeah yeah
02:27:48.560 i've seen guys do that some comedians
02:27:51.520 got one of those dogs spent like 200
02:27:53.600 grand on it and it died in like
02:27:55.920 a week
02:27:58.560 those are crazy if you can have a dog
02:28:00.080 like that that's a commitment man
02:28:02.319 like those dogs need work that's what
02:28:04.240 i'm saying
02:28:05.439 german and [ __ ] those dogs are so smart
02:28:08.319 they're from a long history of working
02:28:10.240 dogs those are task oriented dogs this
02:28:13.439 dog's
02:28:14.560 a long history of
02:28:16.800 something is she adorable
02:28:18.640 come on maggie she is come here
02:28:22.720 she doesn't want to be held back bro
02:28:24.640 have you ever taken a dog hunting
02:28:26.800 no you can't do that right now not my
02:28:28.800 dog it's too dangerous well
02:28:31.280 you wouldn't want him to be in the woods
02:28:33.359 first of all could probably scare off
02:28:34.640 the animals but second of all he has
02:28:36.479 like the instincts that chase squirrels
02:28:38.399 and [ __ ] he chases squirrels but he's
02:28:40.399 like a he's a lover
02:28:43.359 he's not he's there's no aggression in
02:28:45.439 him like with other dogs like he's

02:33:08.640 how did you learn to cook
02:33:10.560 just watching my mother cook just
02:33:13.200 watching cooking shows but i do remember
02:33:15.600 when i was younger my mother was a part
02:33:17.600 of publishers clearinghouse and i think
02:33:19.120 they had like one promotion where you
02:33:20.560 get a betty crocker's recipe book and it
02:33:23.920 had all these recipe cards
02:33:26.160 and it just send it to you and it's like
02:33:27.680 like meats and then you see all these
02:33:29.120 recipes
02:33:30.160 and i used to look at the recipe i was
02:33:31.439 like man
02:33:32.800 we got [ __ ] to make none of this with
02:33:36.800 we had the recipe we didn't have the
02:33:38.080 ingredients
02:33:39.760 so i just started reading those recipe
02:33:41.760 because when i got older i was like i
02:33:43.040 should start just [ __ ] with this [ __ ]
02:33:44.399 i couldn't cook
02:33:45.680 and then i just started [ __ ] around
02:33:47.200 and just started having fun with you go
02:33:49.120 off recipes now or do you have it in
02:33:50.560 your head
02:33:51.520 i go off of it 100 percent yeah you know
02:33:54.000 what i'm saying it's like you know what
02:33:55.600 cooking it's like a technique the art of
02:33:58.560 cooking like a order cooking you know
02:34:00.800 how to cook you could cook whatever it
02:34:02.240 just all depends on what spices or
02:34:04.720 whatever but if you're not a cook you're
02:34:06.000 not a cook what's a specialty
02:34:07.920 i don't really have a specialty really
02:34:10.720 i don't have a specialty i'll follow a
02:34:12.160 recipe somebody will do something i'll
02:34:13.600 get inspired by something but i do know
02:34:16.240 i make these garlic noodles right it's
02:34:18.640 not a specialty but
02:34:20.319 it's a whopper it's like a wet ass [ __ ]
02:34:22.640 just it's a wet ass [ __ ]
02:34:25.280 dish son

02:34:41.280 i yeah i probably i love this thing you
02:34:43.280 said the metaphor we had the recipes
02:34:45.600 just not the ingredients that's a good
02:34:47.600 metaphor for like a lot of things in
02:34:49.600 life we had the recipes
02:34:51.680 but none of the ingredients
02:34:53.359 we didn't have it

02:36:27.200 they say in the streets what's all this
02:36:28.560 fuss is about
02:36:30.399 i want some elk son
02:36:32.800 yo everywhere i go [ __ ] say did
02:36:35.040 you try the elk that's all i know what
02:36:37.040 is that is it gamey no it's not gamey
02:36:39.520 it's not like there's a weird taste that
02:36:41.359 people associate with like venison a
02:36:43.600 gamey taste and for the most part it's
02:36:46.319 either hasn't been prepared correctly or
02:36:48.960 it wasn't taken care of correctly after
02:36:51.120 the animal died like that's for the most
02:36:53.439 part with the game it's a different
02:36:55.200 flavor
02:36:56.160 but i think what people associate with
02:36:58.080 with not tasting good like mmm
02:37:00.560 i think a lot of that a lot of it not
02:37:02.640 all of it but a lot of it isn't just
02:37:03.920 personal taste it's bad preparation
02:37:06.880 you get a steak from a grocery store
02:37:09.200 you're assuming that professional
02:37:10.880 butchers like people to grow the cows
02:37:12.960 professional butchers all down the line
02:37:14.720 they get the steak if you've got a guy's
02:37:17.120 dear me who knows how this guy took care
02:37:19.280 of that [ __ ] deer you know he could
02:37:21.040 have had that [ __ ]
02:37:22.640 [ __ ] nowhere no marvelous ain't no
02:37:24.479 marblization in there nowhere sometimes
02:37:26.640 people uh you know sometimes people
02:37:28.880 shoot them and
02:37:41.920 this is a good elk day right here so it
02:37:44.240 is a good outcome look wait let's what
02:37:45.840 does the captain say watch he mention
02:37:47.439 something about a jalapeno somewhere
02:37:49.280 this is the final product oh [ __ ] that's
02:37:51.760 pretty right but what's that a dry rub
02:37:53.600 what rub is that that's a saskatchewan
02:37:56.960 blackened saskatchewan it's a traeger
02:37:58.880 rub it's like uh like a cajun style
02:38:01.520 almost but it's got it's always like a
02:38:04.399 blackened but not like it's like a lot
02:38:06.720 of salt too
02:38:07.760 delicious it's the perfect rub i love
02:38:09.840 that rub for for elk so wait when you
02:38:12.160 cook it you like you cut it up yourself
02:38:15.120 you know how to cut steaks out of this
02:38:17.200 yes that's the whole part that part is
02:38:19.760 easy because that part is uh what's
02:38:21.200 called the back strap that's the big
02:38:23.040 thick piece of meat that's on each side
02:38:25.040 of the spine look at the knife though
02:38:27.040 [ __ ] what kind of is that a japanese no
02:38:29.359 that's an american knife who made that
02:38:30.880 knife what is it does it say in the
02:38:32.319 caption
02:38:33.280 it doesn't there's no tag or nothing the
02:38:35.120 dude who uh made it was
02:38:37.200 [ __ ] dave you wouldn't even watch you
02:38:39.280 wouldn't eat that it's in there
02:38:40.160 somewhere same knife real close to it so
02:38:42.000 if you're killing elk
02:38:43.680 how long are you eating that elk you can
02:38:46.000 eat it for a whole year literally a year
02:38:48.080 yeah they're huge yeah same knife here i
02:38:50.399 got it there it is the guy gave me the
02:38:52.399 knife there's it let's see

02:39:14.319 follow it for like
02:39:15.760 a day or two or like a year ago if you

02:39:20.640 okay
02:39:22.399 he do it with a botox yeah but you have
02:39:24.880 to practice a lot man this [ __ ] do with
02:39:26.720 a bow
02:39:27.680 it's not easy
02:39:29.200 but the point is i know exactly where
02:39:31.040 that meat's coming from like that
02:39:33.600 i know the whole chain of command i know
02:39:36.240 everything that's happened from the time
02:39:37.520 that animal got hit until the time i'm
02:39:38.960 cooking it
02:39:40.080 that's interesting
02:39:41.520 you know because yeah it's mind-blowing
02:39:43.439 i get all my meats from strangers yeah
02:39:46.240 most people do yeah you don't think
02:39:48.080 about it

02:40:17.120 bear with this from two miles away
02:40:20.399 couldn't imagine why i would shoot a
02:40:22.560 bear that was two miles

02:40:41.120 mile right it's not yards it's close
02:40:44.240 yeah it's great so they can shoot things
02:40:46.080 they can shoot things at a thousand
02:40:47.439 yards

02:40:50.720 shots at a thousand yards so just think

02:41:17.520 a scope
02:41:18.479 well again this was alaska so you got to
02:41:20.640 think things like guns there are are

02:43:39.520 like thomas not fluently but just
02:43:41.840 casual but no i didn't know that we were
02:43:44.479 in new york when we were shooting chapel
02:43:45.920 show we walk into
02:43:48.240 a deli yeah
02:43:50.720 and you know two korean guys sitting
02:43:52.720 talking to each other
02:43:54.240 danielle turns up you know how he talks
02:43:55.680 he starts coming back but you know
02:43:56.960 starts doing the thing
02:43:58.880 and i thought he was [ __ ] with him
02:44:00.399 i'm like oh come on man i'll do that
02:44:01.600 like i'm so sorry sir and the guy cause
02:44:03.439 the guy looked shocked
02:44:05.840 and then the guy started talking back
02:44:07.520 and they talked to each other for a
02:44:08.960 couple seconds
02:44:10.160 and i'm like i was floored staring at
02:44:12.880 him i couldn't believe it he goes oh
02:44:14.479 they thought
02:44:15.520 he said they thought we were stealing
02:44:17.359 son and i told him
02:44:19.200 that we wasn't still i think he called
02:44:20.399 like a dog-eating [ __ ] in his
02:44:21.840 own language yeah
02:44:24.399 and he was he loved it but he said it
02:44:27.520 you promised me you call him a doggy
02:44:28.880 [ __ ] yeah kasich
02:44:30.640 yeah i
02:44:33.520 he was saying something about you while
02:44:35.040 you were standing there and he didn't
02:44:36.319 know that you could speak korean yeah it
02:44:37.600 was but we were wearing kids
02:44:38.800 conversation me and the guy was engaged
02:44:41.040 in conversation dave thought i was
02:44:42.319 mocking him
02:44:43.439 you know dave thought i was manga but i
02:44:44.960 was really having a conversation with
02:44:46.319 him so dave didn't know he thought i was
02:44:48.080 like [ __ ] like yo you can't talk like
02:44:49.760 that
02:44:50.640 and then i was rocking with him i was
02:44:51.840 like oh [ __ ] those guys were floored i
02:44:54.640 was flawed they're like when they see a
02:44:56.640 black guy going to one of those stores
02:44:58.960 that speak any level of korean they
02:45:01.359 [ __ ] lose it like how often does that
02:45:03.200 happen well clearly this means one could
02:45:05.600 surmise that when you were in the air
02:45:06.880 force you spent a lot of time off base i
02:45:09.040 did you would just be in town and just
02:45:11.520 hanging out i would just go when we had
02:45:13.120 days off i would go to like these little
02:45:15.600 small
02:45:16.479 cities wherever they live just
02:45:18.399 they never
02:45:19.439 experienced americans let alone a black
02:45:21.359 guy and i would catch boats and [ __ ]
02:45:23.279 over there just hang out with them
02:45:25.279 and that's how i got they got accustomed
02:45:28.000 to me and i got accustomed to them can
02:45:29.359 you read it no i couldn't read it but i
02:45:31.200 could back in the day i could spell my
02:45:33.120 name
02:45:34.080 but it was just like i was with
02:45:35.359 trustworthy people you know we all
02:45:37.359 worked together and it was just like
02:45:39.120 [ __ ] can i do man let's go see what your
02:45:41.200 culture is about you know that's cool
02:45:43.279 that you learn that that's a rare thing
02:45:45.680 that's probably a difficult language to
02:45:47.520 pick up too the sounds are so different
02:45:49.359 well to me i think it's a testament that
02:45:51.520 you're a people person
02:45:53.680 which goes back to the original point we
02:45:55.439 all made
02:45:56.399 you find a way if you want to hang out
02:45:57.920 and talk to people and nobody speaks
02:45:59.359 your language i don't speak that
02:46:00.319 language yeah you find a way yeah you
02:46:02.880 will did you learn from books did you
02:46:04.720 take classes
02:46:06.720 at the main gate we worked at maine gate
02:46:08.640 you would have 12 hours 16 hour days so
02:46:11.279 you it's a one american on one side and
02:46:13.279 there's two koreans on the other side
02:46:14.880 you could just stare at each other all
02:46:16.319 day or you could just start doing word
02:46:18.560 association you know i mean it's
02:46:19.920 pointing that stuff
02:46:21.520 down come someday chummy
02:46:28.160 that was the greeting
02:46:29.680 i would say when it comes some that's
02:46:31.040 what they would say come something don't
02:46:32.479 trouble them but i would switch it to me
02:46:34.640 come something i'll tell them roland
02:46:36.000 zimmer don't touch them
02:46:49.200 don't answer phone because i sound like
02:46:50.960 them and then they would say something
02:46:53.279 else i didn't know i was like yeah yeah
02:46:54.479 it comes i'm not telling them
02:46:56.000 touch them up they'd be like oh
02:46:58.960 because your accent was perfect yeah i
02:47:01.200 would do the same like when i started
02:47:02.319 learning spanish i went to ecuador once
02:47:03.840 for like six weeks i just started
02:47:05.520 picking up spanish i had a driver that i
02:47:07.439 i just met the guy i hired him so he
02:47:09.120 would try the car he spoke like a little
02:47:11.359 bit of english
02:47:12.800 and i spoke less spanish but we did the
02:47:15.920 same thing by the end of it by the end
02:47:17.920 of six weeks
02:47:19.040 my man i could speak spanish yeah but i
02:47:21.840 wouldn't mimic i would mimic the action
02:47:24.319 of whoever taught me the word if i
02:47:26.000 learned a word from an argentinian i'd
02:47:27.840 say like an argentinian says it if i
02:47:29.840 that's why when i when i do korean or
02:47:31.680 whatever when i do it even when i do it
02:47:32.960 in my act when it's broken korean
02:47:35.040 people know that's the oddishie he got
02:47:37.279 the tone of an older person a respected
02:47:39.279 person it's oddish oh
02:47:41.920 yeah it's like they know like
02:47:43.920 a real karen could tell who i was around
02:47:46.880 to give my my my accent or however i did
02:47:50.160 it so i have a friend named japanese
02:47:52.240 naki
02:47:53.279 i know japanese naki yeah she she
02:47:56.640 is from tokyo
02:47:58.720 and and for some reason when she was in
02:48:00.800 high school moved to alabama she learned
02:48:03.200 english
02:48:04.640 from alabama people
02:48:06.800 whoa and and which created
02:48:10.240 one of the more hilarious accents i've
02:48:12.640 ever heard in my
02:48:14.960 gotta life i just like where's she got a
02:48:17.680 country she got a country accent wow
02:48:20.479 she's yeah she's and she likes lemon
02:48:22.319 pepper chicken wings it's that kind of
02:48:23.920 stuff yeah in other languages there's
02:48:26.240 all these weird tones that change the
02:48:28.640 meaning of words in korean in particular
02:48:31.279 right in korea in particular because you
02:48:33.120 can tell
02:48:34.240 the way people use their voice when you
02:48:35.760 talk to people older people always talk
02:48:37.200 down to people no matter what you did it
02:48:39.439 don't matter what it is for you to
02:48:40.640 celebrate it it's always like it wasn't
02:48:43.200 enough do you know that those problems
02:48:45.200 in communication is why korean air only
02:48:47.359 teaches pilots in english they only
02:48:49.520 learn and communicate in english they're
02:48:51.439 not allowed to communicate how do you
02:48:53.040 know that well because they started they
02:48:55.040 they recognized there was an issue with
02:48:57.359 the superior
02:48:58.560 and dealing with a superior like if you
02:49:00.720 were my captain and i was your i
02:49:02.560 couldn't say certain things to you if
02:49:03.760 the [ __ ] plane is going to crash i
02:49:05.760 can't simply say you you're doing it the
02:49:08.319 wrong way this is you can't say it but
02:49:10.399 in english you can't so they taught them
02:49:12.880 to communicate in english because it's
02:49:14.800 it changes the way or they only use
02:49:17.600 english because it changes the way you
02:49:19.040 communicate with people you don't have
02:49:20.479 like that cultural classification of the
02:49:23.279 superior of you know an older person who
02:49:25.920 demands respect i get it and that's the
02:49:28.319 one thing people don't understand about
02:49:29.920 especially korean culture
02:49:31.520 is the level of respect that they have
02:49:33.520 yeah that's that people think it's like
02:49:35.439 oh they don't [ __ ] with me because i'm
02:49:36.560 black no the level of respect they have
02:49:39.840 they give a [ __ ] about being older like
02:49:41.840 that's money that's prestige that's
02:49:44.319 everything you being older korean
02:49:45.920 culture was money you know i was around
02:49:48.000 koreans
02:49:49.040 i like this yeah i like this cultural
02:49:51.359 nuance
02:49:52.399 korea is a
02:49:57.439 what they don't have is like
02:50:00.240 like korean dads don't really have
02:50:02.160 connection with their kids like that
02:50:04.240 they don't have like the ultimate
02:50:06.080 emotional oh you did a good job [ __ ]
02:50:08.319 don't they're very hard
02:50:09.840 they're very hard on their kids that's
02:50:11.600 it in general um i had a good friend of
02:50:14.479 mine who was a doctor he was going
02:50:17.359 through his
02:50:18.720 residency while he was on the national
02:50:22.000 taekwondo team and the dude would
02:50:24.399 literally be in school and he would take
02:50:26.399 breaks to put his backpack on he's fill
02:50:28.080 the backpack up with with books and run
02:50:30.560 up staircases and go all the way back
02:50:32.880 down and then go back to
02:50:34.960 go into the library to finish his work
02:50:36.640 oh wow and then he would find a way to
02:50:38.160 go to the gym every day and he won the
02:50:39.520 national championship and there's this
02:50:41.120 korean kid i've never met a person who
02:50:42.880 worked harder in my life to this day i
02:50:45.120 think about that dude he was always
02:50:46.399 tired i go how are you doing man he goes
02:50:48.000 i'm always tired i'm always that
02:50:49.840 [ __ ] every day would be in that
02:50:51.680 gym every day junk sick chang that was
02:50:54.160 his name
02:50:55.200 is he still alive i don't know i haven't
02:50:56.880 talked to him in a long time he was um
02:51:00.560 he's just a guy that uh was like he was
02:51:04.000 probably like the star student of our
02:51:06.160 team
02:51:07.279 during my uh when i was competing
02:51:09.600 because he was this guy that was not
02:51:11.040 just a national champion but also a guy
02:51:12.800 who did it while he was in his [ __ ]
02:51:14.479 medical residency like the amount of
02:51:16.479 work that he was capable of doing was
02:51:18.160 insane and he was like the way koreans
02:51:21.279 are in you know the way he would
02:51:22.479 describe it to me he's like nothing's
02:51:23.840 ever enough no matter what i do it's
02:51:25.680 never perfect like
02:51:27.680 no one no one's here to praise me i
02:51:29.680 gotta keep working hard sounds like a
02:51:31.120 fun guy jesus christ
02:51:34.319 they're younger
02:51:36.800 korean military yeah it's like when you
02:51:39.200 were like when somebody was uh outranked
02:51:42.080 or whatever they used to do this thing
02:51:44.000 called education where they could just
02:51:45.680 talk to a little korean [ __ ] any
02:51:47.600 kind of where they went yeah and they
02:51:49.200 used to have this little
02:51:50.560 greeting they used to do
02:51:52.080 and then you just see the other the
02:51:53.840 young koreans just like
02:51:56.479 like they could do whatever they wanted
02:51:58.240 to this [ __ ] he could not do
02:51:59.439 nothing but just show them yeah you have
02:52:00.880 to take it they used to like there was
02:52:02.880 no rules like if you do this they would
02:52:05.040 [ __ ] beat the [ __ ] up or
02:52:06.880 whatever they came back
02:52:08.960 but there's one thing i like that you
02:52:10.319 described
02:52:11.520 the reverence for older people yeah i
02:52:13.600 feel like here in america we just
02:52:15.279 discard people yeah really quick yeah
02:52:18.240 it's not wise we should get more than
02:52:20.319 half price at the movies that's a
02:52:22.080 certain point yeah come on that's
02:52:24.080 the least they could do
02:52:25.760 well we've we've forgotten that it's
02:52:28.000 important to have people that are older
02:52:29.279 than you that figure life out a little
02:52:30.800 bit better than you have to help lead
02:52:32.479 the way we got guys we're running for
02:52:34.319 president the way they kept going in on
02:52:35.920 joe biden for being old yeah you know
02:52:38.240 trump you know whatever it's whatever so
02:52:40.240 come on man like it's a trumpet
02:52:42.560 that's what i mean
02:52:43.760 i like when trump calls the elderly the
02:52:45.520 elderly
02:52:46.560 as if that somehow doesn't apply to him
02:52:48.960 yo that's how i help y'all dave i did a
02:52:51.840 show once right and i was so caught up
02:52:53.760 in myself i was like
02:52:55.200 look at all these old head [ __ ]
02:52:57.040 that i went to high school with right
02:53:00.319 i was like old ass [ __ ] that
02:53:02.319 i'm their same age i forgot that
02:53:04.960 all together that's real that's real
02:53:07.359 everyone's in
02:53:08.960 they are a the
02:53:09.760 older than me and they're the same age
02:53:12.160 yeah they're the exact same age i'm
02:53:13.680 talking [ __ ]
02:53:15.279 yeah all my all my friends around my age
02:53:18.080 you don't feel it
02:53:20.080 yeah they're more like they they have
02:53:21.680 like you know i mean they dress the part
02:53:23.520 that's why it's very important for older
02:53:25.920 people to actually have their [ __ ]
02:53:27.120 together
02:53:28.080 because when older people actually have
02:53:29.680 their [ __ ] together maybe people will
02:53:31.200 resume the idea of respecting
02:53:33.600 older people like maybe maybe it'll
02:53:35.279 become more of a trend in the future
02:53:37.600 but whenever all the people are that old
02:53:39.680 and they're still crazy when that's a
02:53:41.920 problem with a guy like trump that old
02:53:43.760 and still i won this and big
02:53:46.000 like all the craziness
02:53:48.399 like the girl used to bang called her
02:53:50.000 horse face on twitter like that kind of
02:53:51.359 crazy
02:53:52.399 yeah that kind of craziness it's like
02:53:55.600 but you come to expected of him though
02:53:57.520 it became very entertaining man he made
02:53:59.359 it all entertaining but then it was a
02:54:00.880 show in people's lives but it's like
02:54:02.479 close like you know how
02:54:04.720 you'll see old person dressed up and you
02:54:07.439 know that maybe like 30 years ago that
02:54:10.319 outfit was the [ __ ]
02:54:12.560 you know what i mean
02:54:14.080 yeah but but but maybe he's not killing
02:54:16.080 it today and it's it's like you you
02:54:18.479 could see him put it on one time and
02:54:20.640 just be like this is it go on without me
02:54:23.200 fashion keep going isn't it funny how
02:54:24.800 fashion eventually comes back around and
02:54:26.880 then you got dudes dressing up like
02:54:28.240 they're old-timey photographers
02:54:32.319 when i grew up this summer for me i just
02:54:34.240 grew up with it
02:54:35.359 i don't even give a [ __ ] you know what
02:54:36.960 i'm saying i'm like i remember this
02:54:38.880 summer sun i was starting to buy [ __ ]
02:54:40.560 that had waterproof on it you know what
02:54:42.240 i mean reversible
02:54:44.080 i was i was like [ __ ] that [ __ ] city
02:54:46.640 boy [ __ ]
02:54:48.560 i was buying [ __ ] that was fitting for
02:54:50.880 the condition and the weather that i was
02:54:52.560 in
02:54:53.200 right clothes become utilitarian yeah i
02:54:55.760 was like brother you get out of a city
02:54:57.760 your guy wears a work clothes for you
02:55:00.080 know to work in the world that's right
02:55:02.399 everything's practical
02:55:04.560 alaskans understand that [ __ ]
02:55:06.640 boy do they they get it it'd be a hard
02:55:08.800 place to go like if i had to go buy some
02:55:11.040 clothes for a date in alaska boy that's
02:55:13.359 a tough one yeah yeah you have nothing
02:55:15.600 to do i hope you like waders [ __ ]
02:55:18.319 you got a few days a year where it's
02:55:20.160 cold where it's not cold outside and
02:55:22.479 those days it's light 24 hours but those
02:55:24.720 people are conditioning for it now but
02:55:26.560 that's where it's weird when it's 24
02:55:27.920 hours out of it they had all these signs
02:55:30.160 up because this was like in november all
02:55:32.000 these it was like game of thrones winter
02:55:33.840 is coming and there were these signs
02:55:35.760 that said get your happy lights have you
02:55:37.200 heard of this no they're like uh uv
02:55:39.680 lights that people put in their house to
02:55:41.600 to mimic sunshine just so that they
02:55:43.520 don't
02:55:44.560 get depressed
02:55:46.240 i couldn't sleep
02:55:47.600 they're homegrown man it's like all
02:55:50.240 that's crazy do you remember that uh
02:55:52.080 there was a vampire movie a few years
02:55:54.080 back called 30 days of night i don't
02:55:56.319 know it's all about vampires that show
02:55:57.920 up in alaska because there's 30 days
02:56:00.319 where it never gets light out oh that's
02:56:02.160 a good premise so these vampires just
02:56:04.000 [ __ ] this town up for 30 days because
02:56:06.560 they know when so they they bring this
02:56:08.800 vampire familiar that pulls the boat
02:56:10.720 into the anchorage shore or whatever the
02:56:12.640 [ __ ] they landed and they get out in
02:56:14.240 this small town and just wreak havoc on
02:56:16.399 this town for 30 days robin williams and
02:56:19.120 al pacino did a movie the opposite of
02:56:20.640 that it's called insomnia you ever seen
02:56:22.560 that i didn't see that it was a weird
02:56:25.279 character thing pacino's character uh is
02:56:27.520 a cop
02:56:28.960 uh this is real and and
02:56:31.520 and rob uh robin williams is
02:56:34.080 a guy he's looking for for an anus crime
02:56:36.479 right
02:56:37.600 the the backdrop of the movie was that
02:56:39.520 it was daylight for 24 hours a day and
02:56:42.479 the guy had terrible insomnia
02:56:46.080 oh
02:56:49.200 that's a rough way to live
02:56:51.040 when it never gets dark out i remember
02:56:53.840 doing it uh when i was in anchorage i
02:56:56.080 was with uh did shows up there with
02:56:57.520 aries fear and we went uh fishing
02:56:59.920 and it was like two o'clock in the
02:57:01.359 morning it was bright outside i was like
02:57:02.960 this is weird man i would love that it's
02:57:05.680 weird
02:57:07.439 it i would love it too fishing at two
02:57:08.960 o'clock oh yeah you can just keep going
02:57:10.800 there's parts where it gets dark like
02:57:12.560 bears did you fly you fly fish no we uh
02:57:15.200 we're trolling for salmon how do you
02:57:17.359 travel for salmon you pull a boat you've
02:57:19.279 got like a boat and you cast some lures
02:57:21.359 in and you're really trying to get the
02:57:22.960 salmon aggravated that's what they
02:57:24.560 wanted they're not really hungry at that
02:57:26.319 point they're trying to [ __ ] so when
02:57:28.000 they they get your lure they're really
02:57:29.680 pissed off at it more than anything
02:57:32.080 jesus christ people have thought of
02:57:33.359 everything who the [ __ ] would think to
02:57:35.680 aggravate a fish aggravate salmon yeah
02:57:38.240 somebody that needed that yeah there's
02:57:39.760 certain salmon that only eat plankton
02:57:42.000 they don't need they eat like
02:57:43.120 microscopic [ __ ]
02:57:44.800 like they don't really eat fish this is
02:57:47.200 in a river you're doing it yeah you you
02:57:49.359 pull lures but i think that's um
02:57:52.160 is that chinook or sockeye or i'm trying
02:57:54.080 to figure out which one doesn't really
02:57:55.760 eat fish and the only time you catch
02:57:57.520 them is when you piss them off i don't
02:57:59.359 know nothing about my salmons
02:58:02.399 like sockeye i don't know my salmons had
02:58:04.800 different personalities than anything so
02:58:06.720 well some some fish
02:58:08.640 just eat fish right and some fish just
02:58:10.640 eat microscopic [ __ ] and there's one
02:58:12.800 particular type of salmon that only eats
02:58:14.800 microscopic [ __ ] and the way you catch
02:58:16.479 it is by getting it pissed
02:58:18.399 and that's in alaska they do that out of
02:58:20.000 like bristol bay i think that's chinook
02:58:22.160 is that correct
02:58:24.240 and uh salmon migrate right
02:58:26.319 yeah they migrate yeah so
02:58:28.560 are they salt water or are they fresh
02:58:30.560 water houses they're both okay that's
02:58:32.319 what i thought yeah they're they they
02:58:34.319 move through i forget what it's called
02:58:36.399 but they uh they go out to salt water
02:58:38.880 and they come back to spawn in fresh
02:58:40.319 water and they have to do it in the same
02:58:41.520 river so if you damn the river up
02:58:43.840 they're [ __ ] and they die they don't
02:58:45.680 know where to go and they they never
02:58:47.040 wind up reaping which is one of those
02:58:48.399 figures that's money like which one is
02:58:50.319 it
02:58:51.600 salmon's huge well you know out of all
02:58:53.200 fish it's like probably tuna
02:58:55.200 really yeah but there's you know they're
02:58:56.640 running out of tuna man they keep just
02:58:58.720 jacking tuna talk to those old tuna guys
02:59:01.439 in japan and they're like we used to see
02:59:03.120 a lot of tuna
02:59:04.640 now you go to the tuna market it's a
02:59:06.240 fraction of what it used to be there's
02:59:07.760 just not as much tuna left
02:59:09.680 yeah people love sushi
02:59:11.840 i know they do in atlanta
02:59:14.080 this was a lot of money
02:59:18.640 what happened
02:59:20.640 he's referring to it
02:59:22.560 i know that love of sushi and atlanta
02:59:24.960 bro they had a big thing about sushi in
02:59:26.800 atlanta what happened quick question
02:59:28.560 quick question before i go this is what
02:59:30.560 because this is coming up and the next
02:59:32.399 time we meet i want to ask you about
02:59:34.720 what you think
02:59:36.080 the vaccine
02:59:37.439 are you taking it i'll take it if it
02:59:39.120 works if i feel that the doctors
02:59:42.960 have
02:59:43.760 all gotten their
02:59:45.840 opinions behind it and they think you
02:59:47.439 know what it is is like an mrna vaccine
02:59:49.680 this new vaccine that makes your body
02:59:51.760 think that it doesn't introduce actual
02:59:54.399 covenant your system and you fight it
02:59:55.920 off it makes your body think that it's
02:59:57.200 covered and your body builds the proper
02:59:59.200 proteins to fight it off
03:00:01.040 a guy explained it to us yesterday
03:00:02.399 nicholas christakis he's from yale um
03:00:06.000 he thinks he likes no he doesn't he's a
03:00:07.760 good man
03:00:08.800 he uh he thinks that
03:00:11.120 he's a great man and i won't let you
03:00:12.960 disparage him like no i'm not
03:00:14.160 disparaging he's like he's certain
03:00:15.520 [ __ ] a soy bean muffin soybean he's a
03:00:18.240 doctor okay
03:00:19.680 anyway he uh he thinks the vaccine will
03:00:22.399 be uh very effective and uh even if you
03:00:25.760 if it doesn't keep you from getting it
03:00:27.120 it'll prevent or hopefully prevent you
03:00:29.520 from getting a bad case of it
03:00:31.840 i don't know though so so what would you
03:00:34.080 need would you would you would you need
03:00:35.920 just the consensus of a body of doctors
03:00:38.800 you trust and people's experiences
03:00:41.040 because people have already taken it so
03:00:42.800 if people have taken it like what is the
03:00:44.240 experience they say that they you know
03:00:45.920 had uh they felt like [ __ ] for a few
03:00:47.600 days
03:00:48.560 that's it
03:00:50.000 now is that true i mean who are they
03:00:53.200 have you talked to them what's a few
03:00:54.880 days and what do you mean by feel like
03:00:56.399 [ __ ] like did you try running four days
03:00:58.800 later and you still felt terrible like
03:01:00.640 so it apparently they're distributing
03:01:02.560 this vaccine almost now right
03:01:04.960 i don't think it's totally ready but it
03:01:07.120 very soon will be ready and uh if it's
03:01:09.840 effective they're going to encourage
03:01:11.120 people to take it it's it makes people
03:01:13.120 feel really nervous for like doctors and
03:01:15.040 like essential people
03:01:16.960 yeah first and then um it's going to
03:01:19.600 probably people that are high risk like
03:01:21.600 yeah but the thing is it's going to have
03:01:22.720 people have a sense of like there is
03:01:24.240 something that could be done now like
03:01:26.000 it's a sense of hope it's a sense of
03:01:28.080 progress it's a sense of like
03:01:30.160 you know we it was at one time we didn't
03:01:32.319 have a thought of a vaccine now we got
03:01:34.640 competitors and [ __ ] yeah people to
03:01:36.720 think different listen if it works we
03:01:38.880 should take it
03:01:40.240 just but i know how people get real
03:01:42.160 nervous people don't [ __ ] with vaccines
03:01:44.080 i told you that son how do you feel
03:01:45.520 about it hey black people don't [ __ ]
03:01:46.720 with no vaccines dave well i mean i feel
03:01:48.640 like it's inconclusive because your
03:01:50.560 caveat was i'd take it if i felt safe
03:01:53.520 about it yeah well that's just just the
03:01:55.760 thing don't you feel like that same way
03:01:57.439 of course but so now
03:02:00.479 you know for the first time we're
03:02:01.680 learning we're learning how a drug the
03:02:04.080 process of a drug you know going through
03:02:06.640 trials we're learning this
03:02:08.160 literally as a nation we're all watching
03:02:09.680 this thing take place an accelerated
03:02:11.600 version of it an accelerated version of
03:02:13.520 it because usually a vaccine takes
03:02:15.439 multiple years to develop yeah
03:02:17.840 so this is uh really quick to be able to
03:02:20.319 have something this quick and turn it
03:02:21.600 around and it's like those movies where
03:02:23.200 they find a cure by the end and you're
03:02:24.560 like oh it's [ __ ]
03:02:26.240 they're doing it well not a cure but a
03:02:28.840 vaccine that's a big deal
03:02:30.160 it's the good thing is if another one
03:02:32.399 comes around they're going to be more
03:02:33.920 prepared to do something like this
03:02:35.359 quicker
03:02:36.800 right
03:02:37.680 like i think people needed to really
03:02:39.920 understand that in our lifetime
03:02:41.840 something can kill the world's economy
03:02:43.760 and and kill hundreds of thousands of
03:02:45.600 people here and a million people
03:02:46.800 worldwide i think everybody i don't
03:02:48.640 think we i think we knew it but i don't
03:02:50.640 think we really expected it right now
03:02:52.800 they knew it they were the obama
03:02:54.399 administration had prepared for
03:02:56.000 precisely that eventually reality but i
03:02:58.000 mean us of course we couldn't write my
03:03:00.319 mind around it even if they told you
03:03:02.160 even if you watched bill gates speech
03:03:03.600 and ted talk in 2015 you would never
03:03:06.720 internalize it and think there's there's
03:03:08.800 a pandemic coming now nobody now we know
03:03:11.840 there is now the the we're going to want
03:03:14.080 to invest in the the
03:03:15.840 medical infrastructure to make sure that
03:03:17.279 they prepare better next time this is
03:03:19.840 hopefully people are going to learn from
03:03:20.960 this that's oh yeah 100 people know
03:03:23.359 glass has nothing to go nothing is going
03:03:25.200 to be new
03:03:26.560 there's nothing going to be new about it
03:03:28.080 no well the debate is is largely
03:03:30.080 philosophical right
03:03:31.840 i mean
03:03:32.720 to this thing
03:03:34.479 there's two schools of thought one
03:03:36.640 school of thought is it's just going to
03:03:38.560 be what it's going to be
03:03:40.720 and we'll you got to keep moving like
03:03:43.200 why close anything and the other school
03:03:45.279 thought which i thought was you know it
03:03:46.880 was more than just a philosophy it was
03:03:49.359 it was a science
03:03:50.960 right remember the premise when they
03:03:52.640 locked us up was we have to wait to
03:03:54.720 catch up to our medical infrastructure
03:03:56.640 yeah so we don't over burden our medical
03:03:58.080 infrastructure we got to suppress the
03:03:59.680 disease till we can build up the
03:04:01.359 infrastructure and they gave us an early
03:04:03.760 estimate of two weeks this is how a
03:04:05.120 comedian does
03:04:06.399 when the comedian is doing a real long
03:04:07.680 set he goes one more thing before i go
03:04:09.200 and then he does that four or five times
03:04:10.960 and you realize oh this guy's going to
03:04:12.000 do another hour oh yeah that's so
03:04:13.680 [ __ ] rude yeah yeah but you know that
03:04:15.520 trick yeah
03:04:16.720 that's what the pandemic the corn team
03:04:18.880 felt like
03:04:20.160 two more weeks three more weeks
03:04:22.479 maybe we'll open bars and you know that
03:04:24.479 kind of [ __ ]
03:04:26.399 but there's no way to control it other
03:04:28.319 than create it yourself right what do
03:04:30.160 you mean
03:04:31.120 like the the whole vibe of the the scene
03:04:34.840 right the vibe of which scene
03:04:37.840 the pandemic you said how do we get used
03:04:40.240 to it what can we do about it well he's
03:04:42.160 also saying here's the thing we never
03:04:43.920 signed up to let people tell us that we
03:04:45.600 can and can't take risks or go to work
03:04:48.000 and by saying that if you do it you're
03:04:50.160 going to kill other people that's what
03:04:51.520 changed the game right and so everybody
03:04:53.279 has to figure out how much of that
03:04:54.640 they're willing to accept
03:04:56.720 and how much of that are they not and
03:04:58.399 whether or not they're willing to take a
03:04:59.760 shot
03:05:00.720 um take this this vaccine without you
03:05:03.920 know knowing the long-term effects of it
03:05:06.240 or worrying about the long-term effects
03:05:08.000 of and some people are naturally averse
03:05:10.160 to taking any kind of medication they
03:05:11.600 don't want to do it and other people are
03:05:12.880 like if you tell me it's good and all
03:05:14.560 the doctors agree and it'll help mankind
03:05:18.000 i'll [ __ ] do it
03:05:19.920 that's how i feel if i listen
03:05:22.560 polio
03:05:23.840 okay [ __ ] doesn't exist anymore smallpox
03:05:26.080 doesn't exist anymore at least not in
03:05:27.359 the numbers that it used to be right
03:05:28.960 because
03:05:30.000 that's because of vaccines like the idea
03:05:32.640 that vaccines have done
03:05:34.800 bad things
03:05:36.080 only or that they're dangerous only it's
03:05:38.080 crazy like vaccines are the responsible
03:05:39.680 for the giant
03:05:41.359 vaccine i think the at the core this is
03:05:43.600 you just trust yes do you trust these
03:05:45.439 sources and people realize that they're
03:05:47.680 at the mercy of someone that they don't
03:05:49.920 necessarily trust
03:05:51.279 right that's the that's interrupt well
03:05:53.520 maybe maybe don't don't problem touch
03:05:55.680 your own face
03:05:56.880 don't go outside i'll tell you when to
03:05:58.399 come out said love a renowned liar yeah
03:06:01.680 right tough one
03:06:03.279 that was a tough one
03:06:05.040 especially here it goes something really
03:06:08.240 touches something really sore in the
03:06:09.680 core of an american's identity like you
03:06:11.760 said how can you tell me to do this yeah
03:06:14.720 it's crazy man this was a tough one here
03:06:16.880 it's a weird one it makes us redefine
03:06:19.680 what it is to be a person you know like
03:06:21.680 if all of a sudden
03:06:23.520 you have other people that got elected
03:06:25.600 into a position of power that's all they
03:06:27.680 did they want a popularity contest and
03:06:29.520 they're dictating
03:06:31.359 whether things go this way or that way
03:06:33.200 and they don't necessarily have the
03:06:34.960 right answer they just have their own
03:06:36.720 answer and dallas is doing it different
03:06:39.040 that this town and you know washington
03:06:41.439 state's doing it different than nevada
03:06:43.520 everyone's doing it different but
03:06:44.800 everybody's trying to do it also yeah
03:06:46.560 but governors can tell you what you can
03:06:48.960 and can't do it gets real weird and i
03:06:52.000 get it they're trying to keep the
03:06:53.279 hospital numbers down
03:06:54.840 but
03:06:56.399 you told us it was going to be two weeks
03:06:59.120 like you guys said two weeks and now
03:07:00.479 here we are like nine months later and
03:07:02.479 everyone's just waiting for only for a
03:07:04.160 vaccine but i'm not speaking about you
03:07:06.319 know if it's right if it's wrong
03:07:08.880 i'm not speaking about like that i'm
03:07:10.160 just saying whatever it was that was
03:07:12.240 very difficult
03:07:13.520 yeah that was very difficult very
03:07:15.439 difficult you know i was fine
03:07:17.520 but not knowing when you can work not
03:07:20.319 being able to move around not being able
03:07:21.680 to see my mother
03:07:23.200 you know
03:07:24.080 you would never thought if someone had
03:07:25.439 told me
03:07:26.800 11 months ago even the night before they
03:07:29.520 the last night we went to milwaukee yes
03:07:32.080 it was perhaps
03:07:33.680 the last show
03:07:35.680 it was the last night between shows
03:07:37.760 right it's a two show night
03:07:39.680 uh and the energy had changed it went
03:07:41.760 from festive to like people look worried
03:07:44.000 when i got off stage
03:07:45.600 and tom hanks had had it the one nba guy
03:07:48.000 who would touch everything that had it
03:07:49.840 and then the horn starts ringing they're
03:07:51.439 going to shut the country down i i
03:07:53.359 literally go that's impossible
03:07:56.399 we're going to shut down the world it's
03:07:57.840 impossible this is this is what i
03:07:59.279 thought my initial reaction
03:08:02.000 but the energy changed now i go out and
03:08:04.479 do the second show and immediately and i
03:08:06.640 wasn't even thinking about this [ __ ]
03:08:07.600 earlier tonight i come out on stage and
03:08:09.840 everybody reach your hand hey
03:08:11.760 i thought about it
03:08:14.560 okay i start you know shaking people's
03:08:16.560 hands
03:08:17.600 oh i'm worried but yeah it was just but
03:08:20.160 yeah the neighbor for wouldn't have even
03:08:22.560 been concerned about it went into the
03:08:24.399 green room for 40 minutes and talked to
03:08:26.000 people who've been glued to the
03:08:27.200 television watching the news
03:08:29.439 and then they they scared the [ __ ] out
03:08:31.040 of me my behavior changed almost
03:08:33.120 instantly it's interesting
03:08:37.200 i don't get too heavy i mean i'm only
03:08:38.640 hanging out with him no man that's how
03:08:39.920 it's this thing it's not too heavy
03:08:41.920 that's exactly how i felt about it too i
03:08:43.680 remember i shook a dude's hand on a
03:08:45.279 flight
03:08:46.399 i was flying to vegas for the fights it
03:08:48.000 was like one of the last fights before
03:08:49.279 they shut it down and uh some dude goes
03:08:51.040 i don't know you want to shake hands
03:08:52.000 like i'll shake your hand
03:08:53.680 we shook him he had a mask on already
03:08:55.760 and i was like wow he was ready to go
03:08:57.920 down he was i think this was the very
03:09:00.080 beginning of march this was the first
03:09:02.000 the first time i would have been um
03:09:04.399 tested any capacity was when i did your
03:09:06.479 show that time
03:09:08.080 that was the first time i had an
03:09:09.359 antibody test or anything
03:09:11.760 i would have never expected that here we
03:09:13.359 would be
03:09:14.399 deep into november
03:09:16.399 and we're all still kind of locked down
03:09:18.479 when this started you lived in l.a you
03:09:20.239 had no plans to come here yeah you're in
03:09:22.160 texas think about it your whole your
03:09:23.760 whole life has changed
03:09:25.520 what's interesting about this time was
03:09:27.120 another thing we should talk about next
03:09:28.399 time would come
03:09:30.880 is that the in mass it feels like we're
03:09:34.080 rewriting our social contracts you know
03:09:36.720 the whole thing
03:09:38.160 and covet is
03:09:40.319 an accelerant on this process that i
03:09:42.720 could have never imagined yeah
03:09:45.359 you know
03:09:47.680 they'll they're locked inside man people
03:09:49.760 are are stuck in a house with their
03:09:51.920 choices do you like your house do you
03:09:54.239 like who you're with
03:09:55.520 do you like these things you've
03:09:56.640 accumulated i hope you like them because
03:09:58.319 you're stuck with them
03:09:59.840 i make great choices i like my choices
03:10:02.479 you know when i was faced with it like
03:10:03.840 that i was like
03:10:05.040 i had it much better than many people
03:10:06.960 but imagining people doing that in mass
03:10:09.760 is pretty powerful it's a pretty
03:10:11.600 powerful thought what does this do to a
03:10:13.279 society
03:10:14.960 this type of isolation and
03:10:17.120 and almost forced reflection yeah which
03:10:20.080 is not necessarily a bad thing right
03:10:23.200 and
03:10:24.399 we've always talked about how life is a
03:10:26.080 rat race right people get stuck in this
03:10:28.319 rat race it feels never ending
03:10:31.760 it's not good that all these people lost
03:10:33.520 their jobs it's not good that all these
03:10:35.040 people are going to lose where they live
03:10:37.200 it might
03:10:38.399 help some people recognize that if you
03:10:41.200 just keep going in this rat race it just
03:10:42.800 it never ends you got to figure out a
03:10:44.479 way out and now is the better time to
03:10:46.640 figure out a way out than ever
03:10:48.319 because you kind of have to you kind of
03:10:50.479 have to and society as it existed 10
03:10:52.720 months ago it's not the same place it's
03:10:54.239 the same what's the country what's the
03:10:56.160 country that there's a country
03:10:59.359 maybe somewhere in south pacific or
03:11:01.359 something
03:11:02.319 that measures their
03:11:04.560 their success as a nation with what they
03:11:06.880 call their gross national happiness this
03:11:09.359 totally different premise what country
03:11:11.439 is that i can't remember maybe maybe you
03:11:14.080 google gross national happiness
03:11:16.960 thanks fingers
03:11:18.100 [Laughter]
03:11:20.080 says bhutan there it is bhutan there you
03:11:22.000 go this is a real this is a real
03:11:23.520 principle it's a philosophy guys the
03:11:25.120 government think about this this is a
03:11:26.560 philosophy that guides the government of
03:11:27.760 bhutan it includes an index which is
03:11:29.760 used to measure the collective happiness
03:11:31.760 this is the metric that they use to
03:11:33.920 define their success if they tried that
03:11:35.920 in america they'd turn into an app and
03:11:37.520 it would [ __ ] up everything oh my god
03:11:39.439 people would just be striving to win the
03:11:41.520 points on the app
03:11:43.120 it would make people insane they'd get
03:11:44.720 addicted to trying to be a better person
03:11:49.040 this is this is the vastly this is a
03:11:51.120 vastly better metric i'm not you know a
03:11:53.680 communist none of that [ __ ]
03:11:55.520 but i i think that i know too many
03:11:58.080 people who are very wealthy
03:12:00.080 who have what i consider poor quality of
03:12:02.160 life just because
03:12:05.040 like you say the wealth is the point
03:12:07.760 yeah they chased it they chased it and
03:12:10.000 they didn't have any friends right
03:12:11.760 you're very welcome you're hunting
03:12:14.000 you love your dog your dog hangs out
03:12:16.319 with you like [ __ ] scooby doo your
03:12:18.000 kids like your kids like you you you
03:12:20.800 you're living an adventure of a life now
03:12:22.960 you're doing the same thing you're doing
03:12:24.239 in l.a in a totally different city just
03:12:26.239 because you're following that knowing
03:12:28.080 feeling i got to be free whatever it is
03:12:30.319 there's a little bit of that and then
03:12:31.520 there's also like uh i think you're
03:12:33.600 better off living in a place with less
03:12:35.040 people
03:12:36.000 i think when you live to be you live in
03:12:38.560 a place with like l.a it's great in that
03:12:40.960 there's a lot of resources there's a lot
03:12:42.399 of [ __ ] happening there's a lot of
03:12:43.520 people but it's bad in that
03:12:46.640 sometimes people it diminishes
03:12:49.279 the value of people a little bit when
03:12:51.200 there's so many of them like people stop
03:12:53.359 thinking about nlp is valuable i don't
03:12:55.279 even think that it's it's that for me
03:12:57.439 the thing the thing that i always had a
03:12:59.760 hard time with was the point of the
03:13:01.359 place was show business yeah
03:13:03.600 so when i was coming up in my career
03:13:05.680 everything reminded me
03:13:08.080 of the things i didn't have
03:13:10.560 and nothing let me appreciate where i
03:13:12.840 was and then now i love it it's a
03:13:15.680 winner's circle i'm doing great so i can
03:13:17.840 get in any restaurant
03:13:19.439 you know yeah but i remember what it
03:13:21.200 felt like being there it's like that's
03:13:23.520 why i don't live there no disrespect to
03:13:25.520 l.a but it's like if i like a restaurant
03:13:27.279 i don't move in and say i just come when
03:13:29.040 i want to eat almost live in the
03:13:30.880 restaurant
03:13:32.720 i think your your idea of living in
03:13:34.640 another place gives you perspective
03:13:37.040 there's no question it's the best way to
03:13:39.200 have perspective if you're stuck in that
03:13:41.040 showbiz world
03:13:42.640 you know that becomes your culture your
03:13:44.960 culture is like this tiny fraction
03:13:47.359 of the human beings in the world and so
03:13:48.960 many people just start relating only to
03:13:51.120 people in that culture
03:13:52.880 like that you can get real isolated that
03:13:55.200 way yes it's not yeah and and and for
03:13:58.080 what we do for a living how is that
03:14:00.080 conducive to anything yeah we want to
03:14:02.239 see why artistically no it's a very wise
03:14:04.960 decision like really what yes that
03:14:06.960 smells great i told you son that's the
03:14:09.120 ones that candle is the [ __ ] i'll do a
03:14:11.040 commercial for right now you cut this

03:17:32.239 so i just started sexing it up like just
03:17:34.160 having fun
03:17:35.520 and and and then when you start getting
03:17:37.439 bigger on the road you start bringing
03:17:39.600 your friends out and all that [ __ ] then
03:17:41.359 it gets really fun and you become like a
03:17:43.279 surrogate family the longer you stay out
03:17:45.200 together you know you learn each other's
03:17:46.880 creature habits you find out [ __ ] about
03:17:48.640 each other you don't know you see [ __ ]

03:18:02.479 coming maybe that night that we not
03:18:04.080 doing any stand up i had my drone that
03:18:06.000 night
03:18:07.520 oh yeah yeah yeah we had my drone i
03:18:09.760 don't even know how to fly my own drone
03:18:11.279 one of my friends was flying the drone
03:18:13.600 and it was late at night was like yo get
03:18:15.200 the drone shot so we get the drone shots
03:18:17.680 and then the drone went up in the air
03:18:19.120 it's like about two o'clock in the
03:18:20.399 morning and we thought we lost the drone
03:18:22.800 we didn't see no red lights no blue
03:18:24.560 lights it was just god we was like oh
03:18:26.720 [ __ ]
03:18:28.080 [ __ ] we got to go find a drone we like
03:18:30.239 we about to get out of here we thought
03:18:32.000 we lost the drone the drone was supposed
03:18:33.520 to be at um
03:18:35.120 at the um bed and breakfast
03:18:37.920 well can you control those things like
03:18:39.760 the people that know how to drive it
03:18:41.200 they can control where they can't see it
03:18:42.960 through like measurements and distance
03:18:44.560 and everything
03:18:45.680 yes things are good though they had
03:18:47.520 buttons on the you know they could track
03:18:49.600 track a person on an object if you
03:18:51.439 wanted to just follow a car or anything
03:18:53.600 like that really remember in l.a the
03:18:55.600 paparazzi started doing all this crazy
03:18:57.600 drone [ __ ] i'm sure they got you
03:18:59.760 the drone guys we had the drone shot i
03:19:01.680 was drinking coffee you hear the buzzing
03:19:05.600 yeah you hear this [ __ ] and you know
03:19:07.279 that there's a dude a block away
03:19:08.960 somewhere isn't that weird like they
03:19:10.239 could
03:19:10.960 they could kind of find you now with a
03:19:13.120 drone well we did the drone shot from
03:19:15.200 the place we thought we lost we was
03:19:17.200 going to go and search i was like get my
03:19:18.800 [ __ ] drone [ __ ] right we get
03:19:21.279 ready get everybody in the car to go
03:19:23.120 find this drone
03:19:24.399 we don't see this guy nowhere to all of
03:19:26.000 a sudden suddenly it was like a movie we
03:19:28.160 saw these blue lights come up
03:19:30.000 and we heard this
03:19:31.200 and that [ __ ] came everybody was
03:19:32.960 like oh [ __ ] they got the drone
03:19:35.600 and that [ __ ] came all the way back down
03:19:37.920 son oh that was a good shot that was a
03:19:40.160 great shot i met the governor of texas i
03:19:43.120 went to the mansion to hang out with him
03:19:44.640 governor abbott and i had whiskey and
03:19:47.359 barbecue with him
03:19:49.040 and while we're hanging out at his house
03:19:50.479 a drone comes by and hovers
03:19:53.439 in the sky that's the one the light goes
03:19:55.520 on and we're watching this drone the
03:19:57.279 security guys are trying to figure out
03:19:58.720 where the drone's coming from and who's
03:20:00.239 got the drone and it turned out to be
03:20:02.160 like the fire department the fire
03:20:03.840 department has their own drone and
03:20:05.359 they're flying their drone around
03:20:06.399 looking for stuff that makes a lot of
03:20:07.920 sense man but they they're like that's
03:20:10.319 like how you can spot fires how they can
03:20:12.239 figure out what's going on if there's
03:20:14.160 some sort of car accident they could
03:20:16.080 probably send a drone out get video
03:20:18.160 image of it so they know what to expect
03:20:19.439 when they get there
03:20:20.640 makes sense right
03:20:22.560 there's a new car like that some it's a
03:20:25.040 drone
03:20:26.080 the headlights are drones
03:20:28.720 you gotta look this up man
03:20:30.880 what is it the headlights fly away what
03:20:32.800 do you mean
03:20:33.920 the headlights are attached to the car
03:20:36.800 right they're on
03:20:38.640 if you get out of the car
03:20:40.800 they pop off and start flying around and
03:20:43.279 make a path of light
03:20:45.680 that's that's i think that's the thing
03:20:48.000 audi created an autonomous off-roader
03:20:49.840 that uses flying drones to illuminate
03:20:51.760 the road instead of headlights show joe
03:20:53.200 the video what it's ill as [ __ ] it's
03:20:55.920 it's oh [ __ ] oh my god they're ahead of
03:20:57.760 the car the [ __ ] headlights are ahead
03:21:00.160 of the car it's the illest [ __ ] i've
03:21:01.760 ever seen that's some star wars [ __ ]
03:21:04.560 right yeah precision drones
03:21:07.359 if if you have a key in your pocket
03:21:09.040 they'll follow you like if you're
03:21:10.479 walking in the woods it's crazy
03:21:13.359 that thing looks wild it looks like some
03:21:15.040 [ __ ] jamie foxx drives already he
03:21:17.200 already has one of those yeah
03:21:19.920 jimmy fox probably already has this he
03:21:21.840 has one of those resvani's isn't that
03:21:24.319 what it's called it's like a resvani
03:21:26.000 tank

03:21:36.960 that's crazy there's a somewhere online
03:21:39.200 there's a video demonstration
03:21:41.279 and it's probably going to be electric
03:21:43.120 right yeah yeah yeah is it yeah
