00:00:12.960 day what's up how are you I can't
00:00:16.760 believe we never met each other until
00:00:18.279 today that's kind of crazy it's really
00:00:20.519 weird it's kind of crazy it was always
00:00:22.840 like at the store like cat was here last
00:00:24.439 night I'm like [ __ ] it was always two
00:00:27.599 ships in the
00:00:28.759 night right I would I would see you and
00:00:31.840 I'll be able to get to
00:00:33.760 you like comedy is small
00:00:38.040 but only if you're
00:00:41.320 mediocre this big is a vast vast place
00:00:46.120 it's vast and it's also small cuz
00:00:48.559 there's so few of us and worldwide we
00:00:51.840 were talking about this the other day
00:00:53.160 there's maybe 500 of us on the
00:00:57.600 planet you know you got to be real
00:00:59.440 generous say 500 cuz it's really
00:01:01.079 probably about 250 right but legit
00:01:04.799 Comics guys you want to hang out with
00:01:07.040 guys who are
00:01:09.720 fun going down num's going down your
00:01:12.119 number's going down Guys Who You'd
00:01:13.960 recommend leave your house get a
00:01:16.000 babysitter the numbers going down there
00:01:18.759 not a lot of people right you think
00:01:21.320 about the billions and billions of
00:01:22.840 people on the planet there's a little
00:01:24.400 smidgen of
00:01:26.040 us well
00:01:28.840 as as children we all take to talking
00:01:33.280 with ease and so the fact that later on
00:01:37.000 your life you be one of the people that
00:01:40.600 could say I talk for a
00:01:42.560 living is um an amazing honor it's
00:01:46.759 amazing even if you look a thousand
00:01:48.840 years back yeah especially today to you
00:01:52.320 be able to talk for a living oh my God
00:01:55.880 what and that that's the problem also
00:01:57.600 with what we do is that everybody can
00:01:59.320 talk so they see you talking they're
00:02:01.640 like I can do what he's doing right he's
00:02:03.119 just up there talking and the better you
00:02:04.600 do it the easier it looks which is part
00:02:07.039 of the Trap yeah it's part of the Trap
00:02:09.479 it looks like he doesn't think about
00:02:11.000 what he says he just says stuff but you
00:02:13.680 you couldn't be as accurate No No and
00:02:17.800 then there's hanging around with Comics
00:02:19.920 getting to know about [ __ ] like their
00:02:21.000 electric
00:02:24.440 rolls-royces
00:02:26.200 right right if Satan hits me just know
00:02:30.000 I'm heading back immediately you're
00:02:32.519 going to know about it if I've ever
00:02:34.519 heard yeah the electric Spectre that
00:02:37.560 thing is insane that thing's insane just
00:02:40.200 the way the doors open up the way the
00:02:42.080 doors Clos when you touch the
00:02:45.440 brakes totally silent for the price
00:02:48.480 point it has it would have to be perfect
00:02:51.920 and the whole thing is it is and that's
00:02:56.720 that's what you're trying to do in any
00:02:58.959 genre like you're trying to find that
00:03:01.560 thing that is Flawless in that genre
00:03:05.799 right and uh that's it that's the
00:03:08.440 Rolls-Royce I've never had one of those
00:03:11.680 right well because because it's
00:03:14.040 important to you that you be grounded in
00:03:16.959 the important ways so I can see you not
00:03:20.000 have had having not had a Rolls-Royce
00:03:23.080 I've had four
00:03:25.080 five I'm not opposed to it it's just uh
00:03:29.480 the the idea of it to me is like don't
00:03:31.680 do that for me you know I'm always like
00:03:34.200 d get away from
00:03:36.480 that muscle what well see you see what I
00:03:39.799 mean yeah because because we live
00:03:42.560 vicariously through these things and
00:03:44.640 it's been that way for all of humankind
00:03:47.000 I'm saying it was still like that um for
00:03:51.040 the Roman and his Chariot like that's
00:03:53.400 how he felt like that's that's how
00:03:55.400 Horsemen feel about that ride you know
00:03:58.439 like yeah yeah transportation and people
00:04:02.319 have a love story yeah that's really the
00:04:06.280 only object that I'm really into like
00:04:09.599 I'm I'm into yeah Vehicles I'm into
00:04:12.200 mechanical Vehicles right there's like
00:04:14.400 something about mechanical vehicles that
00:04:15.959 just speak to me I love them I love
00:04:19.399 looking at them I love sitting in them I
00:04:21.798 love driving them it's just like it's
00:04:23.720 one of the things that people say like
00:04:24.919 money can't buy and happiness that's
00:04:26.560 definitely true if you're [ __ ] up
00:04:27.759 you're not going to get happier if you
00:04:29.720 get rich but if you're already
00:04:31.880 reasonably happy and you can afford a
00:04:34.440 nice muscle car God damn you'll feel
00:04:37.240 happier you will feel happier but every
00:04:41.000 time every time so what I'm saying is
00:04:43.240 when I got the 67 Chevy Camaro I needed
00:04:47.199 no other cars I was complete when I got
00:04:51.199 the Grand National you couldn't tell me
00:04:54.199 anything there was nothing on the
00:04:56.320 highway that was of my ilk but I felt
00:05:00.479 that
00:05:01.199 way um 12 13 times that's what makes it
00:05:04.880 real love yeah they give you real joy
00:05:07.680 every time you drive them and you feel
00:05:10.600 like that character in that movie you
00:05:13.960 know like yeah yeah you drive in 1970
00:05:17.080 chevel you feel like John Wick yeah it's
00:05:19.360 a sacred sacred place there's music
00:05:22.479 there there's recklessness but there's
00:05:25.360 safety you know it's like um it it gets
00:05:28.600 to the essence of a being and I think
00:05:32.880 it's a thing that won't exist 100 years
00:05:34.759 from now I think automated driving will
00:05:37.280 be mandatory I really do I don't I think
00:05:40.479 we're about a 100 years away 100 years
00:05:43.280 away from no no personal
00:05:46.479 automobiles no control over your vehicle
00:05:48.800 we're going to stop all crashes if we
00:05:50.520 could stop all crashes and all highway
00:05:52.160 deaths come on cat won't you contribute
00:05:54.720 and give up all your rights to drive
00:05:56.720 we're going to stop all death yeah it's
00:05:59.000 not but understand that
00:06:01.120 it all of these things have um Financial
00:06:05.280 benefits and then they use those perks
00:06:08.000 you just mentioned to get you in but I I
00:06:11.319 yeah some making money I believe that um
00:06:14.680 it'll be mandatory but but for practical
00:06:18.199 reasons like this thing where the police
00:06:20.960 want you and they have to chase you and
00:06:22.759 you may get away those those days are
00:06:25.639 done yeah they're just going to shut
00:06:26.880 your car off yeah your car is going to
00:06:29.639 do what they tell it to do which is get
00:06:31.720 behind this patrol car and follow us to
00:06:33.840 the station there speculation that they
00:06:36.720 they've had that for a long time you
00:06:38.280 know there was uh that that famous
00:06:40.639 journalist Michael Hastings that was his
00:06:42.639 name there's this journalist I don't
00:06:44.080 know if you know the story but it's
00:06:45.759 pretty crazy this guy went to um
00:06:48.960 Afghanistan so Afghanistan with the
00:06:51.160 troops and he was only supposed to be
00:06:52.759 there riding a rolling stone article
00:06:54.199 about this general for a very short
00:06:55.479 amount of time but then there was the
00:06:57.280 volcano in Iceland and the volcano in
00:07:00.360 Iceland stopped air travel so he this
00:07:03.039 journalist from the Rolling Stone was
00:07:05.599 embedded in this this troop and they
00:07:09.160 started talking [ __ ] and he started
00:07:11.199 reporting the [ __ ] that they were
00:07:12.440 talking including disparaging comments
00:07:14.960 that the general had said about Obama so
00:07:17.360 the general gets back he has to retire
00:07:20.120 he has to you know it's the Rolling
00:07:22.120 Stone exposed it's a big deal because
00:07:23.759 everybody loves his General so he
00:07:25.599 retires and this Michael Hastings guy is
00:07:28.080 on the run and he terrified he's telling
00:07:30.479 people if if I commit suicide I did not
00:07:33.000 kill myself people are threatening my
00:07:34.919 life and then he's going down lraa and
00:07:37.919 his car is going like 120 miles an hour
00:07:42.280 and just slams into a tree and explodes
00:07:45.919 and there's a video footage of it this
00:07:48.120 dude is just fly look at that flying
00:07:50.000 down the
00:07:51.240 street hits a tree and the car explodes
00:07:55.639 and they ask Security Experts at that
00:07:57.720 time I think this was like 2005
00:08:02.120 four 2004
00:08:04.440 2005 is it possible to control a vehicle
00:08:07.639 remotely they said does your vehicle
00:08:09.400 have a computer if your vehicle has a
00:08:11.680 computer they can control it period
00:08:14.840 there's a way and they know that and
00:08:16.919 they've been doing that for this is 2010
00:08:19.319 2010 so this is 14 [ __ ] years ago
00:08:22.800 easy pey if they could do that then what
00:08:25.720 can they do now they just shut your
00:08:27.240 [ __ ] car right off that's his article
00:08:29.400 man I'm sorry so I think the ACT
00:08:30.919 accident was 2013 oh there you go well
00:08:33.399 how was the article in 2010 if the
00:08:34.958 accidents in
00:08:36.080 2013 uh well the article came out first
00:08:38.958 and exposed mistal oh oh the Rolling
00:08:41.679 Stone article I thought you me the
00:08:42.880 article on on the accident if you
00:08:45.000 actually do reading about
00:08:47.480 Tesla see that's the thing Joe that
00:08:50.440 that's why I love history so much
00:08:52.519 because once you find out that this
00:08:54.720 world is a circle you can never get lost
00:08:58.600 like right you can look at certain
00:09:00.640 things and it'll tell you what's going
00:09:02.600 to happen later like with amazing
00:09:06.079 accuracy like
00:09:09.600 um yeah like that's how I knew that
00:09:13.200 things like what you showed me with
00:09:14.680 Hastings that those were real things
00:09:17.000 yeah um it's not they've always been
00:09:18.760 real it's everybody who has ever been
00:09:21.480 killed in one of those ways there was a
00:09:23.760 financial benefit to it it was obvious
00:09:26.240 it was easy you know where it came from
00:09:28.839 it's just that they do a good job but H
00:09:31.320 how is that difficult if that's your job
00:09:34.480 like they do this they do this really
00:09:37.519 well they do it worldwide um also this
00:09:41.200 guy [ __ ] with the worst person you
00:09:43.040 could [ __ ] with a high ranking beloved
00:09:45.839 General who's in charge of train Killers
00:09:48.640 who love him and you don't think he
00:09:50.680 could put one of those dudes on you with
00:09:52.560 a coffee meeting just have a sit down at
00:09:56.279 Starbucks with no phones on you and let
00:09:59.680 me explain what's going on a shadow
00:10:02.279 government is no more difficult than a
00:10:04.240 government yeah and so not only that you
00:10:07.120 don't they don't have to get elected
00:10:08.399 it's even better even nicer they stay
00:10:11.160 for a long time they can I mean think
00:10:14.279 about Jay Edgar Hoover how long did that
00:10:17.240 [ __ ] stay in power for he was
00:10:19.399 running the FBI wearing a dress for like
00:10:21.240 30 years because of what you just
00:10:24.760 discussed like
00:10:26.720 like there are that
00:10:29.880 that's why I can speak with impunity
00:10:31.760 about the Illuminati because I know who
00:10:36.639 you would have to be in order for what
00:10:39.519 I'm saying to bother you number one
00:10:42.320 right number two I know your big secret
00:10:44.920 I know that you're not the Illuminati I
00:10:48.040 am
00:10:50.440 so you can't be illuminated you're too
00:10:54.279 dark but the the difficulty is getting
00:10:58.040 people to believe something something
00:10:59.360 that they don't want to believe and in
00:11:01.360 each of these cases this is where the
00:11:03.760 money is if you're just a capitalist it
00:11:06.959 is find something establish a value for
00:11:11.200 it and make sure that that includes your
00:11:13.360 profit and make sure people really want
00:11:15.560 it right it it it's very fundamental
00:11:19.760 also if you're running corporations and
00:11:22.040 you're making billions dollars yeah
00:11:24.120 you're going to get bored what's the
00:11:25.920 ultimate game the ultimate game is a run
00:11:28.399 the whole world you know what the
00:11:29.720 ultimate game is cat I do we have an
00:11:32.040 overpopulation problem cat yeah it's an
00:11:35.000 overpopulation problem right and we're
00:11:37.200 going to we're going to be able to
00:11:38.240 mitigate that with
00:11:39.519 vaccines we're going to be able to
00:11:41.200 mitigate that with with health care
00:11:43.360 right we're going to figure that out
00:11:44.320 we're going to we're going to get rid of
00:11:45.399 a bunch of people we used to be able to
00:11:47.079 do it with neglect and it was called
00:11:49.279 Nature's Way right you know like like
00:11:53.160 whatever was ailing you it wasn't ailing
00:11:55.720 everybody in the world the Chinese
00:11:58.240 didn't have it because they had 6,000
00:12:01.160 herbs 6,000 years ago and knew what each
00:12:04.399 one did and you know like you know
00:12:07.760 people are very resistant to that when
00:12:09.959 they don't realize that almost all
00:12:11.680 pharmaceutical drugs come from plants a
00:12:14.680 big can't be against the original yeah
00:12:17.839 it's ridiculous that's that's government
00:12:20.199 propaganda working on you that's like
00:12:21.880 when they remember when they had Marinol
00:12:23.720 when they were making weed illegal and
00:12:26.120 the people had were going through cancer
00:12:27.959 and their doctors are prescribed him
00:12:29.399 weed for chemotherapy so they gave him
00:12:31.160 Marinol do you remember that [ __ ] I do
00:12:33.399 it's like a synthetic version of weed
00:12:35.760 that's terrible
00:12:38.160 I but but terrible is subjective right
00:12:43.920 to nothing so they have this um oil like
00:12:49.800 cannabis that is for um people having
00:12:53.600 seizures right and it's the only thing
00:12:56.000 that will stop a seizure yeah it's
00:12:57.880 incredible it is but here's the
00:13:01.920 thing the fact that there is a
00:13:04.880 God is the
00:13:07.680 biggest conversation worldwide but the
00:13:11.680 truth of the matter
00:13:13.639 is there is more reason for you to
00:13:16.600 believe there is a God than there is for
00:13:19.279 you to not like the way that things
00:13:22.399 interact like if we're just talking
00:13:24.440 about marijuana or alcohol or whatever
00:13:27.320 that is you have to understand that this
00:13:30.639 thing serves no other
00:13:33.560 purpose than to bring pleasure to this
00:13:37.120 small group of beings right and the fact
00:13:41.000 that it already was set up to do that
00:13:43.800 the fact that it was already set up on
00:13:45.880 this planet for there to be medicines
00:13:48.120 for us to find and to utilize and you
00:13:51.560 see what I'm saying it's like it's not
00:13:53.440 like oh yeah so he made a cow no to make
00:13:56.600 a cow it means you had to also have m
00:13:58.839 grass and it means you would have had to
00:14:00.839 have invented a whole new eating system
00:14:03.000 for this animal which was cud and that
00:14:05.600 means you would you would then have to
00:14:07.399 have given him three stomachs to be able
00:14:09.240 to and you would have to have known that
00:14:11.160 he was going to then emit a gas that was
00:14:13.160 going to be necessary and on the planet
00:14:15.959 like yeah like none of these things
00:14:19.199 fertilizer are right the fact that
00:14:21.519 everything goes together is how you know
00:14:24.360 it's pretty wild and every time we step
00:14:26.040 in and [ __ ] with it it goes Haywire
00:14:29.199 right every time human beings do it
00:14:30.959 predictably Haywire Haywire Haywire
00:14:33.839 right but that's part of that's part of
00:14:36.079 the benefits of Free Will mhm is you
00:14:38.680 really can jump into a volcano dude
00:14:42.120 yeah Haywire you really can I mean think
00:14:45.880 about what we've done to Wildlife the W
00:14:47.959 the the craziest thing in this country
00:14:49.959 especially right here is pigs bro wild
00:14:52.360 pigs are
00:14:53.639 everywhere and there's so many of them I
00:14:56.720 went to a friend of mine's Farm or well
00:14:58.720 like a ranch to to hunt wild pigs and uh
00:15:01.720 you just hear them like like Lord of the
00:15:03.920 Rings characters in the
00:15:06.680 bushes and there's 150 of them near you
00:15:10.560 250 of them thousands on the ranch
00:15:13.720 they're all over the place and they have
00:15:15.199 three litters a year and they start
00:15:17.000 having litters when they're 6 months old
00:15:19.160 they just pump out piglets let's
00:15:21.440 go you can tell they're not delicious
00:15:24.199 they are delicious oh well then here we
00:15:26.519 go then we don't really we don't have a
00:15:29.240 problem then do we no we have a we need
00:15:31.240 to eat Pig's problem no we we need to be
00:15:36.000 sending this off somewhere to someone
00:15:38.440 who does well definitely we should that
00:15:40.959 would be an easy way to solve a lot of
00:15:43.160 hunger problems I'm saying we live in a
00:15:44.800 country where we're complaining about
00:15:46.279 food sources it's a good point these
00:15:48.360 chickens are pecking us to death they're
00:15:52.240 everywhere I can't even sleep yeah but
00:15:55.759 they're delicious right yeah have more
00:15:58.079 chickens
00:15:59.880 yeah for sure yeah we do have an
00:16:02.040 overabundance problem for sure we really
00:16:04.240 do but the pig thing is a wild one it's
00:16:07.040 it's hard to get them like you got to
00:16:08.920 you they're very smart and they spread
00:16:11.000 out and there's so [ __ ] many of them
00:16:12.680 they shoot it with helicopters fly
00:16:15.800 over I've been invited three times since
00:16:19.079 I moved here to go shoot pigs out of a
00:16:20.839 helicopter but that's part of the reason
00:16:23.240 that you came to Texas the freedom for
00:16:26.079 sure Texas is a place of great Adventure
00:16:29.920 yeah and people who believe in that like
00:16:33.199 it's really God's country in the right
00:16:35.160 places it is in the right places I think
00:16:37.920 you're going to have annoying people
00:16:39.839 everywhere you go in this world but in
00:16:42.399 general I think the people here overall
00:16:44.600 are nicer they're friendlier and they're
00:16:46.920 not captured they're not captured by The
00:16:49.759 Ether of Hollywood that they haven't
00:16:51.440 been sucked into the The Vortex of
00:16:54.480 ideological thinking and just that
00:16:57.279 weirdness of that
00:16:59.319 so when you escape that and just be
00:17:00.759 around regular people you're like oh
00:17:02.319 people are all right I'm just been in an
00:17:05.039 asane sylm you're looking for a
00:17:07.359 girlfriend you know like you you have to
00:17:09.919 be in a place where you're around good
00:17:12.919 people like normal people that's better
00:17:15.119 for you you're not trying to say that
00:17:17.480 people that happen to live there are not
00:17:20.280 nice people there's a lot of nice people
00:17:22.119 there here's the
00:17:23.839 thing hopefully we can agree that the
00:17:26.959 problem is with extremes
00:17:28.960 yes extreme anything yes extreme left is
00:17:32.280 as vicious and
00:17:34.640 as as far right yep it's you know the
00:17:39.919 middleness of it all that makes America
00:17:42.840 great and Texas has been front and
00:17:45.919 center of that forever I think a a big
00:17:50.200 part of it though is how much does your
00:17:51.840 government control you even when things
00:17:54.160 don't even make sense like in California
00:17:56.559 they made flavored Vapes
00:17:59.039 illegal can you imagine you're like
00:18:01.320 strawberry mist is our number one
00:18:02.799 problem that was fine but they let it
00:18:05.039 also hurt black people in that it
00:18:07.720 counted Menthol as a flavor and hurt
00:18:10.200 Newports so you can't sell menthol
00:18:12.640 cigarettes in California right they have
00:18:14.720 their own cigarettes they have non
00:18:17.159 Menthol Newports it's terrible why do
00:18:20.120 black people like Menthol so much what's
00:18:22.600 that
00:18:24.840 about it's a totally different type of
00:18:27.039 cigarette you're going to get me
00:18:28.520 cancelled um this is very racist this
00:18:31.520 conversation even even though neither of
00:18:34.400 us are go just talking about a type of
00:18:38.919 saying just saying why do black people
00:18:41.240 like Newport so much and a black and a
00:18:44.280 black person actually getting ready to
00:18:46.320 answer this H it's terrible on all ends
00:18:50.200 um I don't think it is well I don't
00:18:52.000 think it is either because we have a a
00:18:54.480 new it's like if you started asking me
00:18:55.880 about spaghetti I'm not going to get
00:18:57.520 offended
00:18:58.840 you started asking me about Italian food
00:19:00.520 or why why are Italian people so loud
00:19:03.240 I'm not not going to get how many people
00:19:05.080 have ever died of pasta
00:19:07.440 related a lot Joe a lot of fatos out
00:19:10.600 there kicking the bucket bro that's not
00:19:12.840 cuz of pasta has an overabundance of
00:19:14.600 carbohydrates they were going to be fat
00:19:16.200 wherever they lived sir maybe that's an
00:19:18.520 over great bread eaters in delicious
00:19:21.000 High carbohydrate food they couldn't
00:19:23.320 stop it people are addicted to food like
00:19:24.760 they're addicted to anything and if
00:19:25.960 there's a thing that I could ever be
00:19:27.440 addicted to it's that right that's all
00:19:30.000 of us though all of us and what a
00:19:32.240 blessing yeah we have so much starving
00:19:35.120 people are addicted to anything and they
00:19:37.640 don't have food related illnesses
00:19:40.000 exactly exactly back to where we were
00:19:43.360 yeah you were asking about about the
00:19:46.240 menthol cigarettes and and the answer
00:19:50.360 is
00:19:57.240 um
00:19:59.200 we value strength in
00:20:03.360 product so there's this whole thing with
00:20:07.200 liquor and malt liquor and the
00:20:10.480 difference between the two and one is
00:20:13.120 richer and stronger and the more potent
00:20:17.159 version right and as that makes as a
00:20:19.960 people we tend to go with those products
00:20:24.840 things are stronger that makes sense
00:20:26.480 right like before things were called
00:20:28.200 called
00:20:29.120 concentrate yeah that's what we
00:20:32.360 appreciate that makes sense
00:20:34.919 concentrated and the fact that
00:20:39.240 um menal is a natural thing so you know
00:20:45.880 anybody who is from the south knows
00:20:49.159 about mint plants and you know and
00:20:52.880 Menthol used as a skin care product like
00:20:56.080 injuries and [ __ ] right like you
00:20:58.280 appreciate that as a flavor profile as
00:21:01.120 well right you know that makes sense the
00:21:04.320 mint
00:21:05.679 julip it's just telling people they
00:21:08.520 can't have that anymore who the [ __ ] are
00:21:10.720 you that's my position well and that's a
00:21:15.400 a noble position and we appreciate the
00:21:17.600 fact that you represent that but the
00:21:19.360 truth of the matter is not pretty and
00:21:21.840 the truth of the matter is that most
00:21:23.799 people would like to be controlled more
00:21:26.400 by their government if they make it
00:21:29.039 easier maybe most people are all for
00:21:32.120 government control as long as they don't
00:21:34.600 have to discuss it yeah as long as it
00:21:37.679 works in their favor they'll give up a
00:21:40.039 lot of Rights and then hopefully the
00:21:42.440 next Administration that's right
00:21:44.279 generally worthless at the time
00:21:47.520 yeah well there's a lot of people that
00:21:49.799 if the government could make life easy a
00:21:51.440 lot of people have it hard right so the
00:21:53.120 government comes in and says I'm going
00:21:54.360 to make it easier for you but I'm going
00:21:56.240 to need certain requirements of you I'm
00:21:58.120 going to need you to have a digital ID
00:22:00.279 that digital ID will be attached to a
00:22:01.840 social credit score and we're going to
00:22:04.400 give you Universal basic income you no
00:22:06.919 longer have to worry about food or
00:22:09.159 shelter you'll be taken care of and now
00:22:11.240 you can pursue your dreams is this the
00:22:13.039 mark of the beast speaking of sir I
00:22:15.080 think it is right that's the whole thing
00:22:17.600 is it's never been difficult at any
00:22:20.279 point in history like like we got a dude
00:22:23.720 right now that's telling you front and
00:22:25.640 center that I put a computer in
00:22:28.200 somebody's head guys right like yeah and
00:22:32.520 everybody's going yay it's the greatest
00:22:35.120 thing in the world sir yeah but we
00:22:38.279 understood this 15 20 25 years ago we
00:22:43.080 understood while watching Tron or while
00:22:45.679 watching cyborgs we understood that
00:22:48.640 there was just this small line medically
00:22:52.200 that needed to be crossed in order for
00:22:54.520 us to be able to do these things yeah
00:22:57.120 like if you can hook up battery up to a
00:22:59.120 octopus and make it go like this you're
00:23:01.440 halfway
00:23:03.320 there yeah why because this this is a
00:23:07.960 this is a machine that we have it's a
00:23:11.120 biological machine right and once you
00:23:13.360 understand it you understand it yeah and
00:23:15.799 you could [ __ ] with that machine you
00:23:17.480 could Juice It Up you could [ __ ] get
00:23:19.039 it stronger get it smarter you do a lot
00:23:21.360 of things with that machine this is what
00:23:22.840 the anunaki said this is how you know
00:23:26.559 that these are not made up things from
00:23:28.840 people's
00:23:29.960 imagination because everything is too
00:23:32.960 factual like like this necklace right
00:23:36.279 people online were like yeah is that
00:23:38.360 Buddhist or that's uh this or that it
00:23:40.720 it's none of that like like I just try
00:23:43.520 to find the answers to things so I I is
00:23:46.080 that a ship wheel I designed this
00:23:48.520 because this is that thing that you see
00:23:51.600 that all the anunaki guys that have that
00:23:54.200 look like a richz watch and they always
00:23:57.320 have it in you're always trying to see
00:23:59.520 what that is what is that it is a time
00:24:03.400 and it's a
00:24:05.320 compass it's a timekeeping compass
00:24:08.640 that's what that is yeah
00:24:11.320 so that's what made the
00:24:15.400 carrier of great
00:24:17.679 importance because he was able to do
00:24:21.279 things that were magical in nature like
00:24:23.960 go somewhere and get right back
00:24:29.200 like you know what I mean like that that
00:24:31.080 thing on the wrist was a compass a time
00:24:34.840 keeping a time keeping Compass yeah a
00:24:39.919 oh right
00:24:42.039 so you had to believe in things that
00:24:45.200 didn't exist at some point like
00:24:48.200 magnetics and um distance
00:24:54.360 and probabilities and
00:24:59.760 right right that's how
00:25:04.720 like if you if you were to read like
00:25:07.720 thousands of books about people that
00:25:10.960 knew a bunch of [ __ ] like you start
00:25:13.840 finding out that it's not really about
00:25:16.080 knowing anything it's about where to go
00:25:18.640 to get the information you know what I
00:25:20.880 mean yeah
00:25:22.760 um so like when we look at all the ruins
00:25:25.880 all around the world like we're not
00:25:28.159 seeing ruins of colleges and
00:25:31.360 universities and all of that we're
00:25:34.679 seeing temples and synagogues and
00:25:37.520 churches and but people don't understand
00:25:41.399 that that's where that information was
00:25:43.880 coming from for that period of time when
00:25:47.200 we went to these temples they weren't in
00:25:50.200 there singing and reading from a book
00:25:53.240 they were in there being taught things
00:25:55.799 that they were able to go put in into
00:25:58.200 practice you see what I'm saying like
00:26:00.360 they were being taught our agriculture
00:26:03.279 you know what I mean like they were
00:26:04.679 being
00:26:06.080 taught yeah yeah they had some very
00:26:09.799 bizarre knowledge too they had a
00:26:11.760 detailed knowledge of cosmology they
00:26:14.360 they they had a really detailed
00:26:16.279 knowledge of our solar system 100% of
00:26:19.200 the writings across the world whoever
00:26:22.720 said anything about space or the
00:26:25.799 universe or what was out there
00:26:28.240 why were all of them correct Joe it's
00:26:31.159 not even possible
00:26:34.480 like how did they know that Mars was the
00:26:38.159 red planet and why was it a worldwide
00:26:41.960 fact right planetar that Saturn had
00:26:46.200 Rings like based upon what information
00:26:51.799 because nobody worldwide is
00:26:55.039 disagreeing nobody's like Oh I thought
00:26:57.600 thought of this or I it came to me in
00:26:59.399 aam nobody's saying that anywhere in
00:27:02.240 anybody's civilization everybody's
00:27:05.320 civilization says this information came
00:27:08.120 from the people that came from there
00:27:10.320 yeah there like there are no
00:27:13.080 coincidences well they know that Mars
00:27:15.000 used to have an
00:27:16.960 atmosphere Mars used to have an
00:27:18.760 atmosphere used to have water something
00:27:21.559 happened to its environment if if that's
00:27:23.399 correct then there's a guy right now
00:27:25.159 saying he's getting ready put people up
00:27:26.919 there yep exactly restarted all over
00:27:30.559 again 50 years ago there was no water in
00:27:33.440 our whole universe let them tell it now
00:27:36.520 there's been water almost everywhere
00:27:38.200 there's water on the moon for crying out
00:27:39.880 are you familiar with the younger drias
00:27:42.000 impact
00:27:43.000 Theory do you know what that is say what
00:27:45.840 it younger gas impact theory is a theory
00:27:48.279 that earth goes through a cycle of like
00:27:50.360 Comet storms every June and every
00:27:52.640 November and most of the time nothing
00:27:54.760 happens but every now and again we get
00:27:56.960 hit we we get hit big and they think we
00:27:59.320 got hit big
00:28:00.960 11,800 plus years ago and that that had
00:28:04.399 to restart civilization and that what
00:28:06.760 you're seeing from like Mesopotamia all
00:28:08.679 these people 6,000 years later they
00:28:10.840 think that is a rebuilding of
00:28:12.519 civilization that was already like just
00:28:14.360 Whispers and stories and tales and then
00:28:16.519 they rebuilt it again thousands of years
00:28:18.760 later but if you go back to like 11,800
00:28:21.799 BC 11,800 years ago you're you're
00:28:24.679 dealing with what we thought were hunter
00:28:26.200 gatherers and now we know they w
00:28:28.120 now we know they built complex stone
00:28:29.679 structures and the real speculation is
00:28:32.360 they think that the people who built the
00:28:34.120 pyramids built them way earlier than the
00:28:37.600 conventional dating is they think
00:28:39.760 there's real evidence that shows they're
00:28:41.279 9,000 11,000 years old easy no people
00:28:44.600 built the pyramids No people no who
00:28:46.960 built
00:28:47.960 them no people built the pyramids and if
00:28:51.080 you and if you look around the world you
00:28:53.640 see certain Telltale things that let you
00:28:56.360 know that Advanced Machinery was in
00:28:59.799 usage look
00:29:02.320 there this whole thing where slaves are
00:29:05.200 stronger people is a fallacy we like to
00:29:09.159 believe that slaves are stronger slaves
00:29:12.159 are weaker because they don't eat the
00:29:14.679 right food and they live a terrible life
00:29:17.760 um your slave population is not smarter
00:29:21.120 and better condition unless you're
00:29:23.559 enslaving the je they stopped thinking
00:29:25.679 that quite a while ago they think it was
00:29:27.440 actually skilled labor because the way
00:29:29.240 they were eating they found what their
00:29:31.279 camps were where their food was they ate
00:29:33.720 like very good food so they think they
00:29:35.480 were actually skilled labor but also
00:29:37.440 probably Force skilled labor but that's
00:29:40.120 probably not the people built it that's
00:29:42.159 probably the people that were working on
00:29:43.480 it that's the probably the people that
00:29:44.880 worked in the village or in the in you
00:29:46.880 know in the city how many companies have
00:29:49.960 done Renovations on the White House none
00:29:53.360 of them have done enough renovation that
00:29:55.640 they can claim it's their White House
00:29:57.799 house so yes thousands of years worth of
00:30:01.440 people were there but that doesn't have
00:30:04.679 anything to do with the building of it
00:30:06.320 who do you think built it well
00:30:08.799 understand we we know enough now to
00:30:11.080 understand that this was a complex this
00:30:13.840 was not um right we've been led to
00:30:17.880 believe that this is how much they
00:30:21.279 worshiped their dead bodies
00:30:24.360 right but the evidence doesn't show any
00:30:27.799 of that like like when you see inside
00:30:30.399 when they have those intricate carvings
00:30:32.360 and paintings and stuff in gold and
00:30:34.519 stuff you have to remember this is in a
00:30:36.960 windowless room folks there's no candle
00:30:40.880 Su there's no
00:30:43.640 this uh it it's clearly a power plant
00:30:47.440 and built specifically for that location
00:30:51.600 on this planet for what do you think it
00:30:53.960 was powered by um the um hot water
00:30:59.480 Springs underneath it so it was powered
00:31:02.760 by the hot water
00:31:05.639 Springs and to but what to what end how
00:31:08.240 do you know all this first of all is
00:31:10.120 this marijuana talk I I don't think
00:31:13.679 so um this is um where did you read
00:31:19.639 this if you if you follow information
00:31:23.399 about humankind you find out that in all
00:31:26.799 parts of of history people were coming
00:31:29.600 to this region for their information and
00:31:32.600 their knowledge and their things that
00:31:34.919 were forbidden and there these these
00:31:38.240 were not um these were the highest of
00:31:42.399 human civilization not even comparable
00:31:45.600 to anyone else nor since nor s now or
00:31:49.080 yeah nor since right the great par is
00:31:51.639 insane right like ins even Tesla says
00:31:56.039 that this is where he came came to get
00:31:57.559 the information but if you follow that
00:31:59.279 information pathway um it leads you to
00:32:02.799 this character called th right and The
00:32:07.279 Emerald
00:32:09.320 Tablets um of th are literally
00:32:14.039 mind changing and
00:32:17.200 mindblowing just because you understand
00:32:20.240 when this was
00:32:21.679 written
00:32:23.559 and the terminology being used is um
00:32:29.120 when was it written far too accurate for
00:32:31.960 now
00:32:34.360 so
00:32:37.440 uh I'm I'm sure
00:32:40.120 that here it
00:32:42.120 is Emerald
00:32:44.559 Tablet also known as the
00:32:48.000 smar smar dine smar dine tablet or the
00:32:52.559 tabula
00:32:54.320 smar
00:32:55.880 smar what I [ __ ] that up uh it's a
00:32:59.240 compact
00:33:00.960 Maes yeah a cryptic hermetic text it was
00:33:04.559 highly regarded by Islamic and European
00:33:06.279 Alchemists as the foundation of their
00:33:08.200 art though attributed to the legendary
00:33:10.720 helenistic figure Hermes Tri Tris megus
00:33:14.720 how do you say it bro how you say Tris
00:33:16.600 mesus Trish mesus the text the Emerald
00:33:19.720 Tablet first appears in a number of
00:33:21.200 early medeval Arabic sources the oldest
00:33:24.639 of which dates to the late 8th or early
00:33:26.600 9th Century it was translated into Latin
00:33:28.639 several times in the 12th and 13th
00:33:30.240 centuries numerous interpretations and
00:33:32.679 commentaries followed so what does it
00:33:34.240 say though the Egyptian god tho okay it
00:33:38.080 says beginning in the 2 Century BC
00:33:40.200 onwards Greek texts attributed to Hermes
00:33:43.960 uh a syncretic combination of Greek God
00:33:46.559 Hermes and the Egyptian god tho appeared
00:33:49.200 in Greco Roman Egypt those text knows
00:33:52.440 known as the hermetica are heterogenous
00:33:56.080 het heterogeneous collection of works
00:33:58.960 that in the modern day era are commonly
00:34:01.320 subdivided into two groups the technical
00:34:03.880 hermetica compromizing of
00:34:06.559 astrological medical Botanical
00:34:09.239 alchemical and magical writings and the
00:34:12.480 religio philosophical hermetica
00:34:15.480 comprising of mystical philosophical
00:34:18.000 writings holy [ __ ] is this weed talk
00:34:20.599 Joseph no this is so legit so legit my
00:34:24.119 man so this dude was probably an alien
00:34:28.119 dude first of all there are no
00:34:30.159 probablies yeah that's the benefit once
00:34:32.639 you hear it or read it um is the fact
00:34:37.199 that it's given in first person and
00:34:39.560 that's not possible the things that are
00:34:41.800 being said are impossible enough time
00:34:44.879 has passed though that it's not like
00:34:47.960 that but I'm going to read that he
00:34:50.918 literally
00:34:52.000 says hey there's a spaceship on Earth
00:34:54.839 and this is where it is
00:34:59.400 because if all you care about is
00:35:03.040 information right like that's what you
00:35:06.359 start to see is when you get to
00:35:08.640 everybody's civilization Asian Indian
00:35:12.640 African when you get to the Crux of
00:35:15.560 their
00:35:17.160 information nobody's disagreeing with
00:35:19.920 anybody
00:35:22.520 right if you figured out who how the
00:35:26.119 [ __ ] they did it
00:35:29.040 if there was any logical explanation
00:35:31.040 that people could have done it I would
00:35:33.040 be on board I'd be like well okay but
00:35:36.839 there aren't any people saying that in
00:35:39.599 human beings can there are it's possible
00:35:41.880 if you had enough power and you had
00:35:43.200 enough engineering and Mathematics that
00:35:45.119 you could figure out how to design and
00:35:47.800 construct the pyramid yes but then the
00:35:50.280 logistical problem of getting the stones
00:35:53.079 from hundreds of miles away massive
00:35:56.520 massive massive several ton up to 80 ton
00:35:59.880 Stones Joe that's crazy 500 miles away
00:36:03.240 some of them even if you could do it let
00:36:04.599 me ask you this would you build it on
00:36:08.960 Sand I don't think it was originally
00:36:11.160 sand so that's the thing right this was
00:36:13.520 a fertile Valley yeah it was yeah the
00:36:16.240 Nile Valley the reason they had electric
00:36:18.839 and WiFi and they had all of that they
00:36:23.040 probably did and that's probably where
00:36:25.720 the younger dry s Theory comes in the
00:36:27.960 greatest trick is to make us believe
00:36:30.319 that people back then were dumber and
00:36:33.720 we're smarter right and that whole thing
00:36:36.400 is a fallacy yeah that's definitely not
00:36:38.520 real but it's worth it for us to believe
00:36:43.359 that I think we are the the children of
00:36:46.359 the survivors of some great catastrophe
00:36:49.680 and I think that's why every
00:36:51.960 single biblical scholar what not
00:36:54.720 everybody some people what do you mean
00:36:57.040 are that some people are the survivors
00:36:59.920 right well I mean most human beings
00:37:03.280 probably got wiped out in Comet storms
00:37:06.119 and I think we probably got there's been
00:37:08.440 points in history that they know of
00:37:10.000 where human beings got down to like
00:37:11.359 7,000 people who's counting
00:37:14.680 them I think they use genetics and they
00:37:17.640 back trace and they try to find
00:37:19.800 individuals that were capable of having
00:37:21.680 x amount of children I wonder how they
00:37:23.160 do the calculations it's a good question
00:37:24.880 the things in Hollywood
00:37:27.280 and in writing that have attracted our
00:37:30.160 attention worldwide were all based on
00:37:33.359 some truth so all the stories of Hobbits
00:37:37.880 and have been successful in all of their
00:37:40.960 genres why because they existed like
00:37:45.960 like we now know that there were whole
00:37:48.640 pygmy groups and that you know we
00:37:51.880 understand that that's what the Seven
00:37:54.240 Dwarves was yeah like that island of
00:37:57.880 Flores man that they
00:38:00.000 found the they literally call it a
00:38:02.400 hobbit it was like a three- foot tall
00:38:03.760 person that was covered in hair smaller
00:38:06.720 head than us used
00:38:09.960 tools a as a as a
00:38:14.720 pre-teen I knew that Atlantis really
00:38:19.960 existed just because of how it was
00:38:23.319 spoken of
00:38:25.359 offhandedly M
00:38:27.200 mhm just that it was known early
00:38:29.640 writings
00:38:31.480 yeah well not just
00:38:34.880 mentioned but mentioned offhandedly like
00:38:37.839 you would a place that's just a landmark
00:38:40.920 right we landed in New York before we
00:38:42.560 went to Montreal yeah we were in Austin
00:38:46.160 by Dallas right
00:38:49.960 exactly yeah yeah have you ever seen the
00:38:53.880 the guy that thinks that they found the
00:38:55.520 spot in a Africa what is that uh that
00:38:59.319 the ring
00:39:01.760 called that Jimmy corsetti is uh he's on
00:39:05.960 this this dude is an expert in this [ __ ]
00:39:08.280 and he's an expert in uh ancient
00:39:10.720 catastrophes and and the remnants and
00:39:13.560 the evidence that shows that these
00:39:14.960 civilizations existed and something
00:39:16.640 happened and he's focused on this one
00:39:19.440 area in Africa that he believes is
00:39:23.040 Atlantis and he says it has all the
00:39:25.760 Hallmark character istics and there's
00:39:28.079 all the evidence of massive water
00:39:31.280 erosion surrounding the area that one
00:39:34.800 point in time it's very likely that this
00:39:38.160 area got hit with a massive flood and it
00:39:39.920 matches all the characteristics of atlan
00:39:42.560 when you see it when you see the way the
00:39:44.960 the concentric circles of rings like try
00:39:47.200 explaining this like you're going to see
00:39:49.280 it and try explaining this through a
00:39:50.960 natural phenomena that doesn't exist
00:39:52.480 anywhere around it right concentric
00:39:54.839 circles that is near what used to be
00:39:57.680 water and there's heavy water erosion
00:40:00.480 marks all around it that indicate
00:40:03.440 massive amounts of quick flowing water
00:40:05.480 in a very short period of time right
00:40:08.599 yeah uh I forget what it's called but I
00:40:10.480 know exactly where it is it's right here
00:40:12.079 you can zoom in that's it look at that
00:40:14.839 thing bro are you [ __ ] kidding
00:40:18.200 me the reshot structure that's it the
00:40:21.079 reshot
00:40:22.400 structure I mean are you [ __ ] kidding
00:40:24.560 me I think if you go 3D can see
00:40:27.640 the now imagine if that was this massive
00:40:31.040 city of concentric circles and walls and
00:40:34.200 a thriving population and then it gets
00:40:36.640 hit with this water you can see the
00:40:38.200 water erosion all over the place the
00:40:41.240 whole thing looks like it's washed out
00:40:43.119 see it yeah it looks like it was washed
00:40:45.800 out cuz it was right that's salt I
00:40:48.599 believe but that's what there's salt
00:40:50.240 there that's the other thing between
00:40:52.480 this and
00:40:54.000 the Garden of Eden
00:40:58.079 locations like these are the
00:41:00.920 two these are two of the great landmarks
00:41:05.119 in uh human history Where's the Garden
00:41:07.760 of
00:41:08.440 Eden well when you read the stories
00:41:11.720 right the the thing that strikes you is
00:41:14.720 that it's so specific like it says
00:41:18.720 things in talking about the Garden of
00:41:21.800 Eden that wait a minute if I can't find
00:41:25.560 what you're talking talking about this
00:41:27.960 isn't even real you see what I'm saying
00:41:30.839 like like where the Garden of Eden was
00:41:35.319 there's I think four rivers that come
00:41:38.400 from
00:41:39.200 it and then it names two of them
00:41:43.599 like I don't want to be specific because
00:41:46.520 at least he's going to bring it up but
00:41:47.920 it's like the Nile in the Euphrates
00:41:49.880 right right so you know two of them and
00:41:52.960 it's saying you
00:41:54.760 know where the for meat this is where it
00:41:58.280 is and
00:42:01.319 um yeah my whole life I was
00:42:07.040 like this this is really weird because
00:42:09.720 at one period of time we're thinking no
00:42:11.680 flood happens there so many things that
00:42:14.400 have lined up from these great religious
00:42:17.960 books to where we can see that no
00:42:21.079 something happened here like something
00:42:23.000 happened and these are stories of people
00:42:25.160 telling stories that have told to them
00:42:27.040 for about a thousand years wrot this why
00:42:30.079 right this is why they were told and
00:42:32.319 that's what you that's the difference
00:42:34.359 between those of us that
00:42:37.640 um want to know the world's Mysteries
00:42:41.400 and
00:42:42.480 conspiracy theorist like there's nothing
00:42:46.000 to a
00:42:47.440 conspiracy theorist because you're not
00:42:49.720 producing what you're using but these
00:42:52.440 World Mysteries like um that's harder to
00:42:57.240 do a a lie is not something that people
00:43:00.760 are going to repeat for Generations on
00:43:04.000 Generations it's being repeated like
00:43:06.520 that because people have reason to
00:43:08.839 believe it to be true and and um as you
00:43:13.319 go through history you see that um those
00:43:16.800 are the stories that we still talk about
00:43:19.119 but they're still valid like the there
00:43:22.000 were writings that the African Doan
00:43:25.119 tribe is mhm like like like from like
00:43:29.720 the serious star system like they're
00:43:31.559 saying very specific things and for
00:43:35.720 hundreds of years we're
00:43:38.880 going you guys are idiots you don't know
00:43:41.480 what you're talking about right like
00:43:43.800 somebody will have a fake Star Story
00:43:47.000 right you see right and now we get to
00:43:49.280 the point where we can actually see what
00:43:51.520 they were talking about what if we find
00:43:53.280 out that we're
00:43:54.480 aliens that we were just is dropped off
00:43:57.319 here a long ass time the Adam and Eve
00:44:00.079 story is the the story of the place
00:44:02.079 where they created us I'm sure we're the
00:44:04.559 only people in the universe that think
00:44:07.040 like that you think
00:44:10.400 so why do you think
00:44:13.640 that
00:44:15.240 um no no portion of humankind's story
00:44:20.720 differs from
00:44:22.800 that it's all creation story like if you
00:44:26.880 go that's why NASA and space force are
00:44:31.240 not more forthcoming because the further
00:44:35.280 you get in Space the more obvious [ __ ]
00:44:38.079 is like once you're up there and you're
00:44:41.720 looking down this [ __ ] doesn't look like
00:44:45.240 there is no God it looks like you're in
00:44:47.520 the middle of somebody's workshop and
00:44:49.920 they just showed you every single way
00:44:52.640 that every Star can be made every single
00:44:55.960 SLE way a planet can be made every way
00:44:59.160 that a black hole can be a Galaxy a
00:45:02.400 universe and then showed you the best of
00:45:04.800 the
00:45:08.760 best it's the spot I mean in our solar
00:45:13.680 system we're the best neighborhood
00:45:15.920 that's ever existed they all suck every
00:45:19.400 other planet
00:45:22.839 sucks we're rudimentary enough that we
00:45:26.280 still require environmental help right
00:45:30.200 until you get that chip once you get
00:45:32.200 that chip each point it would be like it
00:45:34.280 would be like saying people that um
00:45:36.559 didn't learn how to ride
00:45:38.920 horses they were
00:45:41.400 slow like they couldn't run fast enough
00:45:43.839 so they got horses right no it didn't
00:45:46.680 have anything to do with that better is
00:45:49.440 better that's that's really what it's
00:45:51.599 going to be better is better we're all
00:45:53.160 going to integrate like we would we we
00:45:55.920 would have told you 30 years ago that we
00:45:57.839 wouldn't need a space force unless we
00:45:59.880 went up there and found
00:46:01.599 something I think the space force the
00:46:03.720 idea is that they're worried about it's
00:46:05.760 not an idea someone else being in space
00:46:07.760 first with weapons flying around you
00:46:10.640 mean us yeah well if we can do it they
00:46:14.119 can do it that's the thing who is they
00:46:16.680 whoever it is no China there's only
00:46:19.040 humankind an alien oh I agree the
00:46:22.680 problem is this is what we really need
00:46:24.720 we really need this neural link to lock
00:46:26.920 us all together so everybody could read
00:46:29.319 everybody's mind that's what's going to
00:46:31.680 happen and then there's going to be no
00:46:32.880 more leaders there's going to be no more
00:46:34.520 governments you're being very
00:46:35.880 controversial right now okay so look
00:46:39.160 that that better is better that exists
00:46:41.520 already so just understand that
00:46:46.280 um the worldwide government is way
00:46:50.000 smarter than we give them credit for
00:46:52.520 because we they have us believing they
00:46:55.119 don't do nothing
00:46:56.440 but the truth is like like there's no
00:46:59.280 such thing as the government um is in
00:47:01.880 bed with the internet no the internet is
00:47:05.119 a government
00:47:06.800 installation that they allowed the world
00:47:09.880 to use for
00:47:12.680 free so that they could have the
00:47:16.520 information willingly because you're on
00:47:19.680 it that's what it became exactly but I
00:47:23.319 think what it the think
00:47:26.319 yes I think the progression of
00:47:27.640 Technology often times lead leads itself
00:47:30.359 to like even cell phones at first it was
00:47:32.640 Michael Douglas walking on the beach in
00:47:34.599 Wall Street looking looking amazing with
00:47:36.920 that brick carrying that big brick like
00:47:38.960 look at that guy he's got a phone with
00:47:40.800 no cord he's out on the beach this is
00:47:43.079 insane to everybody having a phone yeah
00:47:45.720 but not to everybody because those in
00:47:48.680 the ham radio community and people with
00:47:52.000 the CBS they didn't feel like that was
00:47:55.000 cutting Ed because it really wasn't like
00:47:58.480 like it's still cutting to to walk
00:48:00.359 around with a device it's a leaping
00:48:02.680 technology here's the thing when you
00:48:04.599 look at all of our inventions that's
00:48:06.960 when you know that these um space
00:48:10.720 encounters were real because we only
00:48:14.000 have advancement in a couple of
00:48:17.280 Industries in the world and everything
00:48:21.319 else is nothing so um like the micro
00:48:25.839 wave that they had 30 years ago it it
00:48:28.960 looks the same as the same microwave now
00:48:31.359 why because it wasn't it was done as a
00:48:33.800 military thing it was supposed to be a
00:48:35.319 weapon and then they found out you know
00:48:37.960 it heats up food and they put a door on
00:48:39.640 it and so it hasn't changed at all
00:48:45.000 because invention is very
00:48:48.000 difficult and
00:48:51.119 um do you do you subscribe to the idea
00:48:53.799 that we get back engineered absolutely
00:48:56.799 that's why those leaps we don't see
00:48:59.559 those leaps in anything else is my point
00:49:02.440 like like yeah there's so much
00:49:06.160 speculation about the creation of uh a
00:49:10.319 bunch of different things that came out
00:49:11.599 of Roswell fiber optics right but
00:49:14.400 remember 20 years ago 15 years ago this
00:49:17.720 is crazy talk crazy
00:49:19.559 talk but it's not like it's at the point
00:49:23.680 at at this point like
00:49:27.799 Area 51 would have to be doing something
00:49:32.520 they were definitely doing something
00:49:33.920 right and nobody's telling a differing
00:49:36.599 story as to what it is right like people
00:49:39.400 have great imaginations all through
00:49:41.839 history they could make up something the
00:49:44.319 only damning information is if you read
00:49:47.599 3,000 accounts of of these entities and
00:49:53.000 realize wait a minute why is everybody
00:49:57.520 describing the same couple of beings
00:50:01.559 right like there's
00:50:03.319 no right there's no outliers like every
00:50:07.720 there's like three different things they
00:50:10.359 describe yeah they describe they said
00:50:12.720 that is the documented 8 to 12 we're not
00:50:16.280 talking about English-speaking people
00:50:19.079 we're talking about worldwide right like
00:50:22.440 that's what is striking indigenous
00:50:24.599 people in Australia drew
00:50:26.640 them
00:50:31.200 yeah right nobody's saying anything
00:50:33.920 outlandish and that's what you get to
00:50:36.880 when
00:50:37.760 you go religiously MH
00:50:43.280 or well the alien thing is a bit of a
00:50:45.680 religion to a lot of folks they they
00:50:47.839 don't want to believe anything it's a
00:50:49.359 necessary component yeah whatever
00:50:52.160 religion you're a part of at some point
00:50:54.839 it said is you were contacted that there
00:50:58.319 was a fight in heaven and you
00:51:02.240 know this happened and that happened yep
00:51:05.440 every single one of them everyone
00:51:08.079 without nobody's telling a different
00:51:10.720 story everybody's telling the same
00:51:14.960 stories yeah like that's how you know
00:51:18.240 that um vagina and gold are Universal
00:51:25.880 things because in everybody's story none
00:51:29.520 of these otherw worldly interests
00:51:33.079 entities had any interest in anything
00:51:36.359 other than
00:51:38.119 women um and gold right [ __ ] or gold
00:51:42.760 like because and and you understand that
00:51:45.480 now when you start learning about what's
00:51:47.640 in space because you can see that any
00:51:50.880 element or any commodity that we sell
00:51:53.680 here is abundant in space like trash
00:51:58.880 um you know they found one meteor that
00:52:02.880 was worth all the money on Earth yeah
00:52:09.079 770
00:52:10.640 billion trillion it was another number
00:52:13.359 some crazy right right yeah wow yeah
00:52:18.920 they know that there's there's spots in
00:52:22.760 space that have abundant minerals that
00:52:24.839 are very valuable and the the the thing
00:52:27.040 about the um the Samaran story The
00:52:29.400 Samaran Tech story rail out story may
00:52:32.079 make everyone a billionaire on this
00:52:33.480 Earth everyone would be a
00:52:36.480 billionaire every person would earn
00:52:38.640 seven several billion dollars it so it
00:52:42.200 sounds jokey right but understand
00:52:44.680 somebody got this contract like they
00:52:47.200 broke this up into several worldwide
00:52:49.799 contracts like 10,000 quadrillion it's
00:52:53.799 just there but here's here's the thing
00:52:55.880 if you got that much gold is gold
00:52:57.520 valuable anymore cuz one of the things
00:52:59.119 about gold is that there's not that much
00:53:00.520 of it you know if you look at you ever
00:53:02.559 seen the number of gold on earth that's
00:53:04.520 not necessary in capitalism they showed
00:53:07.280 us that with diamonds this is true they
00:53:09.680 can hide it it is about the perception
00:53:12.079 of things and um if I buy up all of
00:53:15.599 something it is rare now immediately
00:53:18.760 right just because I have control of all
00:53:20.720 of it and that is worth killing Tesla
00:53:23.880 over mhm and that's
00:53:27.760 why the people are still in business in
00:53:30.680 Hollywood because everything's a
00:53:32.920 commodity did you ever read um you ever
00:53:35.640 heard of Zechariah
00:53:37.280 siten Zechariah sitchin was a Biblical
00:53:40.079 scholar who uh he deciphered the
00:53:43.200 Sumerian text and he was like an expert
00:53:46.359 in language and when he deciphered he
00:53:49.599 might not have been a Biblical scholar
00:53:51.000 might just have been a language expert
00:53:52.599 but either way he deciphered these texts
00:53:55.480 and wrote these books about the real
00:53:59.000 meaning behind everything they were
00:54:00.200 saying and he said that the reason why
00:54:02.720 we are so fascinated with gold is that
00:54:04.960 the Anunnaki literally would have us
00:54:07.480 mine gold for them because they needed
00:54:09.240 it to protect their atmosphere so what
00:54:12.559 they would do is take gold which is a
00:54:14.400 very rare um in what it does what gold
00:54:18.440 can do is you can take a little piece of
00:54:19.760 gold like this big and coat this entire
00:54:21.799 table it's real weird right so very and
00:54:24.720 you could turned into a fine dust and
00:54:27.000 they suspended this fine dust in their
00:54:29.079 atmosphere to protect them from a a
00:54:31.480 degrading atmosphere cuz they're getting
00:54:33.440 global warming or whatever everybody
00:54:35.839 that was he wrote about this in the 70s
00:54:38.520 EV it doesn't matter because everybody
00:54:42.240 in Egypt knew
00:54:44.599 it like this is where the
00:54:48.839 Alchemy um yeah that's where it all
00:54:51.200 originated right we don't even know what
00:54:53.400 they knew none of those people people
00:54:55.240 are saying hey I came up with this [ __ ]
00:54:57.680 they're saying right somebody gave it to
00:54:59.240 us somebody who came from this place
00:55:02.720 here came and told us that this is how
00:55:05.960 this goes and this is what this is worth
00:55:09.079 because I'm saying
00:55:12.119 um the people that were being abused in
00:55:16.040 the minds going to get the
00:55:18.319 diamonds it was it wasn't like that for
00:55:20.799 them it was just them getting these
00:55:22.319 rocks and this crazy guy's going to pay
00:55:24.480 a days wages for us to gather rocks
00:55:27.160 let's gather them right you know this
00:55:30.920 is but when you follow back it's all
00:55:33.960 about the information and and at the top
00:55:37.119 of it nobody's trying to claim it like
00:55:40.359 nobody's saying right I invented this
00:55:43.960 yeah yeah that is
00:55:45.920 wild if if imagine this that's why we're
00:55:49.039 getting most of our [ __ ] back engineered
00:55:51.720 stuff they leave for us we have to
00:55:54.200 figure it out sort through it the people
00:55:57.520 that have alien technology if they the
00:56:00.359 people that do have an alien craft that
00:56:02.240 they work on what a weird reality you
00:56:04.640 must live in the whole rest of the
00:56:06.520 world's got guessing and you got this
00:56:08.720 thing in front of you like oh is real we
00:56:11.640 have one I can show it to you that's how
00:56:14.520 everybody in space force will have to
00:56:16.480 feel right right they must how many of
00:56:19.480 you you think SE [ __ ] I'm saying how do
00:56:21.319 you think Elon mus really feels like I
00:56:24.440 don't think he's going tell you no I'm
00:56:26.000 saying in his head can he still have a
00:56:29.160 superhero or is he one of them oo you
00:56:32.760 know he's one of them like if you're the
00:56:36.119 richest dude in the world and you're
00:56:37.160 also a Super Genius how the [ __ ] do you
00:56:38.680 stop yourself from thinking you're a
00:56:39.920 superhero that's the big
00:56:41.559 question no it's not like that no no it
00:56:44.839 doesn't have S superhero side effects to
00:56:47.720 it I mean you would probably think like
00:56:50.400 the more you know the more you know how
00:56:53.400 little you know that's
00:56:55.680 there's not a you know what I mean and
00:56:57.960 nobody has ownership of information that
00:57:01.880 that's that's why um reading books moves
00:57:06.960 civilization because um like when I when
00:57:11.200 I said like you know I read 3,000 books
00:57:13.960 people were like yeah right but you know
00:57:17.200 every everything in life is about the
00:57:20.240 environment it it was grown in the petri
00:57:22.960 dish right so if I told you that from
00:57:26.280 the time I was 8 to the time I was 12 um
00:57:30.640 I never celebrated any birthdays I never
00:57:33.599 went to a birthday party I never had a
00:57:36.039 Thanksgiving a Christmas I never
00:57:38.559 trick-or treated I wasn't allowed to
00:57:41.119 watch movies and I wasn't allowed to
00:57:43.720 watch TV um all I could do was read if I
00:57:47.200 told you that then you will understand
00:57:49.520 that for eight hours a day I got eight
00:57:53.119 hours and I can read and and I love to
00:57:55.559 read and so I'm reading books that are
00:58:00.599 250 200 pages and it takes me about an
00:58:04.960 hour to read one so yeah an hour to read
00:58:08.920 PES a day yeah like all I'm doing is
00:58:12.280 reading cuz that's what so I'm I'm
00:58:14.559 checking out 20
00:58:16.520 books the limit at the library is 20
00:58:19.520 books at one time so I'm going Monday
00:58:22.920 Wednesday and Friday just just because
00:58:26.039 this is my thing like so you're getting
00:58:28.319 60 books a week ABS minimum because
00:58:32.119 really yeah because I'm reading more
00:58:34.000 than that because I still have religious
00:58:35.960 books that I have to read so under
00:58:39.079 understand this is pre- internet first
00:58:41.799 so understand that in Reading one thing
00:58:44.960 that I'm reading right right this one
00:58:48.240 thing that I'm reading is also requiring
00:58:51.480 me to have this
00:58:56.760 appendix book that is the Source book
00:59:00.520 that it's telling me it's getting these
00:59:03.480 things from and so I've got four books
00:59:07.440 open at a time just for this one book
00:59:11.960 like
00:59:16.920 um but yeah I'm so first I I guess
00:59:22.240 between 8 and 12 I'm only
00:59:25.520 I'm I'm a I can read Classics
00:59:28.920 and nonfiction so I'm saying no novels
00:59:32.680 or anything like that I'm just reading
00:59:36.400 the like time life has like 1,800 of
00:59:39.520 these individual books um on all
00:59:44.559 subjects of the world and um so you just
00:59:48.720 spent most of your time reading not most
00:59:51.920 all of it all of your time reading and
00:59:54.319 then when did it that was my thing
00:59:56.520 because
00:59:58.359 um
01:00:01.880 like like I was able to be in each of
01:00:05.760 these stories you follow what I'm saying
01:00:09.280 and and um I was getting so much
01:00:13.920 information like half of those I
01:00:15.799 probably had to write a one page report
01:00:19.799 on after you know but um yeah yeah that
01:00:24.880 was my whole thing and I the numbers
01:00:27.599 aren't even really accurate cuz I read
01:00:29.280 more than that because like sometimes
01:00:31.720 sometimes I would read something and I
01:00:33.240 wouldn't get it like like there was this
01:00:36.559 classic book called Little Women that I
01:00:39.160 probably read it four times cuz I just
01:00:42.039 didn't I didn't understand it and I knew
01:00:44.839 it was a classic
01:00:46.799 but I never read it what's it
01:00:50.920 about have you read it Jamie some little
01:00:53.319 women so kid out just I just watched an
01:00:55.160 episode of Kerber was there talking
01:00:56.520 about it what is the story about well I
01:00:59.760 here's the thing I don't know yeah right
01:01:01.880 right like four sisters think that okay
01:01:04.920 but
01:01:06.720 they they have money and
01:01:09.440 a an incredible circumstance but the
01:01:12.240 thing was I didn't have any sisters so I
01:01:14.760 didn't have anything to pull from and I
01:01:19.400 didn't have women in my life like that
01:01:22.520 so um yeah a lot of things I would have
01:01:25.599 to read multiple times for me to get
01:01:28.640 right to try to think how they thought
01:01:30.480 right well yeah like even like
01:01:32.680 um The Three Musketeers like I probably
01:01:35.920 read it three times because I you know
01:01:39.640 it was so I read it like the first time
01:01:42.280 to read it but then the next time I had
01:01:44.280 to read it again because these
01:01:46.000 characters were really distinct
01:01:48.440 characters and I couldn't figure out
01:01:50.640 wait a minute did this
01:01:52.200 happen really in history
01:01:54.960 or was somebody just this good at
01:01:57.799 telling this story of the you know but
01:02:01.720 um but it's things like that that leads
01:02:04.440 you to the kns Templar story which leads
01:02:08.160 you to you
01:02:10.200 know seeing how things through
01:02:14.119 history have remained you know what I
01:02:16.920 mean like
01:02:19.319 um all of that you get from the books
01:02:22.599 well history to me has always been the
01:02:24.160 most fascinating thing because you can't
01:02:27.200 quite imagine it you're trying to
01:02:29.119 imagine it you're piecing it together
01:02:31.119 listen to these stories and you just sit
01:02:32.880 back and go what the [ __ ] was that like
01:02:35.440 right is what we create every day yeah
01:02:39.319 yeah right yeah we're we're creating the
01:02:41.880 Futures version of what the [ __ ] was
01:02:43.440 that like this this place right here
01:02:46.119 freaks me out the most because this uh
01:02:49.000 this area specifically this area of
01:02:50.960 Texas the Hill Country was just all
01:02:53.559 Native Americans forever there's
01:02:56.480 thousands of arrowheads man look at here
01:02:58.920 my friend found this on his Ranch none
01:03:01.400 none of those people when we say those
01:03:04.319 people none of them picked a bad place
01:03:08.400 ever no that's when you understand that
01:03:11.160 there's a grid because nobody's holy
01:03:15.960 people picked bad spots everybody
01:03:19.359 understood certain things about the area
01:03:22.640 and long before they had x-ray machines
01:03:25.839 and yeah if you just went by that in the
01:03:29.599 whole world you would start to
01:03:33.160 understand
01:03:35.599 like the true power of the Vatican and
01:03:38.760 the fact that certain things are based
01:03:40.720 on real [ __ ] like the Arc of the
01:03:42.880 Covenant ain't some spooky little story
01:03:46.160 it's what do you think it is think it's
01:03:47.400 like a
01:03:48.279 nuclear generator or something like that
01:03:50.520 what do you think it is whatever the
01:03:53.000 nucleus is that would nuclearly power
01:03:56.000 something that would have initially been
01:03:58.839 in the pyramids would also have been in
01:04:01.400 the Ark of the Covenant which would be
01:04:03.400 the same thing it's something that you
01:04:05.760 can't [ __ ] with and it's radioactive and
01:04:08.279 it's very powerful still
01:04:11.079 has oh [ __ ] that's what I'm saying
01:04:13.960 nobody's telling any crazy stories my
01:04:16.760 man not globally no no every Everything
01:04:22.240 well gets less crazy every year it gets
01:04:25.000 less crazy every year 20 years ago
01:04:27.160 talking about any of this stuff was
01:04:28.880 straight up nonsense yes but now people
01:04:31.240 are like hold on that's probably what
01:04:34.119 disclosure actually looks like it looks
01:04:36.200 like a slow trickle integration into the
01:04:40.039 zit guys to the point where it's just
01:04:41.920 normal because a lot of times they're
01:04:43.839 right A lot of times it turns out that
01:04:46.160 they were right that no we couldn't have
01:04:48.200 told people this because yeah they would
01:04:50.559 have went and this would have happened
01:04:52.640 and that would have happened and you can
01:04:54.279 start to see that like yeah that's
01:04:58.319 why when when you you think about what
01:05:00.760 what people have always believed that's
01:05:02.520 why angels and Devils freak me
01:05:06.079 out because no one wants to
01:05:11.440 believe that there's a Satan that
01:05:14.279 there's a devil you believe an
01:05:16.079 astronauts though right yeah
01:05:20.279 okay but people have always said there
01:05:22.680 is you mean a bad and a good yeah not
01:05:25.240 just a bad and a good but an actual evil
01:05:27.160 malevolent Force no just start with bad
01:05:29.680 and good okay so if we start at bad and
01:05:32.400 good then we understand what must be at
01:05:34.799 the extremes of that right nobody's
01:05:37.599 telling a different story and then
01:05:40.000 there's a concept of actual entities yes
01:05:43.480 actual demonic entities that do exist
01:05:47.000 well I'm saying your DNA is either fused
01:05:49.680 or it's
01:05:51.279 not if it is it requires a fuse
01:05:56.000 user that's all a fuser right what do
01:06:00.039 you mean by
01:06:04.440 that I'm I'm
01:06:07.680 saying if they tell you that certain
01:06:10.079 parts of your DNA are
01:06:14.079 fused that requires a
01:06:17.279 fuser did I say that right I'm not sure
01:06:20.720 I see what you're
01:06:21.839 saying the the structure to us in
01:06:25.480 everything all of it does seem
01:06:31.079 remarkable in a no mistakes type of way
01:06:34.240 yeah in an synchronistic sort of a way
01:06:36.720 which flies in the face of The
01:06:40.079 Accidental Big Bang nothing from nothing
01:06:42.960 way of thinking and it always has been
01:06:47.640 well that's what I think like in the
01:06:49.680 beginning there was light when they talk
01:06:51.640 about that if you were going to describe
01:06:53.559 the beginning of the universe you even
01:06:55.480 if you're describing the Big Bang which
01:06:58.039 there's a lot of speculation that that
01:07:00.119 wasn't necessarily the beginning that
01:07:02.880 there might be a continuous cycle of
01:07:05.440 these events happening over and over
01:07:07.160 again but if you were talking about a
01:07:08.760 creation story you would say in the
01:07:10.880 beginning there was light there was was
01:07:13.599 [ __ ] enormous amount of light it
01:07:15.200 created the entire
01:07:16.960 universe literally literally right I
01:07:20.079 think which is all it says and and and
01:07:22.520 here's like whatever they say that hell
01:07:25.920 or Hades is in any of these religions
01:07:29.920 worldwide it is the perfect description
01:07:33.279 for what a black hole is in real
01:07:38.359 life it is you fall through forever a
01:07:42.480 bottomless pit
01:07:44.640 yeah where time doesn't exist where time
01:07:47.640 does not exist where you don't die but
01:07:50.279 you don't exit where the information and
01:07:54.480 like and it eats
01:07:56.359 Stars right but but how but it eats
01:08:01.880 stars and Galaxy all that right
01:08:06.279 but but we can have multiple of them and
01:08:10.319 everything will still be okay they're
01:08:12.440 the center the center of that's the flex
01:08:15.480 yeah yeah we're fine with them it's like
01:08:18.198 if you live in Africa you got to deal
01:08:19.359 with lions what's this thing oh it kills
01:08:20.799 everything right everything what
01:08:22.198 everything it touches everything
01:08:23.960 everything it's going to get us
01:08:24.880 eventually but not now what you mean you
01:08:27.238 have two of
01:08:29.359 them they find them floating around they
01:08:32.439 find them they find them floating around
01:08:34.479 right I mean they noticed them yeah they
01:08:36.319 noticed that they're out there floating
01:08:37.600 around yeah they found one that's so
01:08:40.120 [ __ ] big it's they we did this thing
01:08:43.158 we played a video of how small the Earth
01:08:45.040 is in comparison to the Sun how small
01:08:46.799 the sun is in comparison to Giant stars
01:08:49.439 and how small giant stars are into the
01:08:52.520 most the most massive super massive
01:08:55.080 black hole that they know currently it's
01:08:58.080 bananas what our perfect habitat is so
01:09:01.080 perfect that anyone universally with
01:09:05.520 sense would say whooo location location
01:09:09.238 location you know like the greatest real
01:09:12.000 estate agent ever if the moon or the sun
01:09:14.120 were further back we' we'd be [ __ ]
01:09:16.799 yeah or closer like like the whole thing
01:09:21.120 is you know someone later
01:09:26.000 saying do you think Beverly Hills was
01:09:29.880 uh you think this was an area they built
01:09:32.719 on
01:09:35.198 purpose
01:09:36.719 mhm yeah was oh don't let me oh just
01:09:42.640 imagine if the the moon was slightly
01:09:46.198 smaller just imagine look imagine if the
01:09:48.880 Earth was slightly further away from the
01:09:50.399 Sun they know that
01:09:56.440 it's to the point where it some of it
01:09:58.719 might have been artificially done and
01:10:00.800 they're aware of that they're they're
01:10:02.760 aware of um the
01:10:06.239 true so the AR specific of the solar
01:10:09.239 system oh the moon right I've heard that
01:10:11.600 theory that's a wild Theory well some of
01:10:14.480 it's not Theory like I I was I
01:10:20.600 was on that subject as a te teenager but
01:10:25.440 as a grown person is when the um thing
01:10:31.040 happened where they hit it with the
01:10:33.080 missile and it rang like a bell
01:10:36.320 like certain things are um what was the
01:10:40.120 explanation for that cuz it did have
01:10:42.800 some sort of a crazy like the question
01:10:44.679 is who will offer an explanation right
01:10:47.800 because it wasn't like that they they
01:10:50.360 didn't just do it once like all account
01:10:54.280 say it rang like a bell for hours and
01:10:58.040 hours and hours imagine if that's a
01:11:00.480 feature for stable plan that they put
01:11:03.560 there well that's how Xbox works really
01:11:07.199 you know um or Playstation I'm an Xbox
01:11:11.199 guy but I'm saying you know you have
01:11:13.760 your gaming system and it just requires
01:11:17.640 that in your WiFi nearby and Bam you
01:11:21.800 know make things happen
01:11:25.040 and so many of our things
01:11:29.360 globally we come by understanding that
01:11:32.640 the magnetics and Dynamics and things
01:11:36.199 that really
01:11:38.360 work there's a lot of people that think
01:11:41.159 that whatever we're seeing isn't just
01:11:44.159 from another planet but From Another
01:11:45.960 Dimension that they're dimensional
01:11:49.320 Travelers that they have access to
01:11:52.840 places that we don't have have access to
01:11:55.080 cuz we're too primitive we we can't wrap
01:11:56.880 our head around it as a civilization we
01:11:58.960 haven't reached the ability to transcend
01:12:03.480 but that they can and that they're here
01:12:04.920 all the
01:12:06.199 time
01:12:08.600 well the way we look at it you know
01:12:11.600 we're the greatest spot in the universe
01:12:14.600 but The Travelers don't lead us to
01:12:17.520 believe that well there's always
01:12:19.679 competition there's always going to be a
01:12:21.920 greater civilization than the one
01:12:23.880 previous there's always going to be more
01:12:25.639 there always going to be more if people
01:12:27.760 are going to innovate to the point where
01:12:28.920 they're going to make spacecrafts that
01:12:30.360 means these people are competing with
01:12:31.600 each other these things whatever they
01:12:33.560 are they're still they they must be in
01:12:35.400 some sort of competition there's must be
01:12:37.440 something that motivates them and so
01:12:40.080 right but at at that level competition
01:12:42.679 is healthy and there are no unhealthy
01:12:46.000 components so hopefully well no not
01:12:49.400 hopefully definitely once once we're all
01:12:53.639 um building Spa personal
01:12:56.560 space um Contraptions for ourselves
01:13:00.840 we're going to push one another it's
01:13:03.840 it's not just um we're going to all want
01:13:07.199 the best one yeah and um we're going to
01:13:10.400 insist that that be the case just like
01:13:12.480 we do with cars when I said hopefully
01:13:14.120 what I mean is that like hopefully they
01:13:16.800 will be like healthy friendly
01:13:19.159 competition that's what motivates them
01:13:21.560 what's not hopeful is that they could be
01:13:23.480 robotic emotionless things that have
01:13:26.199 transcended biological needs and that
01:13:29.480 they just have a function that function
01:13:33.239 is seeding intelligent life in the
01:13:35.840 universe and establishing PL just like
01:13:38.360 you would be a farmer and you would go
01:13:40.320 out and leave hay for the animals needs
01:13:43.000 are primitive yeah they are primitive
01:13:46.080 but it we're always moving into some
01:13:48.280 more and more complex Direction
01:13:51.199 technologically it seems like that's
01:13:52.840 never going to stop right and the only
01:13:55.400 thing that makes sense to me is that
01:13:56.880 we're we're doing something because
01:13:58.639 that's like what we're literally
01:14:00.040 designed to do it's we have all these
01:14:02.760 things that sort of motivate people and
01:14:05.320 greed and lust and curiosity but what
01:14:08.320 we're doing is we're always making
01:14:09.719 better things yeah constantly making
01:14:12.199 better things which would lead
01:14:13.320 ultimately to the creation of a higher
01:14:15.800 life form some some more intelligent
01:14:18.840 emotionless being and that's the scary
01:14:21.280 thought is that all this life out there
01:14:23.760 is life that was created by biological
01:14:26.560 creatures who had these desires and
01:14:28.960 needs that ultimately led to them making
01:14:31.440 a better version of them and then that
01:14:34.280 is like the butterfly that comes out of
01:14:37.159 the Cocoon as soon as we put people in
01:14:40.280 space we became aliens that day right
01:14:43.280 right
01:14:44.520 yeah a lot of things are perspective
01:14:47.760 that's true I mean you could say you're
01:14:49.320 a camper but you really only going in a
01:14:50.840 tent your yard you're still kind of
01:14:52.880 camping
01:14:53.800 well but that's what we're doing our guy
01:14:56.639 has put a date on the uh Mars
01:14:59.639 colonization though right yeah but he's
01:15:02.600 also put a date on the Roadster when
01:15:04.639 that Tesla roadster's coming out that
01:15:06.159 motherfucker's never going to see the
01:15:07.280 light of day when is that car coming out
01:15:09.560 no because something about it the other
01:15:11.400 day that car is supposed to be out for
01:15:13.040 years yeah it's supposed to be out two
01:15:14.239 or three years ago I think that's godamn
01:15:16.000 that's part of being a billionaire is
01:15:18.960 it's not worth putting out something
01:15:21.719 that's not right it doesn't matter how
01:15:24.040 bad it's wanted well he actually
01:15:26.120 explained that he said it was man
01:15:27.840 manufacturing is insanely difficult and
01:15:29.639 the way he explained it it's you know
01:15:31.600 you don't consider it because of you
01:15:33.000 know people just manufacture things you
01:15:34.440 think it's normal but he was like the
01:15:36.040 process of manufacturing especially like
01:15:38.320 a car and electric car insanely
01:15:41.679 difficult he had a harder time doing
01:15:44.600 that cyber truck than he
01:15:47.000 did yeah space stuff cyber Drug's hard
01:15:51.600 what's all folded Steel
01:15:54.040 it's this [ __ ] massive 7,000 plus
01:15:57.239 pound folded steel truck that goes 0 to
01:16:00.840 60 in 3 seconds and it looks like it's
01:16:03.360 from the future it looks like if you
01:16:04.480 were going to watch thing on Mars it's
01:16:06.400 crazy yeah that's that's what it is yeah
01:16:09.679 yeah it looks like the most futuristic
01:16:11.520 car ever
01:16:14.760 right yeah but as kids that's what we
01:16:18.440 drew I don't know when we're going to
01:16:20.199 Mars and I don't know who the [ __ ]
01:16:21.800 going to do that that's a 6mon journey
01:16:24.800 and you're just hoping so
01:16:28.280 what several billionaires were talked
01:16:30.960 into getting into a capsule with limited
01:16:36.199 air to go a long way
01:16:39.760 down that's a dark way to die just
01:16:43.520 knowing that you chose to do just know
01:16:45.600 even if you're a racist here in this all
01:16:48.400 death is dark so what I mean is the last
01:16:51.679 moments must be horrific no
01:16:55.080 more no more horrific than anyone else's
01:16:58.880 I know but there's something about the
01:17:00.600 choice of being you know thousands of
01:17:03.560 feet under the water no it's being a
01:17:05.800 billionaire
01:17:08.800 crushing your soul dies long
01:17:14.719 before I could have done
01:17:19.719 anything this is what I chose that's
01:17:22.400 hilarious yes that death that guy could
01:17:25.360 be fishing in Maui right
01:17:28.760 now with a nice cold beer hanging out
01:17:32.199 with his friends listening to some
01:17:35.350 [Laughter]
01:17:39.000 music instead he
01:17:41.120 hears
01:17:44.320 right he he's like carbon fiber starting
01:17:46.840 to
01:17:48.520 crack God damn it's already done at that
01:17:52.120 point none of that happening they knew
01:17:54.480 those people were dead a long time ago
01:17:56.880 which is interesting because I didn't
01:17:58.239 know how sophisticated the underwater
01:18:01.120 listening devices are but they have
01:18:03.800 these super sophisticated underwater
01:18:05.920 listening devices everywhere to make
01:18:07.920 sure that russan not sneaking up on us
01:18:10.679 cuz Russia will sneak up on a
01:18:12.239 [ __ ] Russia Russia snuck up on
01:18:14.320 people before s none of that is for
01:18:19.840 Russia you think it's for aliens none of
01:18:21.920 that is for Russia
01:18:23.760 um you you think that's for aliens um
01:18:26.760 that would be the wildest [ __ ] of all
01:18:28.080 time they underwater listing devices CU
01:18:29.960 they knew that aliens were under there
01:18:31.480 okay let's see if this is weed talk or
01:18:33.600 not let's go so which one do we know
01:18:36.199 more about do we know more about space
01:18:38.360 or do we know more about the oceans we
01:18:41.560 know more about space yeah quite a bit
01:18:44.520 more okay so yeah and part of that is
01:18:50.199 because the ocean's very difficult to
01:18:52.400 penetrate at some
01:18:54.159 point this
01:18:57.320 government um they're hiding things from
01:19:00.560 us I would hide things from people I
01:19:02.600 would definitely make it illegal for you
01:19:03.719 to have a submarine you could have a
01:19:05.560 yacht don't get crazy you can't go
01:19:07.719 underwater I got to know where the [ __ ]
01:19:09.120 you are if I need to collect
01:19:11.440 taxes well if you're floating around I
01:19:13.639 could pull up it was a conspiracy theory
01:19:17.040 at one point that you you know the
01:19:19.840 government got the bases inside the
01:19:22.080 mountains
01:19:25.600 right well until they had to expand the
01:19:28.080 boundary behind Area 51 and make Area 51
01:19:31.120 larger they never even admitted it
01:19:32.719 existed it wasn't until the Obama
01:19:34.440 Administration that they actually came
01:19:35.679 out and said Area 51 is a real thing we
01:19:38.120 need more
01:19:40.080 land do you ever see the video of Bob
01:19:42.320 Lazar the guy who used to work there
01:19:45.120 have you ever seen that guy that's a
01:19:47.800 wild I was following old Bob
01:19:50.760 Lazar yeah what do you think about that
01:19:53.360 that do you think he's telling the
01:19:55.880 truth here's the thing
01:19:58.520 Joe
01:20:01.239 just just an opinion but what I find
01:20:07.600 fascinating is the lack of imagination
01:20:10.920 in any of these stories where
01:20:14.560 imagination could
01:20:16.440 apply
01:20:20.080 like like if someone was bullshitting
01:20:22.280 you'd see evidence of it right cuzz
01:20:25.080 that's the thing if people [ __ ] they
01:20:27.199 kind of [ __ ] about everything right
01:20:29.400 cuz they think they're smart enough to
01:20:30.520 trick you no one's smart enough to come
01:20:33.199 up with one story only their whole life
01:20:35.920 their whole life they're straight down
01:20:37.719 the middle Square tell the truth all the
01:20:40.000 time but one time they decide to have a
01:20:43.280 Whopper of a lie and just fabricate this
01:20:45.840 thing and structure oh you're seeing
01:20:48.159 somebody tell you a
01:20:51.480 story that is the only explanation for
01:20:55.560 certain things that are happening yeah
01:20:59.760 especially he tells you a story and then
01:21:01.400 you have independent people who also
01:21:03.600 used to work for the government now
01:21:05.600 becoming whistleblowers and saying
01:21:07.880 there's a crashed retrieval program
01:21:11.040 crashed UFO retrieval program it goes
01:21:13.960 back to what I'm saying Joe these are
01:21:16.000 the this is how you say this without
01:21:17.880 getting cancelled look you do think
01:21:20.679 they're doing something don't you
01:21:22.960 they're doing something they wouldn't
01:21:24.880 tell us everything they're doing we want
01:21:26.520 to believe like nobody's doing nothing
01:21:29.440 like no no we're doing stuff like
01:21:32.600 they're doing something they're just not
01:21:34.880 telling us that that's part of it though
01:21:37.639 right you know what the people involved
01:21:39.320 in the retrieval call the vehicles they
01:21:42.040 call them
01:21:45.400 donations right well because um that's
01:21:49.560 what they think they are they think that
01:21:52.320 the limited times these crafts have
01:21:54.239 shown themselves you
01:21:56.239 didn't you as the driver or the occupant
01:22:01.239 didn't mean for that to be your
01:22:04.560 destination and um you don't take
01:22:08.880 anything um you only give therefore
01:22:13.239 that's why it's known as a
01:22:15.800 donation because it's like um it's what
01:22:19.440 you would say if one of those meteors
01:22:22.320 that we were talking about if one just
01:22:24.400 the size of a refrigerator landed in
01:22:27.400 your backyard
01:22:32.239 like a billion dollars can land in your
01:22:35.080 backyard easy peasy or obliterate an
01:22:39.560 entire city and send everybody back to
01:22:42.159 the Stone Age that's the wildest one
01:22:45.560 right but the but it's not that wild if
01:22:48.239 you look at the Moon right the Moon
01:22:51.199 shows you the evidence
01:22:53.080 that's a thing right like if we can just
01:22:55.600 look at it's just filled with holes
01:22:57.800 right big [ __ ] craters all over the
01:23:00.520 you can see with the naked eye well I'm
01:23:03.239 saying most of the people that are in
01:23:06.760 America and drive in urban settings know
01:23:10.679 what potholes are and so you know it's
01:23:13.920 the same thing
01:23:16.280 yeah this is a weird time where people
01:23:19.080 are just starting to pay attention to so
01:23:21.679 many of these sub objects and so many of
01:23:24.400 these like are we alone have there been
01:23:27.239 Advanced civilizations before how did we
01:23:30.679 become us it's been a conversation at
01:23:33.080 all points in in time like but more
01:23:36.280 people are having it now without fear of
01:23:38.520 being labeled an idiot well it's because
01:23:41.600 information is now um a free commodity
01:23:45.760 whereas in different points in history
01:23:49.719 it wasn't like that like right um
01:23:53.400 it was protected you didn't make enough
01:23:55.440 money to get access to this information
01:23:58.960 and no no matter where you're looking
01:24:00.679 information is the driving force of
01:24:03.239 almost
01:24:04.520 every war and conflict is um yeah it it
01:24:09.719 was about the place that you conquered
01:24:12.520 not only did you conquer them but you
01:24:14.679 got a chance to know what they knew and
01:24:17.960 that you found was more important than
01:24:20.880 anything else m and that's
01:24:24.000 um well think about the people that
01:24:25.960 lived just before they translated the
01:24:28.440 Bible from Latin how many people
01:24:31.239 couldn't read
01:24:32.280 it well that was part of the experience
01:24:35.400 that you were getting from church was
01:24:38.159 the fact that PE that it was being read
01:24:42.320 to you right you see what I'm saying it
01:24:45.400 not what we have currently where you
01:24:47.679 have the book and they have the book but
01:24:51.600 you know this person is literally um
01:24:56.920 reciting the word of God to you yeah
01:25:00.800 yeah and he becomes the holder of all
01:25:02.480 that information and the only one all
01:25:04.600 holders of all
01:25:06.480 information are that yep it's like a
01:25:09.600 human pattern that people follow even if
01:25:12.320 they just run an internet company even
01:25:14.280 if they run a social media company they
01:25:15.920 follow that same pattern well
01:25:19.239 because everything in the universe
01:25:21.520 everything on this Planet everything
01:25:23.080 that we could look at in the wildli or
01:25:25.119 in the plant life or E every Everything
01:25:28.920 is a Formula everything is that way and
01:25:33.119 that's one of the
01:25:36.119 um you know the science and
01:25:39.920 math go together with um the occult and
01:25:45.360 Alchemy and um all of these things are
01:25:49.440 based on things like like even the
01:25:53.119 Smurfs story right The Smurfs are based
01:25:56.520 on
01:25:57.320 something well um religious people say
01:26:01.159 oh you can't watch The Smurfs cuz it's
01:26:03.920 bad cuz they have Witchcraft and stuff
01:26:06.679 in there but the whole thing is it's
01:26:10.320 based on
01:26:11.960 this um the
01:26:14.480 homunculus
01:26:16.239 the idea that you can create a human
01:26:20.360 life form without a mother or a father
01:26:25.280 so really that's what the Smurfs are
01:26:27.760 based
01:26:31.360 on so who so who what what two Smurfs do
01:26:36.159 you think got together I know much about
01:26:37.840 Smurf and had Smurf at she was the only
01:26:41.159 female of the Smurfs so it's a good
01:26:44.520 question well it's not a question in the
01:26:47.000 Smurfs they tell you they tell you that
01:26:50.400 um Gargamel made
01:26:53.040 Smurf at but you know
01:26:56.520 in somebody's history I don't want to
01:26:59.040 say what race of people or group of
01:27:01.159 people it is but in somebody's history
01:27:04.480 you know there was um this
01:27:08.440 homunculus uh thing and like a
01:27:11.440 genetically engineered
01:27:13.560 human life form life form mhm creature
01:27:17.199 right whoa and so you know it's spoken
01:27:20.320 of his in his history um very
01:27:24.560 sparingly but um you know a lot of
01:27:28.480 things in in in the world are are about
01:27:31.800 perception you know so we don't believe
01:27:34.760 that there's clones we don't believe
01:27:37.679 that because we don't feel like we have
01:27:39.760 the technology but the truth is if you
01:27:41.880 go body part to body part you'll go uh
01:27:44.960 what if I lost two legs we give you two
01:27:47.040 legs well what about two arms I can give
01:27:48.760 you two arms okay well what about the
01:27:50.679 heart yeah no problem what about the
01:27:53.080 what about the like we're already yeah
01:27:56.360 all you'd have to do is make a clone
01:27:58.280 brain dead figure out how to engineer a
01:28:00.600 brain dead clone that'll grow organs for
01:28:02.639 you and then they'll make cloning legal
01:28:05.360 because then you'll never have to worry
01:28:06.840 hey Cat you need a new heart guess what
01:28:09.159 this sir this is the
01:28:11.600 same this is the same pathway that
01:28:14.639 everybody is on in all of these
01:28:17.760 departments like this is this is what
01:28:20.840 you like
01:28:24.040 people spend their life trying to find
01:28:28.600 the cure for a cancer you know what I
01:28:31.159 mean yeah and and working as hard as
01:28:34.880 they can every single day you know what
01:28:38.280 I mean
01:28:41.639 unsuccessfully we those are the type of
01:28:44.040 people that help make the world go
01:28:45.840 around you
01:28:51.000 know
01:28:53.719 mhm yeah cuz it's all about information
01:28:56.480 and we we be so close most of the
01:29:02.440 time MH but that's how you you can see
01:29:06.320 when we've had influence from something
01:29:10.600 else well I think it's very possible
01:29:12.840 that we have it's just so frustrating
01:29:14.639 when you want to know you know it's one
01:29:17.199 of those things
01:29:18.560 where life would change forever if you
01:29:21.360 had
01:29:22.440 undeniable contact with something if it
01:29:26.520 would just change Forever Your
01:29:27.679 perception of light you just to drive
01:29:29.520 through the In-N-Out drive-thru would be
01:29:31.520 different everything would be different
01:29:33.960 right but taking a [ __ ] would be
01:29:35.199 different there's aliens out there you
01:29:36.840 could say that about smelling Sals
01:29:39.480 or or mushrooms or you can say that
01:29:43.440 about lots of things yeah but about that
01:29:47.600 specifically that if that if we knew
01:29:49.760 that that was real cuz I think think
01:29:52.119 it's probably true but I still hold open
01:29:55.440 the P the the possibility that it's all
01:29:59.480 [ __ ] here's the whole
01:30:01.800 thing no one who has ever seen more
01:30:05.840 space or the universe than you and I has
01:30:08.719 ever seen anything that was
01:30:11.760 [ __ ] what do you mean in the
01:30:16.040 universe what I mean is like fake UFO
01:30:19.119 footage there's a lot of fake footage I
01:30:22.199 would want to see if you could see
01:30:23.480 something yourself and I have good
01:30:24.600 friends that have I have good friends
01:30:26.880 that have had experiences that they say
01:30:29.880 there is no [ __ ] way that that is us
01:30:33.440 that this is something
01:30:36.000 else right just understand that part of
01:30:39.840 the job in any of these
01:30:43.440 circumstances
01:30:44.960 is to kick up Kur fuffle like right
01:30:49.840 that's part of it like
01:30:52.600 if you live in Florida you see how many
01:30:55.880 times things go off into space and you
01:30:59.239 know that there's a pattern between that
01:31:02.520 and government airplanes and like
01:31:07.239 like our stories of cooperation have
01:31:10.719 been nothing but Cooperative as they
01:31:13.560 could only be like we don't hold any
01:31:19.199 leverage I think some of the [ __ ] that
01:31:21.199 we're seeing is our
01:31:23.239 stuff right I'm saying but nobody will
01:31:26.520 have a way
01:31:29.159 of like as advanced as we
01:31:33.880 are we still got to let that balloon fly
01:31:37.040 over right
01:31:38.690 [Laughter]
01:31:44.280 yeah what the [ __ ] is that that's the
01:31:46.440 most obvious [ __ ] ever that's your
01:31:47.920 neighbor peeking over the fence no it is
01:31:51.400 not it is your neighbor's drone yeah
01:31:54.960 your neighbor's drone in your over your
01:31:57.280 house yeah right ridiculous
01:32:01.320 right filled with a
01:32:04.520 pinata of the next
01:32:07.080 Co
01:32:08.719 right I mean what are they
01:32:11.080 doing Flying robots it's not like that
01:32:14.320 it's not like that in the world of
01:32:16.119 flying
01:32:17.639 things sometimes things go off course M
01:32:22.600 you see what I'm saying you think that's
01:32:24.800 all especially spy stuff do you think
01:32:27.159 that's all it was it went off course
01:32:28.480 that it just magically happened to go
01:32:29.960 near all the military bases don't say
01:32:31.639 magically I'm say
01:32:34.639 wind the wind got it well I'm
01:32:38.159 saying bro they just flew those things
01:32:40.360 over and they H that Biden didn't notice
01:32:42.320 they said they flew over during Trump's
01:32:43.600 administration too but they didn't tell
01:32:44.840 him cuz they didn't want him shoot him
01:32:46.760 down neither of those stories is true
01:32:48.880 that information was out there like two
01:32:51.280 days right another one yeah they said
01:32:53.639 this was a hobbyist though but they
01:32:56.639 said a hob yeah this doesn't count yeah
01:33:00.719 this doesn't count and the way that you
01:33:02.360 know immediately is this says over Utah
01:33:06.679 like that would
01:33:08.800 be where you know that's like White
01:33:12.480 Sands right no that's New Mexico isn't
01:33:14.440 it yeah um what's a there got to be
01:33:17.239 military base in Utah though right well
01:33:19.360 I'm saying in the actually the image I
01:33:21.199 showed in the mapwise first one the
01:33:23.560 Chinese surveillance balloon is what
01:33:25.600 this is oh that's what this one is this
01:33:27.159 is the one from February 2023 that's the
01:33:30.280 one they shot down look at that so it's
01:33:31.679 just a balloon with the solar power and
01:33:34.840 some kind of
01:33:36.960 camera how
01:33:39.159 weird not
01:33:41.440 weird not weird well not weird if you
01:33:44.800 just think about human patterns we got
01:33:46.600 to see what the enem is up to just fly
01:33:48.480 over take some pictures see what the
01:33:51.119 [ __ ] is going going on with these people
01:33:53.040 I'm saying we can say whatever we want
01:33:55.080 but we're civilized and maybe they're
01:33:57.080 not civilized so if you weren't
01:33:59.199 civilized then maybe part of your job is
01:34:02.719 Airborne
01:34:04.239 Weaponry yeah so you got to test it
01:34:07.880 out you got to see what it can do yeah
01:34:12.040 and yeah they're going to go off course
01:34:16.719 okay well that's not Airborne Weaponry
01:34:19.560 but we have a lot of it information is
01:34:22.280 that's true information is Weaponry
01:34:24.560 information is yeah just knowing what
01:34:27.760 the conversations are over this wide
01:34:31.760 SWA of um people is worth money cuz at
01:34:37.360 the end of all these
01:34:39.080 information um driven society places is
01:34:43.239 analytics and that's what this is um
01:34:48.880 yeah I probably said too much no it's
01:34:51.080 all right
01:34:52.360 we'll be
01:34:54.679 fine I just wonder where it's all headed
01:34:57.119 because if it seems like we're building
01:34:58.520 towards an event I think about it all
01:35:00.280 the time it seems like um it's not it's
01:35:03.320 time to get a bunker it seems like it
01:35:05.040 might be a good time to get a bunker or
01:35:07.280 at least some a supply of
01:35:10.320 water well here's the thing if you
01:35:13.320 follow what becomes accessible that's
01:35:16.719 how you can generally see where things
01:35:20.280 are going you you know mhm and
01:35:25.960 so that's the true
01:35:29.280 magicalness of Elon Musk you know is
01:35:32.679 take that guy out of the story and just
01:35:34.960 tell that story and
01:35:41.080 yeah yeah he's moving us into so many
01:35:43.520 different directions all at the same
01:35:44.760 time the electric car thing the Internet
01:35:46.960 satellite thing and now this neuralink
01:35:49.119 thing the neuralink thing is the
01:35:50.280 craziest part of these things are
01:35:52.960 connected in
01:35:55.560 these higher upper echelon
01:35:59.560 conversations I'm saying you see the
01:36:01.920 same
01:36:04.320 conversation um with Tesla or D Vinci or
01:36:11.000 like information is what is limited
01:36:16.480 and whole Industries can be built upon
01:36:20.880 your ability to know how certain things
01:36:23.840 are going to hit certain people and this
01:36:26.280 was before we called things promotion
01:36:29.440 and marketing you know what I mean
01:36:34.760 that's Hollywood is not
01:36:37.199 really there to entertain you like
01:36:40.600 that's great that that happens but um
01:36:44.760 propaganda is something that is
01:36:47.800 important to all
01:36:50.080 civilizations well propaganda in
01:36:52.400 Hollywood movies is built into the
01:36:54.440 ingredients
01:36:55.840 list it's like if you want flower you
01:36:59.679 need
01:37:00.679 wheat like you're GNA have to get the
01:37:03.080 wheat and if you want to be able to make
01:37:06.239 movies about certain subjects you have
01:37:08.119 to be willing to work with some people
01:37:10.840 that you know it' be nice if you made it
01:37:13.360 so that this is what we're trying to
01:37:16.239 accomplish and this is showing the the
01:37:18.800 negative side of this other society and
01:37:21.000 this
01:37:21.920 is the this is our hero this our hero
01:37:24.119 who's going to go do America's bidding
01:37:25.880 and go over there and you're like okay
01:37:28.199 and those movies are successful and so
01:37:30.360 they continue this
01:37:32.119 relationship and you become a bit of a
01:37:34.960 propaganda
01:37:37.480 arm for the government and in turn they
01:37:40.719 don't [ __ ] with
01:37:43.400 you right but that's
01:37:46.440 what that's what makes information so
01:37:50.119 powerful is you
01:37:52.159 know you don't care how
01:37:55.440 people feel about the
01:37:58.159 ritual it's about the following the
01:38:01.800 ritual work and
01:38:04.639 so you can fool yourself into thinking
01:38:08.639 there isn't one but the evidence will be
01:38:11.080 clear so like when I when I be like uh
01:38:14.239 oh these guys are wearing
01:38:16.239 dresses everybody's like oh he keeps
01:38:19.239 talking about people wearing dresses no
01:38:21.400 that is a weird thing it's not like that
01:38:23.400 look at it from a different way look at
01:38:25.280 it show me one person that ever wore a
01:38:29.080 dress in Hollywood
01:38:35.080 unsuccessfully that's how you understand
01:38:37.360 what a ritual is so 20 years ago I knew
01:38:41.719 that transgenders was going to be a
01:38:44.560 thing it wasn't because I was a prophet
01:38:48.360 it's just I had gotten so much
01:38:50.760 information
01:38:52.520 that I
01:38:53.800 understood things are secular so I
01:38:57.480 understood that the earliest I had seen
01:39:02.040 that word
01:39:04.040 transgender was um baam met the
01:39:09.119 transgender um and so I knew that the in
01:39:13.719 the ritual of Baff met the transgender
01:39:17.719 to show allegiance to him you had to
01:39:21.599 kiss his ass ring really and it said
01:39:25.960 both of those things so I knew that both
01:39:28.800 of those things will become popular in
01:39:32.159 the future and that um
01:39:36.239 somehow calling people the goat would be
01:39:39.719 normalized over the Sheep being always
01:39:43.679 the most popular
01:39:48.199 reference let's just God damn we got
01:39:50.480 some good week we cat Jesus Christ this
01:39:53.199 must be the weed I'm trying to figure
01:39:54.840 out how to jump in on
01:39:58.280 that right which is my only
01:40:04.080 goal I always wonder whether or not all
01:40:06.639 the stories in the Bible it's just we're
01:40:09.360 we are experiencing it like the the mark
01:40:11.320 of the beast thing that we were talking
01:40:12.480 about earlier if that is not if that is
01:40:15.560 not I think if if you had to tell a
01:40:17.520 story for so many years yeah before
01:40:20.280 anybody ever even figured out how to
01:40:21.639 write it down and you're telling a story
01:40:24.000 about a civilization that allowed people
01:40:26.040 to put brain implants in them and then
01:40:28.280 all of a sudden the brain implants were
01:40:29.719 hijacked by machines and people became
01:40:32.800 just meat zombies controlled by
01:40:36.800 corporations that would be the mark of
01:40:38.520 the beast that would be a demonic thing
01:40:41.320 if it if a demon tricked human beings
01:40:44.400 into wearing a hat that turned you into
01:40:46.920 a zombie that demon would be like a a
01:40:50.400 famous character in books and
01:40:52.760 folklore but that demon exists and it's
01:40:55.760 just technology it just shows itself
01:40:58.400 through this desire for the newest
01:41:00.560 latest G innovations that are going to
01:41:02.960 constantly fuel it becoming more and
01:41:05.199 more powerful into one day it tricks you
01:41:07.920 into letting it into its head like a
01:41:10.199 vampire like the vampire stories you you
01:41:12.920 had to let them in remember that was the
01:41:15.040 thing you had to invite them in and if
01:41:16.880 you invited them in you're [ __ ] but if
01:41:19.520 you didn't invite them in for some
01:41:21.119 reason they weren't allowed to kill
01:41:22.920 you it's almost like the story The you
01:41:27.199 have to be able to benefit from the
01:41:29.719 zombie like there's no benefit in in in
01:41:35.119 that taken out of context like if you're
01:41:38.840 making them zombies so that they can
01:41:40.760 mine for you then there's a story of
01:41:43.840 that over there like
01:41:47.119 like that's the whole thing is when you
01:41:49.760 look at these ancient
01:41:51.880 writings they're not they're they're not
01:41:55.639 saying like um yeah so he was from
01:41:58.440 another world and um we had to bring him
01:42:01.280 our kids and he would eat them in front
01:42:03.040 of us like they're not telling those
01:42:06.119 stories they're saying
01:42:09.719 like Agriculture and literature and
01:42:14.280 cosmology right Explain the origin of
01:42:16.679 Life yeah show show the double helix DNA
01:42:20.159 two AA yeah
01:42:22.480 nobody's yeah saying out anything
01:42:26.440 outside of mathematic
01:42:29.440 parameters well the wildest stuff is
01:42:31.560 when you look at some of those old
01:42:32.840 Sumerian Tablets and you see how they
01:42:35.400 had the solar system mapped out they had
01:42:37.920 the sun in the center looked just like a
01:42:40.080 sun with all the marks around it it had
01:42:42.800 Venus where it should be Jupiter where
01:42:45.119 it should be Uranus where it should be
01:42:47.880 they were all in the right
01:42:49.760 spots it's crazy like the Ethiopian
01:42:53.119 tribe have the same that's what I'm
01:42:55.920 saying like no it's not yeah but there's
01:43:00.639 very there is no
01:43:03.080 craziness right everything lines
01:43:07.480 up um the same grids look at that that
01:43:11.119 is just nuts
01:43:14.800 man yeah I mean I don't know what the
01:43:18.040 conventional explanation for that is cuz
01:43:20.040 that Zariah sitchin guy who said all
01:43:22.560 this stuff he was often criticized that
01:43:26.119 people said that he took things too far
01:43:27.920 that his his uh analysis went too far he
01:43:31.199 just went into speculation but godamn a
01:43:34.040 lot of the stuff that he was saying like
01:43:35.800 you could see the implication in the
01:43:39.080 actual tablets themselves they show
01:43:41.199 these gigantic beings with these little
01:43:43.639 tiny people like sitting on their laps
01:43:45.480 and the people have tails have you seen
01:43:48.119 those it's it looks like gentic
01:43:50.840 engineering maybe it's a tail maybe it's
01:43:53.080 piping what Jesus right it could be
01:43:56.119 piping you understand what I'm oh yeah
01:43:58.880 what I'm saying is nobody's telling
01:44:01.480 these
01:44:03.320 outlandish
01:44:05.080 right but they're all kind of all saying
01:44:07.639 the same thing there's some higher power
01:44:09.840 that comes and gives you structure tells
01:44:13.119 you what to do and how to
01:44:15.719 live and every society information
01:44:18.480 information that's what they give you
01:44:20.760 they give you information yeah every
01:44:23.639 story every
01:44:25.360 civilization every time yep yeah that's
01:44:29.080 it and that's what we're all thirsty
01:44:31.599 for you know and when people well we're
01:44:34.040 thirsty to moneti that's too but also
01:44:37.719 humans individually are thirsty for
01:44:40.040 information we always want
01:44:42.760 information we want gossip we want news
01:44:46.119 we want [ __ ] we want
01:44:48.480 science especially if you have an
01:44:50.159 appetite for you know things that make
01:44:51.960 you think there's so much information
01:44:53.840 that people are just constantly
01:44:54.960 consuming this [ __ ] information like
01:44:57.159 Tik Tok and nonsense that just passes
01:44:59.360 You by but there's still yeah but none
01:45:01.639 of that stuff is nonsense well it's not
01:45:04.360 all nonsense what it is is it's just
01:45:06.440 another offo to to get your attention
01:45:09.560 right yeah which is what all of this is
01:45:12.920 about mhm from the Roman
01:45:16.040 coliseums y to it doesn't matter yeah
01:45:20.560 Roman Arthur's Court time like that's
01:45:23.360 the first viral videos right like right
01:45:26.440 right they would tell viral
01:45:28.440 stories yeah this is this is all about
01:45:32.040 this experience of being a human being
01:45:35.520 in this amount of time and
01:45:39.159 the uh interaction between other people
01:45:42.800 who have done this thing you're doing
01:45:45.560 yeah and in the middle of you doing it
01:45:47.719 you realize you only have a certain
01:45:48.840 amount of time and you're like God damn
01:45:51.119 it I'm just starting to figure this game
01:45:52.840 out right so understand
01:45:57.000 that's I was probably like 5 years old
01:46:00.320 when I had that moment so I Lu out
01:46:03.159 because it happened to me so early
01:46:06.760 but it wasn't about the yeah I got that
01:46:10.520 part so I thought I thought at like that
01:46:13.679 age I was thinking okay so I don't know
01:46:19.280 how long I'm going to live because I'm
01:46:22.159 kind of conflicted about how long people
01:46:26.480 live hundreds a good number but there's
01:46:29.480 been people that 600 it seems I don't
01:46:32.719 know like seems like there's but I'm
01:46:36.880 just going to space it out seven years
01:46:38.960 at a time so every seven years I'm
01:46:43.760 that's going to be a life so I don't
01:46:45.719 waste anything so I couldn't wait till I
01:46:49.119 got seven because that was going to be
01:46:51.520 the start of my first life why'd you
01:46:53.599 bring it into sevens just
01:46:58.080 randomly I don't I don't know what
01:47:00.440 randomly means
01:47:03.119 um it's a seldom seen thing in the
01:47:07.960 universe
01:47:10.719 randomly so just seven seemed like a
01:47:13.199 good number was instinctual or was it to
01:47:16.400 to people around the globe seven yeah
01:47:19.800 that's great lucky number that's why I
01:47:22.599 asked yeah well I'm saying not for no
01:47:25.639 reason I'm saying if you like math you
01:47:28.760 know I'm saying it's a great number um
01:47:32.880 that's how you know that the
01:47:35.360 pyramids are about something because of
01:47:38.560 what they represent
01:47:41.679 mathematically that level of
01:47:44.480 mathematical
01:47:46.119 information is another step in
01:47:49.320 Civilization
01:47:51.280 yeah the idea that that was just by
01:47:52.960 accident like when they they there
01:47:54.840 trigonometry is not by accident also
01:47:58.520 that they figured out like the they
01:48:00.960 there's some measurement I don't want to
01:48:02.639 bore anybody with the details because
01:48:03.920 I'll butcher it too but it's the
01:48:05.520 measurements of the height and width and
01:48:07.280 the mass of the pyramid in comparison to
01:48:11.159 the the circumference of Earth it's like
01:48:15.159 they they knew so much about like where
01:48:18.080 constellations would be at certain times
01:48:20.000 of the year like in the summer
01:48:21.800 solstice it's just wild [ __ ] man that
01:48:24.599 they did that all in stone but not that
01:48:27.239 wild though because we know that if you
01:48:31.480 were traveling that buoys are out there
01:48:34.480 and they're out there for certain
01:48:36.119 reasons and we understand um satellite
01:48:40.719 positioning and no no it makes perfect
01:48:46.880 sense imagine that's the pyramids were
01:48:50.000 the that was their ultimate buoy that
01:48:52.320 was home base well I'm I'm saying it's
01:48:55.080 not different than what how we would
01:48:57.360 treat a planet that we had not been to
01:49:00.320 before no not at all not different at
01:49:02.639 all I mean we would we would locate
01:49:05.360 where's the best place to land where is
01:49:09.040 the most hospitable of this place and we
01:49:13.440 would put something there and let's
01:49:15.239 imagine that we landed somewhere and we
01:49:18.119 found this lush green V vibrant planet
01:49:21.880 and we found those Hobbit people and
01:49:23.960 those are the most advanced people those
01:49:26.719 homo florasis Flor enesis is that what
01:49:29.800 it is Flores Flor enesis so this
01:49:33.400 creature this three foot tall human
01:49:36.239 imagine if we found
01:49:37.880 them I guarantee you someone would want
01:49:40.880 to introduce them to tools introduce
01:49:43.360 them to how to make fire introduce them
01:49:45.880 to figure out language try to transfer
01:49:49.280 their language to our our language try
01:49:50.840 to teach them our stuff try to
01:49:52.400 genetically engineer them and turn them
01:49:54.159 into something different if we have the
01:49:56.239 tools that we have now like crisper and
01:49:58.360 we found some primitive apes and there
01:50:00.520 was like a a massive population of
01:50:02.280 Australia pithecus on a planet and we
01:50:04.400 said look they're they're on the way
01:50:06.520 right let's just give them a little
01:50:07.560 boost just give them a little boost
01:50:09.440 right and that's what the people but not
01:50:10.760 too much not too much and that's what
01:50:12.520 you see with all of the UFO stories is
01:50:17.280 is they keep popping up in these time s
01:50:20.520 when we as a civilization are getting
01:50:23.199 ready to F it up right in real time in
01:50:26.719 real time yeah you know that's like my
01:50:29.000 comedy club that's why I named um the
01:50:31.560 rooms I named the rooms fat man and
01:50:33.639 little boy oh cuz the UFO started coming
01:50:35.920 after the big bombs that's when they
01:50:38.560 really started like ramping up their
01:50:40.119 presence like if you look at all the the
01:50:42.239 the reports the flying sauce reports
01:50:43.880 they're all like 1947 1950 1952 if you
01:50:47.639 cross engineer our [ __ ] it's going to
01:50:49.560 show up on our radar at some point like
01:50:53.239 this information is especially when
01:50:56.480 we're using that information very
01:50:58.440 recklessly wild even in the Bible story
01:51:01.880 the Tower of right this this story is
01:51:05.840 that you know with everybody speaking
01:51:08.800 the same language it
01:51:12.440 intensified [ __ ] getting done yeah and
01:51:15.760 they could do stuff that was hazardous
01:51:20.840 if they I think they're very close to
01:51:23.440 being able to translate language
01:51:25.360 instantaneously in real time because
01:51:27.719 they can do it right now with Samsung
01:51:29.719 phones the new uh they have the new
01:51:31.639 Galaxy s24 animals are doing it
01:51:34.000 worldwide oh for sure they they have
01:51:36.520 some sort of a language they have some
01:51:38.440 sort of a communication they they
01:51:40.400 there's something going on with animals
01:51:41.960 that's nonverbal and with all of our and
01:51:45.360 with all of us you know Tom
01:51:48.040 Green you know Tom Green right yes Tom
01:51:50.880 Green was here and he had he has a mule
01:51:53.159 and he said that you have like a
01:51:54.760 connection with that animal where you
01:51:56.840 know you want to go left and you start
01:51:59.000 like looking left and that thing starts
01:52:00.599 going left he goes it's really crazy
01:52:03.079 it's spooky he goes you develop it it
01:52:05.360 takes time they have to earn your
01:52:07.119 respect but once you develop this like
01:52:09.760 loving relationship with this animal
01:52:11.480 you're tuned into it like an avatar
01:52:13.159 creature just like when they would lock
01:52:14.719 on to their dragons he's like dude it's
01:52:17.040 like that I have that with women and and
01:52:21.239 with ducks and geese
01:52:25.040 and uh Canadian geese and goats like I
01:52:29.280 have no that's but understand again
01:52:32.520 that's part of some religion's story is
01:52:36.520 that one of the gifts
01:52:38.800 was um the relationship between humans
01:52:43.239 and the animal world and um it's
01:52:47.480 something that all civilizations have
01:52:49.639 been been able to use and it stayed true
01:52:53.280 you know yeah it it's amazing the
01:52:56.520 relationship humans have with animals
01:52:58.480 yeah whether it's a horse no there's no
01:53:00.880 especially like all we abuse some of
01:53:04.800 them and it well just Horses Don't
01:53:06.800 interact with people the same way a dog
01:53:08.360 does that's all I'm saying it's like the
01:53:10.040 interaction you have with dogs is almost
01:53:11.880 like psychic like they the dogs are like
01:53:15.040 your little friends you know they know
01:53:16.920 when you're in a bad mood they they know
01:53:18.639 when you hurt your foot you know they
01:53:20.800 they when they're happy to see you every
01:53:22.679 [ __ ] time every [ __ ] time Bar None
01:53:26.440 I have that relationship with everybody
01:53:28.960 that's
01:53:30.800 um yeah all animals and like special
01:53:35.159 needs people it's the innocence and the
01:53:38.119 Purity that you get what it's not always
01:53:40.920 good it's but it's
01:53:44.040 so we can learn from them that no we
01:53:47.719 have learned yeah we should know it but
01:53:50.400 we're scared people are scared of other
01:53:53.079 people being shitty and we put up like
01:53:55.639 Shields and we're you know we're worry
01:53:57.920 about running it's been proven real
01:54:00.480 historically is
01:54:03.840 that you know yeah it has Kan and Abel
01:54:07.159 is a real story that like you know what
01:54:09.440 I mean like people are like people are
01:54:10.960 so violent these days and that's
01:54:13.840 true but people have been violent like
01:54:17.880 there was this point where
01:54:21.360 humankind learned that they could take a
01:54:23.920 life and it changed things you know well
01:54:28.599 especially take a life quickly with like
01:54:30.719 when they figured out swords and bows
01:54:32.920 and arrows and [ __ ] what do you think
01:54:36.040 the story of Sodom and gomorah is about
01:54:39.000 cuz I was just reading that
01:54:41.639 last
01:54:43.360 cleanliness yeah yeah that that's what
01:54:46.360 took them out that like plague
01:54:51.599 okay because 69 times I've gotten
01:54:54.840 cancelled in this one conversation no
01:54:57.079 the stories of Sodom and Gomorrah
01:54:58.960 there's two speculations one of them was
01:55:02.040 that uh God decided that they weren't
01:55:05.199 hospitable
01:55:06.520 enough and the other one was God had
01:55:09.639 decided that there was too much sin wait
01:55:12.119 a minute that's not speculation that's
01:55:13.760 in the book right that first one right
01:55:16.880 but the but the respectability part that
01:55:19.320 they were not um hospitable enough yeah
01:55:22.199 that was a that was a part of it that's
01:55:24.119 part of it too so he just so God just
01:55:27.400 decid this I'm going to [ __ ] up this
01:55:28.800 whole city no no no no no right what's
01:55:31.119 the real story though okay so turned it
01:55:33.159 into pillars of
01:55:35.440 salt two cities right and he said find
01:55:39.239 me 50 good men and I won't do this and
01:55:42.280 then he I think he said find me 10 good
01:55:44.199 men okay so they this story is generally
01:55:48.880 used to say that God it doesn't like
01:55:53.679 homosexuals oh this is the story that
01:55:57.159 highlights that okay so it's not it's
01:55:59.239 not just sin it's not just so because
01:56:02.360 sodomy is even technically like oral
01:56:06.719 sex the meaning of that word comes from
01:56:09.880 Sodom Sodom and gomorra right right so
01:56:12.239 that's why I said it's technically
01:56:13.840 includes a lot of things people think is
01:56:15.440 deviant sex yo I got to piss so bad can
01:56:18.199 we can we come back to this so gorah
01:56:20.079 come back to this I got take okay let's
01:56:21.920 take a Le
01:56:22.960 take Sodom and
01:56:26.560 gomorra yeah
01:56:31.280 so it tell it tells several stories
01:56:36.239 but
01:56:43.520 um there had to be an
01:56:46.560 explanation for what the St story said
01:56:50.400 happened to two cities of people right
01:56:53.320 right there had to be a reason to tell
01:56:55.440 that
01:56:56.480 story most likely to tell this story it
01:57:00.520 requires all of those people that really
01:57:03.360 have been killed during in those
01:57:07.199 circumstances and the historical
01:57:09.880 evidence shows us
01:57:12.840 that something like that
01:57:15.480 happened like those two cities really
01:57:18.960 did EX
01:57:21.079 exist do we know where Sodom and gomorra
01:57:24.599 was are you kidding I know a guy who
01:57:27.599 will pull that information up so fast
01:57:30.199 and put it on the screen young
01:57:32.719 Jamie like is there speculations to kick
01:57:36.000 is awake now this is you going to see
01:57:38.159 the best part of him when Carl wakes up
01:57:41.079 Carl's awake now he's a 3:30 Waker right
01:57:44.440 um as we all would be if we were in
01:57:46.119 charge of our schedules yeah probably
01:57:48.639 what what do they think that
01:57:51.199 it like is there real speculation as to
01:57:53.639 where it was mhm where where do they
01:57:55.840 think it was it's not speculation a lot
01:57:58.239 of these places just Chang names like
01:58:02.159 they used to be called this and then
01:58:04.079 they later were called else but Iraq
01:58:06.960 used to be Su right like these are
01:58:09.560 literal places that you can find on the
01:58:12.040 real map that was that
01:58:14.880 was a part of that biblical Rabbit Hole
01:58:18.079 I was telling you about is just seeing
01:58:21.520 the my only concern
01:58:24.599 is how do these
01:58:30.480 ancient Islamic
01:58:32.920 Juda how how do you say that those three
01:58:36.159 that exist the um that all religion is
01:58:39.960 built on judeo
01:58:43.679 Christian Islamic M that
01:58:47.199 whole belief system of how that is a
01:58:51.400 specul operates right so you see they
01:58:54.239 have question marks here
01:58:58.119 right only because they know that there
01:59:01.760 were cities there oh so they have
01:59:04.639 wreckage there or like like for
01:59:07.840 example everybody if everybody in Gaza
01:59:12.040 talks about going there it exists if
01:59:15.280 everybody in
01:59:17.360 Hebron has family members that live
01:59:20.360 there it exists if
01:59:23.199 everybody we we know that so they think
01:59:26.880 that was right near the Dead
01:59:29.000 Sea wow well they didn't think it any
01:59:32.920 differently than they
01:59:35.599 thought talal ham if I'm pronouncing
01:59:39.400 that correct like these were places like
01:59:42.480 yeah people throughout history if you
01:59:44.639 show anybody of water those are
01:59:48.239 always
01:59:50.119 hotpots um water is its
01:59:54.400 own commodity and currency at all points
01:59:59.040 and that was the Dead
02:00:00.719 Sea
02:00:02.679 um but that's everywhere was the Dead
02:00:05.960 Sea always the Dead
02:00:07.440 Sea I think so it because God damn
02:00:11.840 there's so much interesting stuff that
02:00:13.079 came from that part of the world that's
02:00:14.800 where they found the dead a lot of the
02:00:16.480 stuff that was supposed to be
02:00:18.159 unbelievable was all based on something
02:00:20.920 real like right how long was it the Dead
02:00:24.320 Sea um long before they knew what high
02:00:27.520 salt content was right or they might
02:00:30.639 have called it high cont salt content C
02:00:34.440 but what they were trying to say
02:00:39.400 is stuff's not stuff's not growing here
02:00:43.119 okay don't be looking don't come here as
02:00:45.119 a fishing
02:00:46.599 spot right but it's a good spot to
02:00:48.599 gather salt
02:00:49.760 which at that point in time was as
02:00:52.159 valuable as anything on Earth Salt
02:00:54.960 they'd go to war for salt salt allowed
02:00:57.480 people to preserve their food Salt was
02:01:00.040 insanely
02:01:01.320 valuable understand the whole portions
02:01:04.159 uh because at the end of the day for all
02:01:07.239 people it comes down to quality of life
02:01:11.400 so the jump that was made between people
02:01:16.639 eating
02:01:17.880 food that that you had to kill yourself
02:01:22.000 catching just so that you could put it
02:01:25.079 over something hot so that you could get
02:01:28.360 it where you could eat it and eating it
02:01:30.480 like you that experience to
02:01:35.360 um seasoning your food and you know
02:01:38.840 having it order from the best place
02:01:41.679 because they EA too much spaghetti so
02:01:43.480 you get
02:01:44.360 fat right that's part of the greatness
02:01:47.320 of human experience and has has been
02:01:49.719 that the part of being a
02:01:51.800 king um or being royalty through all
02:01:55.360 civilizations was being able to
02:01:58.079 experience the
02:01:59.920 best culinary things because if you
02:02:04.239 believe in God that's one of the
02:02:07.159 attributes that makes you believe in him
02:02:10.040 because
02:02:11.800 um
02:02:13.840 every vegetable let's say that you would
02:02:17.960 have when it gets to the point where it
02:02:21.159 was spoiled and it would be useless and
02:02:23.480 you'd have to throw it away it becomes
02:02:26.599 worth more
02:02:28.639 money because it's compost no so what do
02:02:32.719 you mean like if you have potatoes right
02:02:36.079 and so you have potatoes but now you got
02:02:38.400 too many
02:02:39.960 potatoes um you could get vodka from
02:02:44.520 that and if you have too much rice you
02:02:48.320 could get stcky from that and if you got
02:02:51.280 too much wheat and barley you can get
02:02:55.199 and if you every thing that you could
02:02:58.440 have too much of we got too many grapes
02:03:01.440 you could get wine with that the
02:03:04.480 whole that's why alcohol was called
02:03:07.199 spirits cuz it's
02:03:09.239 literally a gift from God just something
02:03:13.159 that's just for
02:03:15.639 your milk once it's going bad that's
02:03:19.880 where cheese comes in like whatever it
02:03:23.280 is you would be having as a
02:03:26.560 commodity
02:03:28.520 um grapes to raisins
02:03:31.119 wherever like this is why we believe
02:03:38.199 mathematically because of the certain
02:03:40.320 things that are just done for the
02:03:42.440 enjoyment of
02:03:45.360 um yeah so you think there's a reason
02:03:48.440 why all these things exist why like
02:03:50.840 rotting fruit can become alcohol alcohol
02:03:54.239 can put you in a different state of mind
02:03:56.199 all of it is connected together so that
02:03:58.239 you discover it and figure it out unless
02:04:00.400 you can figure out the benefit that a
02:04:02.960 mushroom gets for being hucog
02:04:06.280 enic or the Frog that's the special ones
02:04:10.239 do what special benefit did that frog
02:04:13.360 get from that right why is a frog making
02:04:16.840 DMT is he living a Better Life as a frog
02:04:21.119 does he live under the effects
02:04:23.719 residually of constantly carrying around
02:04:27.440 DMT
02:04:29.079 right right right well they secrete it
02:04:32.400 when they're scared right isn't that the
02:04:33.800 whole idea that you you take them and
02:04:35.360 you you rub them on a windshield it's
02:04:37.960 weaponized from the beginning yeah right
02:04:41.480 right they they're scared because they
02:04:42.719 think they're going to die so their
02:04:43.800 body's producing it well the just like
02:04:45.960 ours the inventor of perfume and colog
02:04:50.159 was whoever saw a skunk in action
02:04:54.520 first because you know
02:04:57.559 it that's when someone was able to see
02:05:01.679 how powerful smell is even from a
02:05:05.719 distance and that the aerosol like you
02:05:09.520 know what I mean like we we've learned
02:05:11.719 so much from that world that's how we
02:05:15.079 know like we were able to look at
02:05:17.880 animals and insects and understand that
02:05:21.000 we would be able
02:05:22.599 to um do the
02:05:26.079 helicopter after
02:05:28.520 we got past Orville and
02:05:31.400 Wilbur in Dayton
02:05:33.719 Ohio you know what I mean like we
02:05:35.719 understood cuz we had seen the
02:05:37.760 hummingbird you know what I mean like we
02:05:41.040 had seen how things work have you ever
02:05:43.840 seen those Egyptian
02:05:45.440 gliders they found these gliders these
02:05:49.559 wooden things that they carved that look
02:05:51.760 like [ __ ] planes and they were in
02:05:54.280 some of the tombs that they had
02:05:55.880 found thousands of years
02:05:58.480 old looks like a [ __ ] airplane I mean
02:06:01.719 straight up looks exactly like an air is
02:06:04.800 saying that these are
02:06:08.719 things talked about there like even even
02:06:12.920 if you're just following Jesus
02:06:17.599 right
02:06:19.360 okay so you believe that he was perfect
02:06:21.880 and that this was how he grew up and got
02:06:25.800 it when it comes to him going to get
02:06:28.960 information he went to this specific
02:06:32.400 place that we're talking about to get
02:06:34.679 information and to get taught and that's
02:06:37.800 not a hidden fact like it's been that
02:06:41.920 way
02:06:43.400 so
02:06:46.159 um you you can't be reading all of these
02:06:52.239 stories and not see how everything lines
02:06:56.760 up it does kind of line up in a strange
02:06:59.639 way you try to decipher it from all the
02:07:01.360 different cultures they all had their
02:07:02.800 different versions of it but at the end
02:07:05.119 of it there's a lot of similarities if
02:07:08.320 you follow the stories and like what
02:07:10.440 what they what are they saying right all
02:07:13.000 of them have some sort of a creation
02:07:14.599 myth well I'm but isn't that odd though
02:07:18.040 that a Creature if you think of human
02:07:20.040 beings as a creature that a a human
02:07:23.159 being that's never created a being
02:07:26.119 itself has this idea that a magical
02:07:30.239 force that is all knowing and all loving
02:07:34.360 created not not they evolved not they
02:07:38.239 came from this and they learned they got
02:07:40.040 better but that they were created and
02:07:42.440 that seems like a universal story The
02:07:45.480 created story that's only because the
02:07:49.320 duck that's outside of my house right
02:07:51.840 now believes that so so the duck is
02:07:55.719 sitting on six eggs on a nest right by
02:07:58.800 the house uh right by a 250 lb
02:08:03.280 dog a
02:08:05.520 alibi
02:08:07.840 um
02:08:10.079 and believes that it has life that is
02:08:13.520 sitting on and it's going to come from
02:08:16.199 that and that there's somebody there
02:08:19.159 that looks out for them
02:08:21.880 and make sure they're fed and the in the
02:08:25.480 Bible story it says um the sparrow said
02:08:29.920 like like Jesus said who who feeds The
02:08:32.920 Sparrows like like worldwide there's how
02:08:36.960 many birds like billions and billions
02:08:39.280 and billions of birds like who's feeding
02:08:41.239 them every day like real
02:08:43.500 [Laughter]
02:08:45.719 talk right yeah because because what
02:08:49.040 you're looking for is you need to find a
02:08:50.760 mistake that's how we would know maybe
02:08:53.000 there's no Creator but we don't go
02:08:55.320 through our regular life seeing things
02:08:57.400 and thinking nobody created it like I
02:09:00.040 would be as weird as us being in this
02:09:01.840 room going nobody made those curtains
02:09:03.920 nobody made these cameras nobody met
02:09:06.760 like what we we never have evidence of
02:09:10.199 that what do you think why do you think
02:09:11.559 people have a reluctance to take in the
02:09:13.960 idea of a Creator like what do you think
02:09:16.880 about it to them is there's some people
02:09:19.760 that fancy themselves as intellectuals
02:09:22.079 and they refuse to take in a concept for
02:09:24.360 which there's no proof and that's what
02:09:25.960 they'll say they use this very
02:09:28.360 reductionist view of what God is and
02:09:30.639 they'll say there's no
02:09:32.280 proof and that you know they're a stouch
02:09:34.920 ath atheists and a lot of them they even
02:09:36.679 talk like religious people that they
02:09:38.520 almost their atheism becomes a religion
02:09:40.760 instead of being completely open-minded
02:09:42.400 to the possibility you have zero idea
02:09:44.239 what happens when you die a lot of
02:09:46.719 people that are um um atheists don't
02:09:49.880 like God and God would have to exist for
02:09:52.960 them to not like so um the whole the
02:09:57.079 whole thing is if you
02:10:06.159 were to believe in the big bang you
02:10:08.880 would have to believe that that had
02:10:10.760 happened several
02:10:12.719 times throughout history just because
02:10:16.480 that's what we've seen from everything
02:10:19.239 been created we don't see one individual
02:10:22.320 unique thing that exists and is
02:10:24.320 responsible for all things except the
02:10:26.599 Big Bang those was a teren mcken always
02:10:28.880 said there's too much thought that went
02:10:31.040 into certain things like the fact that
02:10:36.320 um you can study all the butterflies and
02:10:39.960 not one of them has a sense of
02:10:44.440 humor you know what I mean but me and
02:10:46.719 you do and like goes for All Humans if
02:10:51.199 universally if we see somebody tripping
02:10:53.599 fall we all laugh no matter what our
02:10:56.199 back like there are certain
02:11:01.679 um yeah like like there's that I I'm
02:11:04.880 trying to think of what the reasons are
02:11:06.520 to not believe but I can't remember what
02:11:08.719 they are because it it doesn't it
02:11:11.440 doesn't line up with anything like
02:11:15.639 um and and we would have to have gone in
02:11:18.960 space and there would be no other
02:11:20.520 planets just this one just that's it for
02:11:23.880 this story
02:11:25.480 to makes sense universally like we we're
02:11:30.679 at a terrible time in history to say oh
02:11:33.000 we don't believe in people from outer
02:11:35.239 space when we can go to outer space like
02:11:38.119 it's it's almost asinine to try to make
02:11:41.400 both of those make sense and to think
02:11:44.000 that there's
02:11:46.159 um our son is not the the biggest sun
02:11:49.119 right not even close but it's the
02:11:50.639 biggest sun we ever going to see right
02:11:52.920 so it's the biggest [ __ ] sun right
02:11:55.440 but the truth is no it's way bigger
02:11:58.639 like right like that a thought went into
02:12:02.239 picking this particular Sun for this
02:12:06.079 planet and the moon and the positioning
02:12:09.559 of much as if you were building a house
02:12:12.920 like you would put particulars in like
02:12:16.040 Kid Rock like Kid Rock to make make sure
02:12:18.800 that throughout the time period of
02:12:22.040 History you put a stamp and a mark on it
02:12:24.639 right right that's why if you were
02:12:28.040 extraterrestrial let's say and you were
02:12:30.119 going to build one building on this
02:12:33.880 planet it would be the pyramid 100% like
02:12:37.119 most people don't even understand that
02:12:38.880 there was a whole outer covering on that
02:12:41.719 thing and gold cap at the
02:12:45.480 top it was a planetary
02:12:50.960 Monument
02:12:53.360 yeah you might be
02:12:55.599 right it makes more sense than the idea
02:12:58.079 that these people push those things into
02:12:59.559 place and then got them hundreds of
02:13:01.280 miles out of the mountain with ropes
02:13:02.800 shut the [ __ ] up throughout history we
02:13:04.960 have not done things that did not profit
02:13:07.800 us and I'm and not 150 years from now
02:13:13.079 right now right now all all through
02:13:16.320 history so to be thinking that this
02:13:19.280 particular civiliz oh you know what we
02:13:21.800 all care about when he going to die
02:13:24.679 let's we all I dedicate my life to when
02:13:28.760 he going to
02:13:30.079 die I'm GNA die while I yeah no history
02:13:34.280 doesn't say that in any way it's also
02:13:36.960 the sheer Mass
02:13:40.000 3,200,000 stones in the Great
02:13:43.320 Pyramid that is so much mass all of the
02:13:50.119 um Wonders of the
02:13:54.040 World are truly that yeah
02:14:00.199 yeah yeah there's a bunch of them too
02:14:03.400 man the wild [ __ ] that they're digging
02:14:05.679 out of turkey is nuts too that's the
02:14:07.679 gockley Tey place where they found
02:14:10.920 12,000 year old structures back at the
02:14:13.520 time when they thought people were just
02:14:14.639 using sticks and stones and hunter
02:14:17.239 gatherers no no because the whole time
02:14:21.079 they were saying that it was there yep
02:14:24.760 but understand these are the things
02:14:28.079 worthy of a war just so you know worthy
02:14:31.880 of a war yeah you see what I'm saying
02:14:34.599 all throughout history like you know
02:14:37.360 what I mean yeah that's the
02:14:40.199 only
02:14:42.079 um thing a rational person can take from
02:14:45.400 Hitler's story is being been able to
02:14:49.719 see um what if you had unlimited
02:14:53.520 resource and ability to
02:14:57.840 just follow Global rabbit
02:15:02.040 holes you find out that most stuff that
02:15:06.400 is labeled BS is not BS BS is very hard
02:15:10.280 to come by well the Hitler thing is real
02:15:12.960 weird cuz the Nazis are really into the
02:15:15.840 occult at some point in the information
02:15:23.599 process that was required
02:15:27.040 so it was required to be into the
02:15:32.520 occult
02:15:36.599 um so so in like the world of medicine
02:15:40.679 like certain
02:15:42.679 things before they had a label of being
02:15:45.599 toxic you just knew don't touch it like
02:15:48.559 you know what I mean you didn't know
02:15:49.679 what it was good for but um those
02:15:54.880 occultists were the keepers of things
02:15:58.280 that did work not things that did not
02:16:01.719 work right so
02:16:06.880 um
02:16:08.719 um but throughout
02:16:12.040 history that whole process of thinking
02:16:15.679 anything that could fall into the
02:16:18.360 Alchemy
02:16:20.239 conversation was seen as Ault based it
02:16:25.119 it meant um doing something
02:16:28.360 unnatural so even like the blacksmith
02:16:31.639 was considered a part of that
02:16:35.318 world through most of History really
02:16:38.799 because he had an unnatural relationship
02:16:41.439 with elements he was able to take this
02:16:44.519 and turn it
02:16:46.679 into
02:16:48.318 Forge
02:16:49.679 steel yeah oh that makes
02:16:53.080 sense yeah I always wondered like at the
02:16:56.638 heart of Al all processes that are
02:17:00.280 discussed at these pyramids and all
02:17:04.959 because they're all processes yeah I've
02:17:08.359 always wondered if Alchemy is trying to
02:17:10.519 regain lost knowledge like if one point
02:17:13.638 in time they did know how to just make
02:17:15.679 Medals they did know how to cre cre
02:17:17.959 elements they didn't know how to change
02:17:19.200 lead into gold or whatever the [ __ ] they
02:17:20.718 wanted to do that's what the this whole
02:17:23.478 line was consisted of but it
02:17:30.040 required money and time and all royalty
02:17:34.718 all Kings
02:17:37.398 all great leaders of the world this is
02:17:40.439 what you paid for was people that could
02:17:44.359 make things happen so uh um being able
02:17:50.240 to understand the weather and to then be
02:17:53.519 able to manipulate it in any way
02:17:56.920 possible was valuable all through human
02:18:01.519 history all the way before we get to the
02:18:04.318 seeding of clouds part do you think they
02:18:07.240 they had the ability to manipulate
02:18:08.718 weather back
02:18:13.679 then it' be wild if they did if that's
02:18:16.558 what caused the par desert to emerge
02:18:20.160 because all that [ __ ] used to be lush
02:18:22.080 tropical
02:18:23.558 rainforest imagine if that's humans
02:18:26.439 [ __ ] with cloud
02:18:28.638 seeding they just ruin
02:18:32.840 it well that wouldn't explain how that
02:18:37.040 has its own environment that's just as
02:18:40.359 valuable you know what I mean it f it it
02:18:43.638 goes to further um back up what I was
02:18:46.398 telling you about how it seems like
02:18:50.200 somebody put thought into every scenario
02:18:53.558 you might be in so let's say you lived
02:18:56.240 in one of them deserts and all you had
02:18:58.359 was Cactus guess what you could take
02:19:01.040 that Cactus and make tequila
02:19:03.519 too true like at every part of the
02:19:07.760 process like people figure something out
02:19:11.160 not the people figure something out
02:19:13.000 something is there to be figured out
02:19:16.240 right right
02:19:18.200 right well that's what the indigenous
02:19:19.920 people say about iasa they said that the
02:19:22.318 plants told them how to make
02:19:24.599 it the mushrooms told them how to make
02:19:28.160 it as a person that loves nature you
02:19:31.840 know that most of your experience in
02:19:35.718 nature is based upon how other things
02:19:39.599 react um you know what I mean so you
02:19:43.558 don't know that this is poisonous except
02:19:46.679 for the fact
02:19:48.359 that doesn't look like anything's eating
02:19:51.160 whatever is on here and uh looks like
02:19:54.040 everything is avoiding
02:19:56.800 it
02:19:58.640 like these are these are real things and
02:20:02.920 um that requires creation as well the
02:20:07.080 whole consequence thing and the fact
02:20:10.240 that this animal is able to live with
02:20:12.920 this thing that's going to be doing
02:20:15.520 damage to you so let me ask you this cuz
02:20:17.600 this is the end conclusion of that if if
02:20:20.479 creation is real and if God is real and
02:20:23.040 if God created us wait minute hold on
02:20:24.600 let's be specific creation of of what I
02:20:27.520 just told you about my ducks and her
02:20:29.240 eggs that creation is real for sure for
02:20:31.800 sure yeah I'm I'm not and life is going
02:20:34.200 to come from that yeah right what I mean
02:20:36.479 is that that God created everything and
02:20:39.640 that there's that there really is a a
02:20:42.200 reason for all of it what is the reason
02:20:45.479 for
02:20:46.319 us
02:20:49.560 like if God really did make all these
02:20:52.439 things synchronized together right and
02:20:55.640 put us here all
02:21:01.120 right first of all I'm grateful even if
02:21:04.479 you're not I'm very grateful like um I'm
02:21:07.000 very grateful what an experience amazing
02:21:09.560 time right and um if you take time and
02:21:13.280 space out of things right
02:21:16.240 like
02:21:18.479 the people that sold me Call of Duty
02:21:22.760 right gave me a great experience that
02:21:26.120 I've been enjoying for years and years
02:21:28.960 and years and the person that I am on
02:21:33.359 that
02:21:34.479 platform is the person I would like to
02:21:37.800 be
02:21:38.680 [Laughter]
02:21:43.680 all an experience has been delivered it
02:21:48.120 would be like
02:21:51.280 saying what was the thinking on somebody
02:21:54.640 making in an amusement
02:21:57.960 park
02:22:00.840 um to
02:22:02.800 amuse um people so that they could have
02:22:06.080 a full
02:22:07.520 experience
02:22:09.280 um and and be able to enjoy it you you
02:22:13.080 know that because things happen like the
02:22:16.479 humor thing that I was telling you about
02:22:19.000 and health how important good health is
02:22:23.040 over the opposite of that and um how
02:22:27.800 everything works without you needing to
02:22:32.000 micromanage it your heart doesn't
02:22:34.800 require you to count its beats and
02:22:39.000 your what's the percentage of
02:22:42.920 brains that are working perfectly versus
02:22:46.640 the ones that are not like all of the
02:22:50.200 processes needed to run you are just too
02:22:54.000 well done to be thrown away like not
02:22:58.439 important because if you learn about it
02:23:01.200 you'll learn about the whole workings of
02:23:04.439 the universe and it's like that in too
02:23:08.680 many different places for us to ignore
02:23:12.000 and the fact that we get a chance to
02:23:14.080 have that experience while at the same
02:23:16.840 time I'm looking at a dog right and
02:23:21.600 understanding that our life is one
02:23:24.319 billion
02:23:26.080 times greater than
02:23:28.600 phos and we can make sure Pho has a
02:23:31.840 glorious life and ours is still so
02:23:36.160 magnificent that we are in control of
02:23:38.359 certain things and that we can um not
02:23:43.120 get things right and then get it right
02:23:45.560 and not know things and then then know
02:23:47.720 things and then you know it's it's a
02:23:51.160 wonderful experience that was created it
02:23:54.880 is a wonderful experience and we seem to
02:23:58.399 have by far the most unique one on the
02:24:01.880 planet we seem very different than
02:24:04.080 everything else very different than
02:24:06.120 everything else even though we're a part
02:24:07.479 of it yeah purposely that's why I always
02:24:09.760 wonder super offici what are we here for
02:24:12.319 what is the what is the purpose is it
02:24:14.359 just to enjoy and be grateful which is
02:24:16.720 great
02:24:17.720 like one of the things that terrifies
02:24:19.399 people it's a very interesting concept
02:24:20.840 that terrifies people people are
02:24:22.520 terrified of living the same life over
02:24:24.399 and over and over again if you tell
02:24:27.240 people that the the Journey of your soul
02:24:30.560 yeah is that you will live your life
02:24:32.000 over and over again until you get it
02:24:33.640 right in one day you'll get it right one
02:24:37.439 in one lifetime you'll achieve
02:24:38.760 enlightenment but you're going to go
02:24:39.720 through the same lifetime over and over
02:24:41.720 and over again until you get it right
02:24:44.120 people are terrified of that but I say
02:24:46.520 right but would require a Creator though
02:24:49.080 you sure it would but what I'm saying is
02:24:51.359 why would you be terrified of that when
02:24:52.680 you're not terrified to exist right now
02:24:54.920 why why are you terrified of existing
02:24:56.520 right now
02:24:57.720 forever I don't find that terrifying if
02:25:00.960 you enjoy now if you enjoy now now is
02:25:04.720 great whenever you die is
02:25:10.399 forever you know what I mean so I so I
02:25:13.279 know and have known in my life that I'm
02:25:16.240 going to live forever I know I'll die
02:25:19.319 but I know I'm going to live forever
02:25:21.319 until then and then live beyond that
02:25:24.960 yeah
02:25:26.600 right well that certainly is a better
02:25:29.680 approach to life in that it gives you
02:25:31.720 comfort and that's what no that's what
02:25:34.240 history shows us history has shown us
02:25:37.319 that in what way that human
02:25:41.479 beings are um still here not because of
02:25:47.560 our wise decision making like nobody's
02:25:51.120 story says that um we've gotten ass
02:25:54.640 assistance along the way that we needed
02:25:57.840 it and we have implemented it globally
02:26:01.800 this is why those
02:26:04.840 um one world people exist because it's a
02:26:09.000 very
02:26:10.439 powerful concept to have and far too
02:26:15.120 lucrative and beneficial to
02:26:18.560 not be attempted yeah I mean if I was
02:26:22.560 going to run some Global power
02:26:24.880 organization I would try to co-opt every
02:26:27.359 single leader try to suck them in offer
02:26:30.120 support bring them out to wherever the
02:26:31.840 [ __ ] I have my big ass meetings fly
02:26:34.319 everybody in in private jets talk about
02:26:36.080 the climate crisis all organizations
02:26:38.680 have to follow the same rules yeah
02:26:41.800 that's
02:26:43.359 wild recruitment is an important fcor
02:26:46.960 said of all like we have to get some
02:26:49.040 young global leaders well understand
02:26:51.560 this is the only reason that um we can
02:26:54.800 talk about these big Illuminati like
02:26:58.319 entities at this period of time is just
02:27:01.319 because of time like they aged out like
02:27:05.920 you can't right get
02:27:08.200 in new
02:27:10.640 so everybody got decrepit over there and
02:27:13.960 they can't exchange really through this
02:27:17.120 period of history and so that's how we
02:27:19.760 ended up with the Bob lazars and
02:27:23.800 everything throughout history you could
02:27:26.319 really it was much easier to um get
02:27:31.240 people to not tell nobody right as part
02:27:34.240 of your job you know what I mean imagine
02:27:38.479 going to a world economic Forum
02:27:40.920 party what did those freaks do when all
02:27:44.120 the listening devices have been scanned
02:27:45.920 out of the room
02:27:47.240 all their phones been put into bags and
02:27:50.240 locked away in a lead Vault what do
02:27:52.840 those freaks do because you know it's
02:27:54.840 not normal [ __ ] you know everybody's
02:27:56.640 button down like that and wants to
02:27:57.920 control the world there's something
02:28:00.720 involved that's outlandish that they
02:28:03.000 keep a
02:28:05.080 secret that's always been the case with
02:28:07.520 secret societies I mean that's the whole
02:28:09.640 Eyes Wide Shut thing that there's some
02:28:12.399 freak [ __ ] going on behind the scenes to
02:28:14.720 anybody that really wants to control
02:28:16.080 everything you don't just want to
02:28:17.640 control everything you want to control
02:28:18.920 everything so you can get away with some
02:28:19.920 freak [ __ ]
02:28:22.080 too right I'm saying but these
02:28:25.880 Epstein like characters have existed
02:28:29.399 throughout history whether they were
02:28:31.600 Kings or what like like um human beings
02:28:35.920 are human beings universally so um
02:28:40.680 everybody is a supplier Epstein
02:28:43.760 Weinstein like these guys
02:28:47.160 um knew
02:28:51.800 what these extremists liked and provided
02:28:56.600 it and provided the way for you to like
02:29:00.399 like um to have a billion dollars and
02:29:04.399 not
02:29:08.279 create a Fantasy Island type
02:29:13.319 environment has not existed throughout
02:29:16.120 history
02:29:17.920 right right right and there's always
02:29:20.920 been those people can only kind of
02:29:23.640 interact with those kind of people when
02:29:26.000 you reach that certain level of wealth
02:29:29.600 and and Global success like you're a
02:29:33.479 Bill Gates Type guy how many guys can
02:29:35.240 Bill Gates hang out with Bill Gate Bill
02:29:37.120 Gates can't just go bowl and join the
02:29:39.080 bowling team and make friends with the
02:29:40.960 other Bowlers it's too weird he's got to
02:29:43.960 hang out with his his kind and the more
02:29:46.600 you do that the less you are in touch
02:29:49.880 with what makes sense to say and that's
02:29:52.359 when you see them saying the most
02:29:53.560 outlandish [ __ ] because they don't
02:29:54.880 recognize how regular people are going
02:29:57.120 to react to what the [ __ ] you're saying
02:29:59.359 you know what we're going to own nothing
02:30:00.880 and be happy what the [ __ ] did you just
02:30:03.439 say you just say I'm going to own
02:30:05.279 nothing and be happy so but there's
02:30:07.160 things so who owns the things and who
02:30:09.760 who enforces who owns the things and how
02:30:12.640 do you do that when you take take away
02:30:14.960 everybody's weapons you're the only one
02:30:16.279 has weapons and you get to decide who
02:30:18.479 owns the things and no one owns the
02:30:20.760 things and everyone's happy okay right
02:30:23.520 but part of what you're trying to do is
02:30:25.600 you're trying to come up with something
02:30:28.120 that allows you to have the power while
02:30:30.560 also profiting
02:30:32.439 simultaneously right right so if it's
02:30:34.680 modern religion let's say so in the
02:30:37.479 teaching of jesus' time right when they
02:30:41.080 said pay the tithes
02:30:43.720 right it was you had your whole farming
02:30:47.840 plot let's say it was 40 acres and you
02:30:50.200 had corn planted there right you would
02:30:53.760 just you when it came time to harvest
02:30:56.479 you would Harvest everything except the
02:30:59.000 rows that were on the fence right and
02:31:03.760 the rows that were on the fence that was
02:31:06.359 the 10% of your field that would go to
02:31:10.760 people that didn't have it so it wasn't
02:31:13.760 just you giv the 10% it was also the
02:31:17.279 fact that human nature is if you were
02:31:20.080 going to give people some of your crops
02:31:23.600 you going to pick out the best crops for
02:31:25.720 you and your family and then you'll put
02:31:28.720 another pile for the giveaway you what
02:31:31.560 I'm saying and this took care of that
02:31:34.040 where it was all equal and the person
02:31:37.560 that didn't have didn't have to feel
02:31:39.760 like they was a beggar they could come
02:31:42.200 and pick and see which corn they liked
02:31:44.600 and get you see what I'm saying well
02:31:46.920 that's a smart move just for Harmony in
02:31:48.439 the community too then they people have
02:31:50.319 a vested interest in this farmer being
02:31:51.960 successful with his crop right some of
02:31:53.960 that crop is yours but the decision to
02:31:56.560 take it from that to God said give me
02:32:01.680 10% in this plate is going to make a
02:32:06.680 billion dollars a day for a billion
02:32:13.439 people yeah this is why Tesla has to go
02:32:16.880 why because not what Tesla is saying
02:32:19.160 about electricity it's the fact that
02:32:21.439 he's saying this should be free for
02:32:24.359 everybody everywhere yeah he wanted to
02:32:27.800 have aerial electricity free for
02:32:30.240 everybody like radio waves and the day
02:32:32.279 that you say that that's a wrap it's
02:32:34.800 cheaper to keeper because we make 200
02:32:38.520 billion a day and we all agree
02:32:41.279 universally you should pay for this and
02:32:43.640 we'll be in charge of selling it to you
02:32:46.319 and we'll shut it off if you [ __ ] around
02:32:49.279 so for for us to say I think they're
02:32:52.160 going to do that with cars duh this is
02:32:55.040 how this goes in these 100% processes
02:32:58.439 yeah that's the conspiracy theorist's
02:33:00.040 biggest fear about electric cars but
02:33:01.760 it's not just electric cars we found out
02:33:03.359 it's an OnStar it's on you know I have a
02:33:05.680 Cadillac Escalade that that has an
02:33:07.920 OnStar the if I'm driving the government
02:33:09.840 wants to stop me they could just shut my
02:33:11.319 car
02:33:13.200 off it's crazy and if you were in that
02:33:16.720 business what would you tell them they
02:33:18.279 need to do it in the next five years
02:33:21.040 yeah make all like that get better at it
02:33:22.520 yeah get better at that um could control
02:33:24.680 where they go control the steering wheel
02:33:26.439 control everything I want you to Auto
02:33:28.439 driving on all cars auto driving on all
02:33:30.359 cars with third party input is this is
02:33:32.680 this not what we would say to Tesla I
02:33:35.399 mean to uh Elon if he said I want to
02:33:38.120 make cars right when we say okay well
02:33:40.760 these are the regulations and you have
02:33:42.439 to make them like this and you be nice
02:33:44.600 if you could just control that car here
02:33:45.960 this this is how you sell it to people
02:33:47.120 if someone steals your car we can get it
02:33:49.560 back and you go oh that's great someone
02:33:52.439 steals my car they can get it back how
02:33:54.080 are they going to get it back well they
02:33:55.399 control your car you can make you can
02:33:57.399 make it you can make it cheap enough to
02:34:00.840 not be a difficult sale though Joe yeah
02:34:03.040 make it cheap that's what capitalism is
02:34:05.640 about yeah well that's also like when
02:34:08.120 you get free internet or free uh
02:34:11.120 Services through Google right it's free
02:34:14.439 but what you're giving up is your data
02:34:16.479 which is extremely
02:34:19.040 valuable so they're giving you something
02:34:22.000 you you can now use Google but now they
02:34:23.920 have all your data and they're just a
02:34:26.200 big net that mines data and because of
02:34:29.200 that they become one of the most
02:34:30.760 powerful entities that's ever existed on
02:34:33.680 Earth you know there was a story that we
02:34:36.000 learned this from fisherman how a net
02:34:38.240 works and how much it's important to get
02:34:41.319 as much in as you possibly can and that
02:34:44.640 that's where analytics live and that's
02:34:48.040 where I'm saying this is where the DNA
02:34:51.000 industry is built off of is is the fact
02:34:54.479 of the future like it it at that same
02:34:57.479 point that you're saying that we'll have
02:34:58.880 those cars that do
02:35:01.040 that they'll be able to pred predict
02:35:04.080 crime oh yeah and step in before certain
02:35:08.319 things even need to happen or they'll
02:35:10.840 probably instigate you to a certain
02:35:12.800 level of stress that they could indicate
02:35:15.000 that you're about to commit crime and
02:35:17.040 then they come in and get
02:35:18.359 you they they won't need to they won't
02:35:21.200 need to be that uh nefarious only
02:35:24.960 because
02:35:27.399 um s some of this some of this stuff we
02:35:30.960 know already it just requires profiling
02:35:34.720 that we're not comfortable with
02:35:39.040 like worldwide most terrible crimes are
02:35:42.920 committed by
02:35:44.960 um
02:35:47.359 oh this is 73rd time I'm going get most
02:35:51.200 crime worldwide is is done by
02:35:54.359 um men with a micro penis and
02:36:01.080 um doctors know who they are and so at
02:36:04.600 some point they will be able to just
02:36:08.680 focus where they need to focus and they
02:36:10.840 would know certain things and that's
02:36:13.160 where you know this is why AI
02:36:17.160 exist you know if if you're you're
02:36:21.279 you're a your personal AI you store your
02:36:25.520 information you make moves based upon
02:36:28.479 what you've learned so it's not a
02:36:31.640 difficult process all through history
02:36:34.760 they had these oracles and
02:36:37.520 these heads and that gave answers and
02:36:42.720 this is where that whole occult conver
02:36:45.880 conversation intersects is because at
02:36:48.640 the end of the day information is
02:36:50.640 information and the universe is built on
02:36:54.040 a yingyang thing that is replies to
02:36:58.760 everybody and we're slowly getting
02:37:00.920 connected to that Oracle slowly getting
02:37:03.479 sucked into that black hole to the point
02:37:05.960 where it will be
02:37:08.240 inescapable right yeah and those old
02:37:11.000 billionaire dudes would love to be in
02:37:13.279 control of all that look
02:37:16.560 what else are you to do with that type
02:37:19.720 of money Joseph buy a bigger yacht yeah
02:37:22.880 that's the problem right this like
02:37:24.760 what's the next game you know what's the
02:37:26.960 real game as human beings that's what
02:37:30.439 our expectations are yeah
02:37:35.200 of always yeah what can you do and at
02:37:38.720 the end of the day no matter how much
02:37:40.600 money you amass it's only about
02:37:44.520 either how how you can help
02:37:47.640 others and if you do that you're never
02:37:50.600 going to be fulfilled either cuz you're
02:37:52.800 never going to help enough people and
02:37:55.359 that's going to be your whole thing is
02:37:57.160 not being able to help enough people and
02:37:59.880 just wishing that you could help more
02:38:02.399 right or feeling like everybody is a
02:38:06.040 commodity and that's the way this things
02:38:08.560 work and find out who I'm going to take
02:38:11.640 advantage of and do so and that's a
02:38:15.439 major part of a lot of things like
02:38:19.160 another major pattern that human beings
02:38:21.200 fall into time and time again well you
02:38:24.279 know the Jewish people are powerful
02:38:27.680 people on this planet and a lot of that
02:38:30.359 has to do
02:38:32.040 with the process that they have in
02:38:35.560 instilling in their young people a
02:38:38.920 certain amount of information and
02:38:43.080 wherewith all and conversation that does
02:38:46.120 not happen with other cultures let's say
02:38:50.840 and
02:38:53.240 um that exists only in a few
02:38:57.319 places around the world
02:39:00.319 but they're always
02:39:02.760 important um especially if you look at
02:39:05.560 things from a non-religious point of
02:39:09.520 view again it goes back to information
02:39:12.880 at all points I mean all cultures EX
02:39:15.840 exchanging informations with each other
02:39:17.399 in the healthiest
02:39:19.319 cultures are the ones that can both give
02:39:22.279 the most freedom and allow people to
02:39:24.840 innovate right helping ourselves and
02:39:27.200 others uhhuh and the profit and the
02:39:31.000 benefit and the yeah yeah yeah that's
02:39:35.680 part of the
02:39:37.520 process right but that's no different
02:39:40.960 than what everybody's religious story
02:39:43.279 says like what do you think think ghosts
02:39:49.479 are you think that's real I
02:39:56.200 um interestingly I don't I don't believe
02:40:01.040 in
02:40:03.279 um
02:40:06.680 well
02:40:08.330 [Laughter]
02:40:14.560 okay
02:40:16.200 you either believe in the natural and
02:40:18.240 the supernatural or you
02:40:20.600 don't and there are facets to everything
02:40:24.200 so if you don't believe in anything
02:40:27.520 Supernatural then I would assume that
02:40:29.600 means you don't believe in God
02:40:31.960 either um it's like I was telling you
02:40:35.240 earlier like I don't I don't I don't
02:40:38.319 know how you could be a Christian and
02:40:40.479 not believe in extraterrestrials it's in
02:40:44.600 your book
02:40:46.520 it says there was a war in heaven and
02:40:48.760 God was fighting Satan and threw him
02:40:51.359 down here
02:40:52.560 that's this is taking place
02:40:57.120 so also when you get to the Old
02:40:59.160 Testament Ezekiel story ezekiel's story
02:41:02.560 is essentially about a UFO
02:41:06.439 encounter I was really I was really
02:41:09.800 frustrated as a black
02:41:12.359 person that we weren't included more in
02:41:16.200 the Bible
02:41:18.240 right and so I was
02:41:22.960 very I felt very good when I found that
02:41:26.840 um some of the books of the Bible that
02:41:29.120 were
02:41:30.840 banned
02:41:32.439 um were banned because they had black
02:41:35.240 guys in them really what books of the
02:41:38.399 Bible this is the New
02:41:41.760 Testament is this when they were you've
02:41:44.680 heard the book you've heard about the
02:41:46.479 Book of Enoch right yes
02:41:54.399 right so if you know that book it says
02:41:58.600 that Noah was an
02:42:04.160 albino I always wondered about like
02:42:06.560 Noah's age they talked about him being
02:42:08.840 hundreds of years old tell everybody's
02:42:11.560 story and but here's my thought if human
02:42:14.439 beings become more were at one point in
02:42:17.319 time more technologically advanced than
02:42:19.120 we are now which is
02:42:20.640 possible we are on the verge of taking
02:42:24.479 human life and expanding it Way Beyond
02:42:26.680 100 years we're like real close to that
02:42:28.920 the people that are alive today will
02:42:30.040 live to be 150 I'm not qualified to be
02:42:32.760 having any of this conversation I'm
02:42:35.000 barely qualified because I've talked to
02:42:36.439 a lot of qualified people disclaimer but
02:42:38.640 but
02:42:39.840 understand we know more now like yeah
02:42:43.279 like we know that the Earth is not
02:42:45.560 spinning now the same way that it once
02:42:48.479 was we know
02:42:50.439 that we it's slightly different
02:42:53.000 measurably different
02:42:56.680 right I'm saying
02:43:00.399 um the interesting thing is in all of
02:43:03.520 those stories that we're talking about
02:43:09.399 um it never says that they did anything
02:43:12.720 different that got them to be in that
02:43:16.200 that position it just says that they
02:43:20.720 were blessed by God so yeah they were
02:43:24.040 there this is at a time when people
02:43:27.880 were dying of some things that today we
02:43:31.000 were called pretty easy you know but it
02:43:33.560 was wiping out
02:43:35.479 whole groups of people but
02:43:40.479 um yeah it's
02:43:43.840 interesting what's found fascinating
02:43:45.880 because there's no way to go back there
02:43:49.200 and see what the [ __ ] was going on so no
02:43:51.319 matter what you're not yet well let's be
02:43:53.600 fair though they're not telling some
02:43:57.319 wild story like if they say that a guy
02:44:01.680 had uh that that's this guy lived
02:44:07.680 um 600 years they're also telling you
02:44:12.399 about the
02:44:14.200 346 children that he had and his 1500
02:44:18.920 wives like he like right like hold on
02:44:24.000 are numbers to back up
02:44:27.040 right if human beings do live to be 500
02:44:30.080 years old that's a real possibility
02:44:32.200 that's that would be the only way that
02:44:34.279 you could show that yeah is by talking
02:44:38.439 about all the wives and all the children
02:44:40.000 all the and if you do take what we know
02:44:44.160 now in terms of like what they are
02:44:46.640 capable of doing now with with human
02:44:48.960 beings and lengthening telr there's a
02:44:50.960 lot of different methodologies that
02:44:53.800 they're using that they believe will
02:44:55.600 extend human life use of Metformin nmn
02:44:59.319 hyperbaric chambers there's a bunch of
02:45:00.720 different things they're doing and then
02:45:02.040 there's crisper when they're doing
02:45:03.720 genetic engineering on kids now and in
02:45:06.319 China they they did genetic engineering
02:45:08.640 that would make the children more likely
02:45:10.720 to be brilliant more likely to be super
02:45:13.399 intelligent Sor s
02:45:16.040 why are you acting surprised by key
02:45:19.120 components of the breeding
02:45:22.319 process
02:45:23.920 right true right if we're talking if
02:45:27.680 we're talking about the if we're talking
02:45:30.279 about fian or uh uh if we're talking
02:45:33.880 about uh German Shepherds or Dober M
02:45:36.200 piters this is perfectly fine right for
02:45:38.920 me to say that uh thanks to these
02:45:42.760 reasons this dog is the sheer example of
02:45:46.319 the confirmation of the breed and that
02:45:50.399 um his attributes are his intelligence
02:45:54.080 and his loyalty and
02:45:56.640 his right right this is all part of you
02:45:59.840 could do that [ __ ] in a test tube for
02:46:01.520 your kid why wouldn't you do
02:46:03.399 it that's what they're I think they're
02:46:05.880 going to start off with normal
02:46:07.680 stuff it all starts off as normal stuff
02:46:10.880 the because it's abnormal so the first
02:46:13.880 thing you're doing is oh okay so we're
02:46:16.279 in charge
02:46:17.680 of like how could you not how could you
02:46:20.520 not is more is more the question to be
02:46:24.840 had and that's why in that profession
02:46:28.120 they're allowed to do certain things and
02:46:30.560 then tell you they not going to do it no
02:46:32.399 more yes that's a key component to it
02:46:35.560 yeah we're not going to do that anymore
02:46:36.880 cat we changed our
02:46:41.319 mind yeah if they're telling you that
02:46:44.000 there's no clones guy telling you is
02:46:45.720 probably a [ __ ] clone at this point I
02:46:48.520 have no doubt that they've made human
02:46:50.120 clones they've made human they mean
02:46:52.319 they've made dog clones you can get your
02:46:53.800 dog cloned if your dog's going to die
02:46:55.840 you can get the DNA from your dog get a
02:46:57.760 [ __ ] puppy and it'll be eerily
02:47:00.080 similar to your dog they think including
02:47:02.399 some personality traits which is just
02:47:04.800 very bizarre very pet cemetery right but
02:47:07.520 if they could do that why can't they do
02:47:09.760 that to people they can well here's the
02:47:11.600 thing here's the thing before this go go
02:47:15.240 off the rail it's too late
02:47:20.040 um because there is a God the bar has
02:47:24.680 been set so insanely high for your
02:47:29.040 clone that you can't really get much
02:47:31.800 usage out of it so well if there is a
02:47:35.279 God and you have a clone the Clone
02:47:36.680 doesn't have a soul because you don't
02:47:37.840 have a soul to give that clone that's or
02:47:39.800 a personality or or certain things like
02:47:42.520 a subconscious like that's not a
02:47:44.880 available on the market lungs are heart
02:47:48.439 is arms are right but subconscious you
02:47:52.960 still don't we still don't have the
02:47:55.040 understanding of that or how how we're
02:47:58.240 able to be as brilliant as we are in
02:48:01.640 this world while only using a portion of
02:48:05.040 the we
02:48:07.160 we though there are those of us that
02:48:09.800 know with the pineal
02:48:13.279 gland what
02:48:16.439 what medicine says it's for and um what
02:48:21.399 that would mean and so those people's
02:48:25.120 job is to make sure that there's
02:48:26.720 fluoride in all the
02:48:28.640 water so your pineal gland will shrivel
02:48:33.040 get calcified or whatever happens to it
02:48:35.080 that's all the fluoride thing is wild
02:48:38.080 the fact that people aren't up in arms
02:48:40.720 about them putting fluoride in your
02:48:43.359 [ __ ] drinking water is so so crazy
02:48:45.560 it's so unnecessary it's brilliant on
02:48:47.800 the other end though so what what
02:48:49.920 happened is the reason people have that
02:48:53.200 um relationship is they cleaned up the
02:48:57.560 water the same time that they did that
02:49:00.600 you understand what I'm saying so people
02:49:02.800 at that time just remembered the water
02:49:05.000 not being that great and then all of a
02:49:07.520 sudden the water is really great and
02:49:09.479 it's got fluoride and it's good for your
02:49:11.760 good for your teeth right despite the
02:49:14.479 fact that there's direct correlations
02:49:17.160 between high levels of fluoride in
02:49:19.880 drinking water and low IQs they think it
02:49:22.800 lowers people's IQs they think it's
02:49:25.640 terrible for you fluoride's dangerous
02:49:27.520 you're not supposed to swallow
02:49:28.479 toothpaste look whatever you're
02:49:31.439 saying people won't find out about that
02:49:34.560 for a hundred years and I'm not even
02:49:36.840 going to be a
02:49:38.760 100 and most of these decisions are made
02:49:41.800 like that yeah well that most people are
02:49:44.760 terribly unaware of the fluoride thing
02:49:47.600 when you bring up they always say it's
02:49:49.160 good for your teeth like isn't don't you
02:49:51.399 brush your [ __ ] teeth like why do you
02:49:53.279 need fluoride why do you need fluoride
02:49:54.920 in your water are you sure that's what
02:49:57.000 why your teeth aren't falling out it's
02:49:58.560 the fact that people don't understand
02:50:00.920 that it's a toxic thing that you can't
02:50:04.120 buy or purchase or handle it's in your
02:50:07.399 Dr drinking water like and it's not
02:50:10.000 doing you any good other than supposedly
02:50:11.920 it's good for your teeth well even if it
02:50:14.760 it was yeah even if it was what cost
02:50:17.840 even if it was great for your teeth and
02:50:19.760 your bones you drinking it wouldn't be
02:50:22.920 the way you'd be trying to get that no
02:50:25.439 but but
02:50:27.000 um I don't even use fluide
02:50:29.920 toothpaste I'm not going to let you take
02:50:32.640 me where this conversation is going now
02:50:36.479 that we went to fluoride like I'm have
02:50:39.000 to cut no further than that because once
02:50:42.560 you start having the what they do like
02:50:46.200 yeah yeah you understand everything's a
02:50:48.239 campaign and that's how you can approach
02:50:51.200 everything is find
02:50:53.040 out where who's making money off this
02:50:55.239 where's the profit how does this make
02:50:57.359 sense why yeah somewhere right now the
02:50:59.880 fluoride plants are going what the [ __ ]
02:51:01.840 are they talking about did somebody just
02:51:04.279 introduced legislation to try to remove
02:51:06.080 fluoride from some state from drinking
02:51:09.000 water people some people are waking up
02:51:11.399 to it they're realizing like this is so
02:51:13.399 unnecessary and obviously not good well
02:51:16.439 just understand that um there are far
02:51:19.920 too many places that don't have clean
02:51:22.359 Waters MH so you know
02:51:27.279 like Flint Michigan
02:51:31.200 Still Still Still that water's [ __ ] up
02:51:35.479 there's what about that place in Ohio
02:51:37.560 where hold on hold on
02:51:43.239 and why because it's nobody wants it to
02:51:47.520 be their fault so nobody will take like
02:51:51.479 right you understand
02:51:53.560 how well even the
02:51:55.920 government not there's plenty of money
02:51:57.800 for Ukraine not even like like how are
02:52:01.359 we H allowed to have a foreign
02:52:05.760 policy when we are violating the
02:52:09.520 policies
02:52:11.359 here right you see what I'm saying like
02:52:15.600 like
02:52:17.319 what what what do you mean the
02:52:19.479 immigrants are getting a check and we're
02:52:21.640 putting them up in places that
02:52:26.920 what you mean in the homeless people's
02:52:29.760 face right in the homeless people's
02:52:32.160 faces like right let us show you what we
02:52:36.120 could have done
02:52:38.279 right wow crazy that's not okay as a
02:52:42.680 society no
02:52:45.239 well did you see the the scam that they
02:52:47.319 were trying to do in New York City where
02:52:49.120 they were trying to give them debit
02:52:50.200 cards for $10,000 but there's people
02:52:52.160 getting Cuts all along the way that
02:52:54.760 wasn't a scam that was business that got
02:52:57.880 uncovered and I'll prove it to you when
02:53:00.920 you go to like if you go to jail in New
02:53:04.239 York everybody goes to Riker's Island so
02:53:06.760 I was in Riker's Island so if you got if
02:53:10.000 you got money on you when you go in they
02:53:12.399 give you a card when you leaving and
02:53:14.880 it's got money on it your amount like
02:53:18.720 systems are the system
02:53:23.359 like right yeah there a lot of money
02:53:26.359 being made yeah a lot of money being
02:53:28.520 tossed around the system and if you have
02:53:31.120 a thing like an open immigration policy
02:53:33.439 for sure someone's figuring out how to
02:53:36.040 profit off that someone's figuring out
02:53:38.560 something about that no no you're
02:53:40.680 looking at it the wrong way there is no
02:53:43.120 one who isn't profit
02:53:45.239 profiting everyone's profiting I'm
02:53:47.439 saying how ridiculous is it for you to
02:53:52.760 think you have the greatest country in
02:53:55.399 the world and then it not be a big deal
02:53:58.960 to get
02:54:00.760 there of
02:54:02.760 course what do you mean of course this
02:54:05.880 is the hunt the the the bees saying why
02:54:09.120 do they love our honey so much right
02:54:12.560 well no one's shocked at that would
02:54:14.399 people are shocked at is that there's no
02:54:16.200 effort whatsoever to stop the stem of
02:54:18.520 illegal immigration that's what people
02:54:20.640 are freaked out about like it seems like
02:54:22.160 we're not freaked out about the loss of
02:54:24.720 bees I am if all the bees are gone we're
02:54:28.479 going to die as a civilization because
02:54:31.600 we didn't protect one of the most
02:54:34.359 important insects in the whole ecosystem
02:54:38.239 right so you know and they think cell
02:54:41.160 phone signals are [ __ ] them up
02:54:43.279 too
02:54:45.600 well you imagine you've been a bee
02:54:47.640 forever then all a sudden someone cell
02:54:49.560 phone signals
02:54:51.319 everywhere this is part of the purpose
02:54:54.800 of religion in
02:54:57.120 society is to try to get you away
02:55:02.760 from exploring all of the things you
02:55:06.359 could be doing with your time and put it
02:55:10.120 somewhere that's
02:55:12.640 healthier like what do you mean
02:55:16.960 like principles of meditation and you
02:55:22.439 know believing that you should be trying
02:55:26.080 to do a good job and being nice you know
02:55:29.720 because it's not really that profitable
02:55:32.319 right but here we are talking about you
02:55:35.160 know that's what really will help our
02:55:37.960 country and civilization if we treated
02:55:41.359 the
02:55:42.720 downtrodden better but the truth is it's
02:55:46.880 very little money in that
02:55:49.600 yeah it's very little money in that the
02:55:52.880 truth is that the immigrants that come
02:55:55.000 over here are generally super qualified
02:55:58.120 at something yeah and motivated
02:56:01.359 and I mean [ __ ] if I just walked here
02:56:05.479 that's what's made all immigration
02:56:08.640 important um you know what I mean like
02:56:11.530 [Music]
02:56:13.120 um the the Mexican people
02:56:20.080 were the second or well they were their
02:56:24.439 own jolt to the civilization of the fact
02:56:27.840 that yeah you say oh they shouldn't come
02:56:30.399 over but anybody that comes over willing
02:56:34.520 to work hard and succeed
02:56:38.640 and those are people you want a part and
02:56:42.399 they immediately help like you can look
02:56:45.800 at the extremes of course but um the
02:56:50.880 benefit um are
02:56:53.720 astronomical and always have been
02:56:56.920 since
02:56:58.479 Pangia yeah the benefits are great the
02:57:01.120 side effects are crime and that's what
02:57:03.520 you have to be careful of especially
02:57:05.120 when you got organized crime that's
02:57:06.319 coming in self fenel you got a lot of
02:57:08.640 that that's a that's a wild one cuz that
02:57:11.680 that's propped up by laws that's po up
02:57:14.359 by our drug laws and that that puts you
02:57:16.760 in a real complicated situation like do
02:57:18.640 you make drugs legal everything
02:57:20.239 everything legal the problem is you're
02:57:21.520 going to get a bunch of people that get
02:57:22.520 addicted to drugs that probably wouldn't
02:57:24.120 without that and then you have to say is
02:57:25.920 that just part of the process we have to
02:57:27.359 learn to deal with this new thing that's
02:57:29.399 everywhere and and readily available and
02:57:31.680 how many people are going to try it just
02:57:32.720 because it's legal probably quite a few
02:57:35.239 but at least how many people are not
02:57:36.439 going to die from fenal poisoning
02:57:38.239 because they're going to get pure stuff
02:57:40.160 probably a
02:57:42.359 lot uh
02:57:46.040 yeah that well talking fentel in
02:57:49.479 specific like it's a very difficult
02:57:51.720 conversation to have because most of the
02:57:54.960 things that we will all agree are
02:57:57.640 terrible drugs aren't being used at the
02:58:02.279 hospital right so until that part gets
02:58:07.600 um take like it's it's a bad look all
02:58:10.200 the way around but but the bar has been
02:58:13.120 set so high
02:58:15.160 like everything that's called a drug
02:58:16.960 nowadays is
02:58:18.510 [Laughter]
02:58:22.080 terrible like there's been no
02:58:25.160 Evolution like yikes well that's part of
02:58:28.920 the problem with keeping drugs illegal
02:58:31.000 and especially psychedelic drugs since
02:58:33.200 1970 it's like styed human evolution
02:58:36.560 styed research styed growth what did
02:58:39.720 keeping drugs illegal keeping
02:58:41.399 psychedelic drugs illegal look if there
02:58:44.439 psychelic TRS if there was a God then he
02:58:48.399 put a fail
02:58:50.200 safe on the drug so that you would have
02:58:55.720 a barrier and that's Richard Nixon
02:58:59.200 that's oh that's odan odan yeah right
02:59:02.640 with those drugs right so really what's
02:59:04.880 happening is you're like
02:59:06.880 okay whatever you're on do it to your
02:59:10.560 dead and so you know um statistically
02:59:15.560 that's going to happen you going to lose
02:59:17.200 some people but the people that's not
02:59:19.239 doing it they're not going to start
02:59:20.560 doing it like right they're going to
02:59:21.720 learn from the people that died like you
02:59:24.080 learn to not eat poisonous plants you
02:59:25.920 would think but if that were true nobody
02:59:28.560 in the world would ever do heroin like
02:59:31.439 if you've ever seen somebody kick it
02:59:34.720 like you would never do it like it
02:59:37.399 doesn't matter how it makes you feel if
02:59:41.000 the end result
02:59:42.840 is defecating and urinating in a puddle
02:59:46.680 that you're laying in while being naked
02:59:49.200 then like
02:59:51.000 you
02:59:52.680 like true you would just call that
02:59:55.920 poisonous if you were
02:59:58.640 smart yeah you would learn you would
03:00:01.439 learn from other people doing it and
03:00:03.239 that's the thing it's like we're
03:00:04.520 reluctant to allow
03:00:07.000 that factor into people's lives but kind
03:00:10.359 of have with a lot of other factors well
03:00:12.479 a lot of these things were you
03:00:14.279 sparingly and in context as well you
03:00:17.600 find what I'm saying so so particularly
03:00:21.680 all psychedelics they were used in a
03:00:23.200 ritualistic way but but that's like us
03:00:26.640 saying you know while in that cooking
03:00:28.960 show they were using herbs and
03:00:32.040 spices like yeah that goes with it right
03:00:35.160 like right if somebody tells you that
03:00:37.560 when they used to come through with the
03:00:40.520 ball and the smoke and the incense that
03:00:43.120 at one point point it was marijuana
03:00:46.800 right understand
03:00:51.399 that it was setting the mood of the room
03:00:55.760 like yeah you know what I mean like
03:01:00.200 um that's how you know there is an Ault
03:01:04.239 how could there not be there's another
03:01:06.760 side to
03:01:08.000 everything um universally
03:01:12.479 so yeah yeah that must have been a wild
03:01:14.880 time in church everybody just got
03:01:16.960 contact high people walking down the
03:01:19.439 aisles with balls filled with marijuana
03:01:22.319 smoke well it understand this is not
03:01:25.840 being consistently done this is being
03:01:29.319 done right you know what I mean and so
03:01:33.000 there's no such thing as you getting too
03:01:35.319 much of it you're not getting enough to
03:01:37.960 do anything except relax right and relax
03:01:42.120 is what you should be doing and as we
03:01:44.439 discuss what we're discussing yeah it'll
03:01:46.600 humble you a little calm you down a
03:01:49.000 little it'll take the edge off you're
03:01:51.399 not you're not getting enough um to have
03:01:54.960 the munchies and if you do we'll
03:01:56.880 probably have a little something for
03:02:00.160 yeah I don't
03:02:01.720 know but I'm saying all throughout
03:02:07.120 history people have been searching for
03:02:09.880 this connection and and we don't have
03:02:13.160 histor Al any evidence of any groups of
03:02:16.920 people doing it doing something for no
03:02:19.439 reason right there was a element to this
03:02:24.760 so when we have the stories
03:02:27.000 of we went in this cave and um crazy
03:02:32.200 [ __ ] was down there and like we now know
03:02:35.920 that a lot of that existed like the air
03:02:38.640 is not the same down there like it might
03:02:40.840 have been a poisonous gas in there and
03:02:43.800 know that you
03:02:46.279 know these were things that were not
03:02:48.680 known then so
03:02:52.880 um it's just fascinating to see the
03:02:56.200 stories where we are now and to see how
03:02:59.520 advanced they were on these particular
03:03:02.880 subjects and that time weeded out
03:03:07.200 the BS stories really
03:03:10.479 well yeah there's probably something to
03:03:13.239 all with them there probably something
03:03:15.279 to all stories from all
03:03:18.160 cultures a reason why they would want to
03:03:20.200 tell them over and over and over again
03:03:21.680 mhm one of the criteria for it to last
03:03:24.720 over time like that's what I understood
03:03:32.880 um when I broke the
03:03:36.000 internet I was trying I I let me see if
03:03:40.560 you know like when you start studying
03:03:43.479 quotes and where great quotes come from
03:03:46.520 you start getting these people that are
03:03:49.479 known for their great quotes right but
03:03:52.760 the further you go back you see who
03:03:55.880 really said it first you know what I
03:03:58.840 mean and that's what brings it full
03:04:02.040 circle to that Emerald Tablet I was
03:04:06.000 telling you about right
03:04:09.359 because 70% of
03:04:12.399 it
03:04:14.120 is something you've
03:04:16.439 heard somewhere
03:04:19.200 else well I can't wait to read it I
03:04:22.120 wasn't even aware of it but it totally
03:04:24.479 makes sense like there are things in it
03:04:26.720 that
