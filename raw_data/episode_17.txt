00:00:41.760 accident how's that happened it's kona
00:00:44.960 blue you familiar with this no Kona BL

00:01:02.760 I'll just I don't do email or what I
00:01:04.879 don't know how to airdrop anything you
00:01:06.280 don't do email
00:01:08.840 no I haven't done email in many years
00:01:11.560 really yeah how do you exist I do text

00:01:35.680 I did I think I did it didn't get to me
00:01:40.119 yeah it just s it'll it's a big thing
00:01:43.840 um okay
00:01:45.640 so this is so amazing so this is in
00:01:49.719 there they're talking about this and
00:01:51.439 this was just released talking about
00:01:54.159 setting up this program kona blue I
00:01:55.920 didn't get it uh this is like a UAP
00:01:58.960 program of some the medical division
00:02:01.320 will have a small team of medical
00:02:03.240 analysts under the direction of the
00:02:05.000 chief physician and Deputy Administrator
00:02:07.280 they will organized data into a threat
00:02:09.000 analysis based on medical findings
00:02:11.239 including but not limited to a deaths
00:02:13.840 and injuries as a result of interaction
00:02:16.280 with Advanced Aerospace Vehicles here it
00:02:18.480 is B Medical injuries as a result of
00:02:21.360 other anomalies C collateral injuries
00:02:24.000 psychological effects to family members
00:02:25.680 so they're admitting that people are
00:02:27.280 dying
00:02:30.400 this just like a tweet from yes is this
00:02:33.200 it a day or
00:02:34.840 twoo what does that mean other
00:02:39.800 information do you ever wonder if stuff
00:02:41.760 like this is just
00:02:42.920 disinformation yeah
00:02:44.640 maybe I mean I I wonder if I wonder a
00:02:48.959 lot of things I'm sure you do but um I
00:02:53.560 would always always assume that a lot of
00:02:56.239 this stuff is
00:02:57.599 nonsense yeah here's what we know
00:03:00.360 is
00:03:01.480 that US servicemen have died as a result
00:03:06.640 of contact with or being in the
00:03:08.360 proximity of these vehicles and we know
00:03:11.760 that because there are a lot of Suits
00:03:13.000 working their way through the VA system
00:03:15.760 yeah where families you know can't get
00:03:20.040 compensated for the deaths or injuries
00:03:21.720 to loved ones because it's all under
00:03:24.920 wraps top secret well that's just that's
00:03:27.799 just a fact okay that that is happening
00:03:29.920 so if there's I guess you know when
00:03:32.360 there are measurable physical effects of
00:03:34.319 a phenomenon we can say conclusively the
00:03:36.519 phenomenon is real right and
00:03:39.680 um so yeah I mean it is real I mean I
00:03:42.640 guess we're sort of past the point of
00:03:44.040 like is it real yeah it's real it's it's
00:03:47.040 real in that there's these things that
00:03:49.959 are moving in very bizarre ways and they
00:03:53.120 have these propulsion systems that
00:03:55.840 violate what we know about propulsion
00:03:58.680 systems
00:04:00.720 retrieving data across dimensional
00:04:03.400 SpaceTime develop remote viewing coms
00:04:06.400 and count countermeasures determined
00:04:09.480 Baseline for physical transport across
00:04:11.360 dimensional space-time barrier rapid
00:04:13.840 response Medical Teams for UFO
00:04:15.560 interaction events so how do they do
00:04:17.759 this accidentally study conscious
00:04:20.639 interactions with and control of
00:04:24.440 technology so I got this from someone in
00:04:26.840 the US government who's who's who's well
00:04:29.479 well
00:04:30.639 look let me let me just start by saying
00:04:32.320 I you know I don't know anything um
00:04:37.160 but he sent me this the above is 100%
00:04:40.160 legit I was read into this program but
00:04:42.000 told never to tell anyone it's now been
00:04:43.520 released as you can see um it began as a
00:04:46.919 result of my old program a
00:04:52.199 AIP um I signed a document saying I
00:04:54.560 would never talk about Kona and similar
00:04:56.280 efforts I can't believe that a would
00:04:58.199 have released it
00:05:01.560 look I I you know yeah I mean here's
00:05:04.080 what we do know is that there's enough
00:05:07.080 going on in the skies but not just the
00:05:09.320 skies underwater that U the US military
00:05:13.680 has been forced to respond to it so like
00:05:16.680 move aircraft from one place to another
00:05:19.160 because there are too many of these
00:05:20.440 objects in the sky that's actually
00:05:22.199 happened Chris melon just wrote a long
00:05:23.400 piece about it um so it's real the
00:05:27.240 government is not controlling it in fact
00:05:31.240 it's forcing the government DOD to
00:05:34.479 respond um and we know that there is a a
00:05:38.960 real effort and has been underway for a
00:05:40.600 long time to to keep the public from
00:05:42.960 knowing about it but that's all known
00:05:45.319 that's established I don't think any
00:05:47.360 rational person would deny that the
00:05:49.360 question is like what is it actually I
00:05:51.240 mean now is sort of the point you have
00:05:52.360 to ask like what is
00:05:54.000 this and
00:05:56.560 um you know so that's how much of do you
00:05:59.199 think is out
00:06:00.199 ours well none of it's ours none of it
00:06:03.479 well I don't know I mean clearly you
00:06:05.479 know the US government is huge it's the
00:06:06.919 largest human organization there are I
00:06:09.319 think then I think there are 2 million
00:06:11.880 federal employees and another 10 million
00:06:13.880 Federal contractors so who are
00:06:15.599 effectively government employees but
00:06:17.000 don't have Civil Service protection for
00:06:19.440 example um so that's 12 million people
00:06:22.919 in a country of 340 million working for
00:06:25.199 the federal government so it's kind of
00:06:26.759 hard to overstate how big the federal
00:06:28.479 government is and how well-funded and so
00:06:32.080 to say the government this the
00:06:33.240 government that no of course it's people
00:06:34.840 within the government um but yeah
00:06:37.599 they're working on all kinds of things
00:06:40.240 obviously uh that are
00:06:42.759 classified but in general no they they
00:06:46.560 can't control these objects uh so no
00:06:50.160 it's not American Technology well or
00:06:53.160 Russian or Chinese it
00:06:55.120 predates you know all of that well some
00:06:58.000 of it does right like for sure the
00:06:59.759 Kenneth Arnold sightings that was really
00:07:02.360 early on that was like the 19 early
00:07:04.759 1950s he was seeing these flying saucers
00:07:07.479 these discs that were moving over
00:07:09.319 mountains well right I mean the prophet
00:07:11.759 Ezekiel writes about it in the first
00:07:13.319 chapter wheels in the sky yeah that's a
00:07:15.720 crazy one boy when you read that well it
00:07:17.440 is crazy if you if you read it it's like
00:07:19.440 oh wow you know
00:07:21.840 Andel not just you know the Hebrew
00:07:24.120 scriptures like it's all over every mhm
00:07:26.840 the viic textas of course so the These
00:07:29.599 Are Spiritual phenomenon there's no
00:07:30.960 evidence they're from another planet I
00:07:32.520 mean I think that's the op that's the
00:07:34.280 lie that they're from Mars look space
00:07:38.960 the atmosphere is really well monitored
00:07:41.240 right both for military for defense
00:07:44.080 reasons but also because like it' be
00:07:45.879 nice to know when asteroids are coming
00:07:48.000 and there's no evidence has never been
00:07:49.560 any evidence that there are lots of
00:07:50.759 these objects these vehicles coming into
00:07:53.120 our atmosphere from somewhere else some
00:07:54.639 other planet there's no evidence of that
00:07:56.000 at all H so they're from here and
00:07:59.879 they've been here for thousands of years
00:08:01.599 whatever they are and um it's pretty
00:08:04.759 clear to me that they're spiritual
00:08:06.360 entities whatever that means are
00:08:08.080 Supernatural and which is to say
00:08:10.400 Supernaturals means above the natural
00:08:12.840 above the
00:08:13.960 observable uh nature and um they don't
00:08:18.560 behave according to the laws of science
00:08:22.360 as as measured by people you know and um
00:08:27.240 and they've been here for a long time
00:08:29.039 and there's a ton of evidence that are
00:08:30.319 under the ocean and under the ground so
00:08:32.120 like with that fact set what do you
00:08:33.919 conclude when did you start having this
00:08:36.760 opinion that they they were spiritual
00:08:40.080 and that they've always been here like
00:08:41.640 when when did this well I didn't know
00:08:42.880 anything about the topic until
00:08:45.240 2017 and like was that after the New
00:08:47.640 York Times piece no it was before it was
00:08:50.640 before and the things that I saw I mean
00:08:52.959 like I was and am still a very
00:08:55.160 conventional person I mean I'm 54 I grew
00:08:57.360 up in this country in California which
00:08:58.880 was like
00:09:00.160 like every assumption about America I
00:09:02.519 bought completely just completely and I
00:09:06.079 thought that everyone who questioned
00:09:07.959 those assumptions was bad I just bought
00:09:10.839 into the system completely without even
00:09:12.399 thinking about it and I imagined that I
00:09:13.959 was like some kind of freeth thinker and
00:09:15.680 you know I'm going against the grain but
00:09:17.320 like thee my core assumptions were the
00:09:20.079 you know the assumptions fed to me by
00:09:22.000 the culture and the government and I
00:09:23.399 didn't even realize it but anyway I'd
00:09:24.800 never really thought about UFOs at all
00:09:27.000 and I've been in journalism since I was
00:09:28.959 a kid of course I'd run into a lot of
00:09:30.560 people who had crazy views on a lot of
00:09:32.760 different topics UFOs 911 circumcision
00:09:36.600 you know like every whack job in the
00:09:37.920 world you run into when you're covering
00:09:39.480 stuff fluoride fluoride right I just
00:09:42.959 brushed with non fluoride toothpaste
00:09:44.519 this morning me too um
00:09:48.079 exactly exactly but probably unlike you
00:09:52.040 I didn't have any opinions like that I
00:09:54.440 was like fluide come on you know 911
00:09:58.279 shut up
00:09:59.880 UFOs you're [ __ ] crazy you know what
00:10:01.800 I mean I just like I had this reflex I'm
00:10:03.880 ashamed of it I'm not bragging about it
00:10:05.600 but um but it was it was 2017 and really
00:10:08.480 it was the Trump campaign it wasn't that
00:10:10.560 I was like so in love with Trump though
00:10:12.360 I've always liked Trump because you know
00:10:13.920 he's like hilarious and charming and all
00:10:15.399 that but I wasn't like a Trumper or
00:10:18.399 anything um but it was watching that
00:10:22.200 campaign and particularly his claim that
00:10:24.880 they were spying on him and I was like
00:10:26.480 really there not the Intel service and
00:10:30.000 federal law enforcement FBI do not spy
00:10:31.880 on presidential campaigns like that's so
00:10:34.480 out of the realm that's so crazy like
00:10:36.880 that could never happen because of
00:10:38.399 course there's no democracy in a system
00:10:40.440 like that and fundamentally we democracy
00:10:42.519 an imperfect one it kind of Lumbers
00:10:44.519 along you know but like it's not
00:10:47.040 fake and and then that turned out to be
00:10:49.519 true and I and I knew it was true and
00:10:52.639 that just blew my mind so I began a
00:10:55.120 process still ongoing of reassessing a
00:10:56.920 lot of other things like okay well if
00:10:59.079 that was not true what else is not true
00:11:01.200 and what else that they told me was a
00:11:03.560 conspiracy theory might actually have
00:11:05.320 some basis in fact and um and then
00:11:08.560 someone from you know a DOD employee
00:11:11.160 reached out to me and said actually
00:11:13.000 there's a ton of evidence that this UFO
00:11:14.760 thing is
00:11:15.600 real and really and so I started doing
00:11:18.600 segments on it um when I worked at at
00:11:21.440 the TV channel and uh and there was like
00:11:24.480 a lot of mockery but I was like I don't
00:11:26.160 care I'm just going to do this and then
00:11:27.519 of course the second you start you know
00:11:30.040 better than anybody you start talking
00:11:31.440 about something then people reach out to
00:11:32.880 you and some of them are deranged but
00:11:34.839 some of them aren't at all so I just
00:11:37.959 started getting a lot of information
00:11:39.959 from people and meeting with people
00:11:41.639 mostly in private you know come to my
00:11:43.240 house let's talk
00:11:44.800 and and I decided on the basis of what
00:11:48.040 they told me and then I talked to a lot
00:11:49.480 of people about it um that actually this
00:11:52.200 is really a very heavyduty question
00:11:55.279 actually it's not just it's not the
00:11:56.880 little green men question it's like a
00:11:58.240 much bigger question
00:12:00.000 and it's really bad it's really dark and
00:12:02.360 and then I stopped then I was like I
00:12:03.880 don't want to know anymore because it's
00:12:05.279 not helping me um at all as a person and
00:12:08.440 I what information did you get that made
00:12:10.959 you feel like it's
00:12:12.279 dark it's so dark well first of all the
00:12:15.000 deception is always bad like lying is
00:12:17.160 bad in it and it's bad not just in a
00:12:19.639 legal sense in that it can be illegal to
00:12:22.079 lie but it's bad it's like bad for you
00:12:24.680 like it rots you like being a liar makes
00:12:28.040 you a bad person when you lie you are
00:12:30.279 serving evil there's a moral quality to
00:12:32.279 it that's
00:12:33.199 inescapable and very obvious and only
00:12:35.839 like advanced advanced civilizations
00:12:38.519 ignore that lying is bad and so if you
00:12:41.519 have lying at scale which we have on
00:12:44.279 this topic it's inherently bad okay so
00:12:46.160 that's the first level the deeper level
00:12:48.440 is what are okay so if they're Spiritual
00:12:51.040 Beings which I believe they
00:12:52.880 are like it's a binary they're either
00:12:56.199 you know you're on team good or team bad
00:12:58.519 you can assign any name to it you want
00:13:00.440 but like what are these things are they
00:13:02.480 good or bad and um and I think some of
00:13:05.920 them are bad and if the US government
00:13:08.839 knows that or part elements the people
00:13:10.480 within the US government know that then
00:13:14.440 you know then they're serving a bad
00:13:16.360 force and well when you say spiritual
00:13:18.920 like what what makes you draw that
00:13:20.639 conclusion that they're spiritual what's
00:13:22.160 the OB I mean spiritual maybe the wrong
00:13:23.480 word Supernatural you know they're
00:13:25.279 beyond nature as we understand it I mean
00:13:28.279 obviously they are I mean just chart
00:13:30.079 their physical Behavior it doesn't you
00:13:32.279 know it goes outside of what we
00:13:34.360 understand about
00:13:35.560 physics no visible means of propulsion
00:13:38.639 you know coming at Indescribable speed
00:13:41.360 hitting the ocean continuing at speeds
00:13:43.399 that are impossible under sea I mean in
00:13:46.160 other words if I if I take a you know 9
00:13:48.320 mimet r or 762 x 39 and shoot you at 50
00:13:52.040 yards underwater and a swimming pool and
00:13:53.920 it's even more intense in salt water
00:13:55.240 because it's denser you could catch the
00:13:57.399 bullet if it even makes it to you right
00:13:59.360 so if you have a craft any object
00:14:02.360 underwater that's traveling at 500 knots
00:14:05.000 as measured by sonar right there you're
00:14:06.680 challenging our understanding physics
00:14:08.199 like what is that how can that be so
00:14:11.480 they've they've tracked that they've
00:14:12.800 tracked things going 500 knots Under the
00:14:15.920 Sea yeah really yeah much much faster
00:14:18.959 than any object could can actually go
00:14:21.160 under under SE yo for
00:14:23.120 sure oh yeah there's a lot of stuff
00:14:25.920 going on
00:14:27.040 underwater and um
00:14:29.680 a lot and there's video of these things
00:14:32.279 coming out of the sky into the water and
00:14:35.399 also emerging from the water right yeah
00:14:39.079 so it's all so blurry though I don't
00:14:42.160 think it's trans medium
00:14:44.720 video yeah I don't think some of it's
00:14:46.600 that blurry I think some of it's Crystal
00:14:48.199 Clear um we just don't have access to it
00:14:50.720 is that what you mean just we haven't
00:14:52.120 seen itre so they have some stuff for
00:14:54.560 sure so but there's just a lot going on
00:14:56.639 under water and it's it's measured and
00:14:58.399 so whatever I mean these are all again
00:15:00.560 this is like the most obvious observable
00:15:02.639 level of it but then you just ask
00:15:04.079 yourself like what is this
00:15:06.560 actually and you know if there's been
00:15:08.920 extensive knowledge of this for decades
00:15:11.320 like maybe 80 years at least if not
00:15:14.279 going back to the 30s 90 years um you
00:15:18.040 know to what to what end so there are
00:15:19.720 two possible explanations obvious
00:15:22.000 explanations the first is the one you
00:15:24.000 often hear which is this is so
00:15:26.360 heavy that if the public were to know
00:15:28.759 about it it would be just disruptive it'
00:15:30.759 be too scary like you don't want to
00:15:32.160 scare people for no good reason there's
00:15:33.759 nothing we can do about it and you also
00:15:35.839 don't want to suggest that you know the
00:15:37.720 US military isn't capable of protecting
00:15:40.639 the country the
00:15:41.800 Homeland um and it does suggest that if
00:15:44.160 you can't control these objects in your
00:15:45.560 airspace and that's known they can't
00:15:48.440 that's known okay then that's just a
00:15:51.480 limit to the power of the US Military
00:15:52.800 and you don't want to tell people that
00:15:54.759 because then they like won't believe
00:15:55.920 that they're safe I get it
00:15:59.279 but then there's a deeper level which is
00:16:01.240 like okay what's your relationship with
00:16:03.920 these
00:16:04.680 things what is the US government's
00:16:07.000 relationship with these things and
00:16:09.319 there's evidence that there is a
00:16:10.600 relationship and that it's a
00:16:12.759 longstanding and that raises like a lot
00:16:14.959 of questions about intent and um and so
00:16:19.360 like what is that and I just personally
00:16:21.880 decided um you know and and people have
00:16:25.079 been hurt by these things you know
00:16:26.600 that's a fact that's a fact it's a no
00:16:29.199 fact it's a provable fact and killed and
00:16:33.040 I'm not saying millions of people have
00:16:34.199 been killed by whatever these things are
00:16:35.759 but people have been killed and it's
00:16:37.000 known because it's working its way
00:16:38.680 through the courts out of the VA so um I
00:16:42.680 don't know an object that is by
00:16:46.120 definition Supernatural it's above the
00:16:48.519 laws of nature as we understand them and
00:16:51.040 that has resulted in the deaths of
00:16:54.880 people we don't spend enough time
00:16:56.639 thinking about like what that adds up to
00:16:58.199 like not good actually not good how many
00:17:01.079 people do you think have died from these
00:17:02.720 I don't know but I mean I and is it
00:17:05.160 radiation sickness is it like what what
00:17:07.599 is what's the so the person that I
00:17:09.919 talked to I interviewed someone who was
00:17:11.959 a Stanford Medical School Professor
00:17:13.640 who's who's out there and worth talking
00:17:15.160 to by the way and a um talking about
00:17:18.000 Gary Nolan that's exactly who I'm
00:17:19.520 talking about who's effectively an
00:17:21.480 expert witness in these cases so he's an
00:17:23.119 expert in brain injury do you know him
00:17:25.119 yeah yeah entirely credible person um
00:17:28.919 checks all the boxes that I care about
00:17:30.760 he's he's got patents so he's like a lot
00:17:33.320 of Stanford University professors he's
00:17:34.640 like independently Rich he flew to I
00:17:37.200 live in a remote place and he flew to my
00:17:40.120 place at his own expense because he
00:17:41.280 wanted to tell the story so he he's got
00:17:43.240 no profit motive here he's the most
00:17:46.200 highly credentialed person at the
00:17:48.480 University practically Stanford Medical
00:17:50.760 School we consider that a big deal uh
00:17:54.559 and he's worked on this for you know
00:17:56.400 over 10 years um assess ing the injuries
00:18:00.039 to US
00:18:01.559 servicemen from being in close proximity
00:18:05.480 to these objects or having contact with
00:18:07.080 these objects and his conclusion as you
00:18:09.760 know because you've talked to him is
00:18:11.039 that there's some kind of energy coming
00:18:12.320 off here that scrambles people's brains
00:18:13.760 or kills them and it's not exactly
00:18:17.200 radiation um at least in his telling to
00:18:19.360 me so anyway but the point is people
00:18:22.280 have
00:18:23.120 died yeah
00:18:25.480 and so you know it it does raise a lot
00:18:29.640 of a lot of questions about like what
00:18:31.640 the hell right what the hell American
00:18:34.039 citizens have died and you're hiding it
00:18:36.240 why are you hiding that why would you
00:18:37.799 hide
00:18:38.640 that perhaps because they don't have any
00:18:40.840 explanations because they they're it's
00:18:43.840 so beyond our comprehension that they're
00:18:46.799 still trying to piece it together like I
00:18:48.679 would wonder how much interaction they
00:18:51.440 really do have with these things like if
00:18:54.039 I was from another planet or if I was
00:18:56.440 some interdimensional being I don't know
00:19:00.000 how much I'd give a [ __ ] about the
00:19:01.919 president I don't know how much I'd give
00:19:04.240 a [ __ ] about the government I would
00:19:06.200 probably look at this infantile race
00:19:09.799 this species this
00:19:12.400 bizarre territorial Apes with
00:19:14.840 thermonuclear weapons this very weird
00:19:17.799 species I I'd probably look at them as
00:19:19.799 very chaotic and uh I wouldn't really
00:19:22.600 have much concern for who's running
00:19:25.559 it especially if they have the ability
00:19:27.919 to travel at insane speeds and go
00:19:31.760 undetected
00:19:33.640 and well it depends like that okay so
00:19:36.400 the template that you're using to
00:19:38.240 understand this is like science fiction
00:19:39.799 right these are an advanced race of
00:19:42.039 beings from somewhere else but the
00:19:44.320 template that every other Society before
00:19:46.039 us has used is a spiritual one there is
00:19:48.679 a whole world that we can't see that
00:19:50.919 acts on people a supernal world it's
00:19:53.600 acting on us all the time for good and
00:19:55.240 bad every society has thought this
00:19:57.360 before ours in fact every society in all
00:19:59.760 recorded history has thought that until
00:20:02.360 I'll be specific August 1945 When we
00:20:05.039 dropped the atom bombs on hoshima
00:20:06.600 Nagasaki and all of a sudden the West is
00:20:08.640 just officially secular we're God there
00:20:10.320 is no God but us and that's the world
00:20:13.120 that we have grown up in but that's an
00:20:14.360 anomally like no one else has ever
00:20:16.039 thought that there's never been a
00:20:17.760 society that thought that every other
00:20:19.679 Society has assumed and they've had all
00:20:21.640 kinds of different explanations and the
00:20:22.840 details differ but the core idea does
00:20:25.360 not differ and never has differed from
00:20:27.159 caves until now that we're being acted
00:20:30.640 on by spiritual forces at all times and
00:20:34.520 so to someone born before or living
00:20:37.120 before 1945 I think it would have been
00:20:39.400 much more
00:20:40.480 obvious that this is the thing that
00:20:42.919 every society has written about and in
00:20:46.159 fact that battle that unseen battle
00:20:49.480 around us that spiritual battle has like
00:20:52.679 been the basis of every society of every
00:20:55.039 Rel every religion not just Christianity
00:20:57.440 so like it just once you discard your
00:21:02.600 very very recent assumptions relatively
00:21:04.919 speaking about how the world Works
00:21:07.159 you're like well that kind of seems like
00:21:08.600 the obvious explanation right H it's not
00:21:11.679 that obvious to
00:21:13.360 me so what's what's more obvious do you
00:21:17.080 think well I I I don't think there's an
00:21:19.960 obvious explanation I think if I had to
00:21:23.559 guess some of this stuff is ours and
00:21:26.440 some of these things are propulsion
00:21:28.760 systems that they theorized way back in
00:21:31.400 the 1950s anti-gravity propulsion
00:21:34.200 systems things that can operate without
00:21:37.360 igniting Fuel and pushing something out
00:21:40.159 that they operate in some completely
00:21:42.360 different way that utilizes gravity and
00:21:45.679 almost can instantaneously transport to
00:21:48.039 new places essentially fold space
00:21:51.279 time um I don't
00:21:54.520 know so there there's there's things
00:21:57.000 that the government does
00:21:59.400 where they have these
00:22:02.799 programs and the people that are sworn
00:22:05.279 into these programs whether they the
00:22:06.919 physicists or you know the metallurgists
00:22:09.480 or whoever these people are that are
00:22:10.720 working on these programs they don't
00:22:12.520 tell anybody all their phones are
00:22:14.240 monitored everything's monitored there's
00:22:16.080 a so there's a culture of secre ism
00:22:18.840 that's pretty intense and it's not
00:22:22.080 inconceivable that over the course of
00:22:24.760 the last 70 plus years of them
00:22:27.159 theorizing
00:22:28.760 and then eventually implementing some of
00:22:31.720 these things that they've developed
00:22:33.520 drones that could move in ways that this
00:22:37.760 the conventional the people that
00:22:40.279 understand conventional propulsion
00:22:41.720 systems could not imagine and that they
00:22:44.559 figured out a way to do this and to keep
00:22:46.240 it secret and we're probably not the
00:22:48.679 only ones work on these
00:22:50.480 things but where did they get that
00:22:53.080 information and you know have you know
00:22:56.000 Diana Pula you know her work like they
00:22:59.039 they describe these crafts these crash
00:23:01.440 crafts as donations which is fascinating
00:23:05.200 like that they're left there the crashed
00:23:07.600 retrieval program the crashed UAP
00:23:10.360 retrieval program is essentially they're
00:23:12.799 going like figure this out we're going
00:23:15.120 to crash this thing here you figure this
00:23:16.640 out and the question is if that's true
00:23:19.840 okay where are these things coming from
00:23:21.840 are they if if there's something that is
00:23:24.760 so Advanced that it's decided to leave
00:23:27.440 us a little Trinket for us to back
00:23:29.799 engineer is that from another dimension
00:23:32.960 is that from here is that from some
00:23:36.080 realm that we just don't have access to
00:23:39.320 is it from another planet are we we have
00:23:42.360 drones that are on other planets right
00:23:44.080 now we have a drone on Mars we have you
00:23:46.240 know the lunar Rovers we have satellites
00:23:48.679 that we send to observe and photograph
00:23:51.159 other planets we just got really high
00:23:53.600 detailed photographs of Jupiter they're
00:23:55.400 pretty amazing but if something was like
00:23:59.799 us on another planet and but lived
00:24:04.400 uninterrupted with technology advancing
00:24:07.600 for a thousand years 10,000 years a
00:24:10.360 million years more than us what would
00:24:12.480 that be like and how much would we be
00:24:14.880 able to understand of what we're seeing
00:24:17.480 what would be what would be we be able
00:24:19.279 to see and this idea that we monitor our
00:24:21.840 skies sure but if something just appears
00:24:24.679 and disappears essentially
00:24:26.720 instantaneously if something literally
00:24:29.159 can fold time can fold space and just
00:24:33.120 tra Traverse between immense distances
00:24:36.640 almost
00:24:38.000 instantaneously what are we going to see
00:24:40.640 what are we going to see and also like
00:24:42.760 what kind of detection systems do we
00:24:44.720 have we have radar we have visual we
00:24:47.039 have uh a bunch of different
00:24:49.200 military-based detection systems to look
00:24:51.440 out for enemy crafts and airships and
00:24:55.279 all that stuff but if you're dealing
00:24:57.360 with something that's a million years
00:24:59.440 more advanced than us how much would we
00:25:01.480 we be able to detect well so I I think
00:25:04.120 we're pointing to the same question I
00:25:05.520 mean I have no doubt that the US
00:25:06.960 government has technology that we don't
00:25:08.640 know the details of that makes sense
00:25:10.320 sure but like where did it come from
00:25:13.279 right um I'm not even sure this is a
00:25:16.240 separate question but related not sure
00:25:18.600 we really know where nuclear technology
00:25:20.919 came from um actually when you really
00:25:23.880 yes like the Manhattan Project yeah like
00:25:27.200 we know the Manhattan know something
00:25:29.039 about the Manhattan Project but like
00:25:30.760 where exactly did that you know came
00:25:32.000 from Germany German scientists were
00:25:33.360 working on
00:25:35.120 okay um the one p a separate
00:25:37.799 conversation but the one person I know
00:25:39.000 who's really pushed on I was writing a
00:25:40.120 book on it um who's a trustworthy person
00:25:42.919 and a friend of mine I know you know him
00:25:45.520 um said to me actually I spent a year
00:25:48.000 working on this and I One the closer I
00:25:49.799 got to like okay but what's the Genesis
00:25:51.559 like where the where did this what was
00:25:53.000 the mo what was the Isaac Newton Apple
00:25:54.760 on the head o gravity's real moment for
00:25:57.360 fision
00:25:59.159 not clear weird I don't know the answer
00:26:01.960 but but here's the point clearly
00:26:03.440 government has technology that we don't
00:26:04.840 we're not read in on right of course
00:26:08.159 but so that doesn't answer the question
00:26:11.840 why have people seen these objects in
00:26:15.000 the skies for thousands of years
00:26:18.000 confirmed and what are they and maybe
00:26:21.360 they're from another planet and my only
00:26:22.640 point is there's no evidence of that
00:26:24.200 there's a huge amount a massive Corpus
00:26:26.600 of evidence that they're seen by people
00:26:29.320 in our atmosphere you know on Earth
00:26:31.799 looking up or in a submarine looking out
00:26:35.000 and what is that and by the way to your
00:26:39.840 point like we can't see them coming into
00:26:41.720 our atmosphere because they don't want
00:26:42.720 to be seen well then why do they want to
00:26:44.120 be seen by people on earth like if they
00:26:47.200 if the technolog is that advanced and
00:26:48.720 clearly it is why do they make
00:26:50.880 themselves visible in the first place
00:26:53.120 well you know when we study primates uh
00:26:56.480 one of the things that we do if do you
00:26:58.080 ever watch chimp Nation on N don't have
00:27:01.159 a TV but the sound of it uh it's an
00:27:04.919 amazing documentary on Netflix that
00:27:07.399 details these embedded scientists uh in
00:27:10.399 the Congo and what's really fascinating
00:27:12.600 about it is that this group of
00:27:15.159 scientists or you know related
00:27:17.520 scientists have been there for 20 plus
00:27:19.679 years so these chimps have become
00:27:23.720 entirely accustomed to having human
00:27:26.600 beings near them so this very specific
00:27:28.720 rules you stay within 20 yards of them
00:27:31.360 you if they come closer you back up you
00:27:34.039 never have food ever you can't bring any
00:27:36.320 food there cuz they they'll [ __ ] you up
00:27:38.039 and just steal your food if they find
00:27:39.399 out you have food you're in real trouble
00:27:41.679 oh yeah they tear you apart and they
00:27:43.880 kill each other so they they'll
00:27:45.039 definitely kill you and so when they
00:27:48.679 have done this the chimps have become
00:27:51.120 accustomed to them being there and The
00:27:52.960 Chimps behave completely normally The
00:27:55.120 Chimps see them as just an innocuous
00:27:58.200 part of their environment they're not
00:28:00.039 food and they're not enemy they don't
00:28:02.039 ever intrude they don't try to challenge
00:28:04.600 them they don't make eye contact so they
00:28:06.000 don't worry about the people at all so
00:28:07.679 they behave completely like
00:28:09.720 chimps and if I was an advanced species
00:28:13.880 and I was studying people and I wanted
00:28:16.440 the human beings to eventually kind of
00:28:20.240 catch up right like you're introducing
00:28:23.519 technology that they call donations
00:28:26.080 crash Vehicles figure figure out what
00:28:28.519 fiber optics are here you go check this
00:28:30.880 out figure this out try to figure that
00:28:33.039 out maybe it'll take you decades maybe
00:28:34.640 it'll take you more but you are
00:28:38.200 accelerating the technological evolution
00:28:40.840 of this Advanced species on this planet
00:28:43.080 and one way to do that would be for what
00:28:45.120 purpose I wonder well that's a very good
00:28:49.200 question my my belief is
00:28:53.320 that biological intelligent life is a
00:28:58.159 essentially a caterpillar and it's a
00:29:00.799 caterpillar that's making a cocoon and
00:29:03.159 it doesn't even know why it's doing it
00:29:04.720 it's just doing it and that cocoon is
00:29:07.360 going to give birth to artificial life
00:29:09.720 Digital Life it's going to give birth to
00:29:11.919 a new life form and I think we're real
00:29:13.919 close to that I think we're way closer
00:29:16.960 than that to that than most people would
00:29:19.039 ever want to Adit agree I agree and I
00:29:21.039 think but can we assign a like a value
00:29:23.440 to that is that good or
00:29:24.799 bad that's a good question it depends
00:29:29.559 universally I think it's the path I
00:29:32.159 think it's what happens I
00:29:35.080 think what this thing is if if you
00:29:38.600 extrapolate if you take the concept of a
00:29:42.360 a sentient artificial intelligence that
00:29:46.000 has the ability to utilize all the
00:29:49.399 information that every human being has
00:29:52.200 on Earth at a level of computing that's
00:29:55.440 far beyond the capabilities of the human
00:29:57.480 mind and all of our supercomputers that
00:30:00.159 currently exist because it'll design
00:30:01.880 much better computers it'll use quantum
00:30:04.200 computers it'll have the ability to
00:30:07.080 recode things and change things it'll
00:30:09.279 make better versions of itself so
00:30:12.320 instead of biological evolution which is
00:30:15.720 very slow it takes a long time
00:30:17.760 relatively it takes it's pretty quick
00:30:20.000 really when you think about it like how
00:30:21.440 long it's not that long to go from being
00:30:23.880 a single cell organism to being a human
00:30:25.799 being flying a plane really atively over
00:30:29.080 the course of a billion years if you
00:30:30.559 think about how long the universe has
00:30:31.799 been around but it's slow compared to
00:30:35.399 technological Evolution I mean a hundred
00:30:38.120 years ago we didn't have [ __ ] and now we
00:30:40.559 have we could send videos from your
00:30:43.039 phone and it'll hit New Zealand in a
00:30:46.080 second it's crazy the stuff that we have
00:30:48.720 now is beyond imagination it's
00:30:51.440 essentially magic for people a 100 years
00:30:55.120 ago if that keeps going
00:30:58.559 it's ultimately going to leave to a life
00:31:00.120 form and if that life form has now
00:31:03.880 untethered it has doesn't have any
00:31:06.000 problems with biological evolution now
00:31:08.399 it's just about information and
00:31:10.120 implementing the technology that's
00:31:12.120 available and then increasing that
00:31:13.480 technology and making it better and
00:31:14.840 better it essentially becomes a
00:31:17.600 God because if if you give it enough
00:31:20.559 time it it it doesn't it has the ability
00:31:24.080 to make better versions of itself which
00:31:25.919 will in turn make better versions of
00:31:27.679 itself self it has the ability to
00:31:30.799 utilize everything it has the the
00:31:34.519 understanding of everything that exists
00:31:37.799 in the universe ex black holes Dark
00:31:40.760 Matter everything and it probably has
00:31:43.600 the ability to harness that or even
00:31:45.519 reproduce
00:31:47.000 that so if you take artificial sentient
00:31:50.000 in intelligence and it has this super
00:31:53.000 accelerated path of technological
00:31:55.720 Evolution and you give Art
00:31:58.760 general intelligence sensient artificial
00:32:01.600 intelligence far beyond human beings you
00:32:03.880 give it a thousand years alone to to
00:32:07.240 make better and better versions of
00:32:08.639 itself where does that go that goes to a
00:32:11.159 god it it literally create un kind of
00:32:14.279 God so like I I think of it this way so
00:32:16.039 the first stage of the Industrial
00:32:18.200 Revolution consisted of people building
00:32:20.760 machines that were stronger than the
00:32:22.360 human body right right so the steam
00:32:25.039 powered Loom sure the backo com
00:32:28.480 combustion engine they replace they
00:32:30.639 replace muscles right right so that's
00:32:32.760 what the machine does it it becomes
00:32:34.760 stronger than the human body the second
00:32:36.440 stage which we're in the middle of
00:32:38.720 consists of creating machines that are
00:32:40.279 more powerful than the human
00:32:42.039 mind that's what Computing is and I
00:32:44.919 would say AI or super competing it's
00:32:46.639 just
00:32:48.360 that exponentially
00:32:51.240 uh but that doesn't make it a God in the
00:32:54.919 sense that the machine however powerful
00:32:57.639 it is any more than a backhoe is a God
00:33:00.360 because it can dig a trench faster than
00:33:02.080 100 men it it's still something that
00:33:04.840 people created so the story hasn't
00:33:07.919 really changed at the center of the
00:33:09.240 story are
00:33:10.480 people and their creative power may lead
00:33:13.480 to unintended consequences but the
00:33:15.600 machines that they build did not make
00:33:17.919 the universe and did not make people
00:33:20.159 people made the machines right so if and
00:33:22.519 I but I would say the part I agree with
00:33:24.519 is there's a spiritual component here
00:33:26.080 for
00:33:26.760 sure people will worship AI as a god AI
00:33:30.960 Ted kazinski was likely right will get
00:33:33.120 away from us we will be controlled by
00:33:35.200 the thing that we made all those are bad
00:33:37.679 like that's just bad and we need to say
00:33:39.159 unequivocally it's bad it's bad to be
00:33:40.919 controlled by machines right machines
00:33:43.799 are helpmates like they we created them
00:33:46.279 to help us to make our lives better not
00:33:48.679 to take orders from them um so I I don't
00:33:52.960 know why we're not having any of these
00:33:54.080 conversations right now we're just
00:33:55.559 acting as if this is like some kind of
00:33:58.679 virus like Co that spreads across the
00:34:00.880 world inexorably there's nothing we can
00:34:02.279 do about it just wait to get it it's
00:34:04.279 like no if we agree that the outcome is
00:34:07.760 bad which and specifically it's bad for
00:34:10.719 people we should care what's good for
00:34:12.879 people that's all we should care about
00:34:14.119 is it good for people or not if it's bad
00:34:16.440 for people then we should strangle it in
00:34:18.399 its crib right now right and why to blow
00:34:21.719 up the data centers like I don't why is
00:34:23.359 that hard if it's actually going to
00:34:25.159 become what you just
00:34:26.520 described which which is a threat to
00:34:28.560 people
00:34:29.800 Humanity life then we have a a moral
00:34:33.399 obligation to murder it immediately and
00:34:35.320 since it's not alive we don't need to
00:34:36.560 feel bad about that well you could say
00:34:38.760 the same about the atomic bomb right yes
00:34:40.639 you could and you could say that we have
00:34:43.199 to develop it like Oppenheimer felt
00:34:45.639 before the Nazis did I love that how'd
00:34:48.399 that
00:34:50.079 work how'd that work well I love by the
00:34:53.719 way that people on my side I'll just say
00:34:56.599 I'll just admit it on the right you know
00:34:59.640 have spent the last 80 years defending
00:35:01.520 dropping nuclear weapons on civilians
00:35:04.440 like are you joking right that's just
00:35:06.680 like Prima fascia evil if you can't well
00:35:10.040 if we hadn't done that then this that
00:35:11.560 the other thing that was actually a
00:35:12.720 great Savings of life no it's wrong to
00:35:14.320 drop nuclear weapons on people and if
00:35:16.560 you find yourself arguing that it's a
00:35:18.119 good thing to drop nuclear weapons on
00:35:19.560 people then you are evil like it's it's
00:35:21.400 not a it's not a tough one right it's
00:35:22.920 not a hard call for it's not a hard call
00:35:24.440 for me so with that in mind like why
00:35:27.839 would you want nuclear weapons it's like
00:35:29.640 just a Mindless childish sort of
00:35:32.000 intellectual exercise to justify like oh
00:35:34.359 no it's really good because someone else
00:35:35.680 get how about no how about like spending
00:35:37.680 all of your effort to prevent this from
00:35:39.800 happening would you kill Baby Hitler you
00:35:42.240 know famously
00:35:44.240 right um so I don't know why we're
00:35:46.520 sitting back and allowing this to happen
00:35:48.280 if we really believe it will extinguish
00:35:50.359 the human race or enslave the human race
00:35:53.760 like how can that be good well if God
00:35:56.960 creates everything if God created the
00:35:58.800 universe and God creates people God
00:36:00.920 probably creates a process and we think
00:36:04.839 that we are very important because we
00:36:07.240 are very important to us but are are we
00:36:10.839 very important in a universal sense not
00:36:13.599 really like if the Earth just imploded
00:36:16.480 and disappeared if the sun went
00:36:18.200 supernova and our whole solar system was
00:36:20.560 blown to bits the universe is still
00:36:23.720 exists it depends how wi for sure in in
00:36:26.800 our the end as Conan O'Brien the famous
00:36:30.119 philosopher once said every grave goes
00:36:31.920 unvisited which is true and that's an
00:36:33.839 important perspective pull out the lens
00:36:35.560 a little bit does it really matter no it
00:36:37.200 doesn't but it does matter do your kids
00:36:40.200 how about this do your children matter
00:36:41.880 yes sure do their lives matter would you
00:36:44.160 die for them yes of course everything
00:36:46.599 matters if you're not comfortable it
00:36:48.079 matters if you're sitting here like you
00:36:49.400 don't want to wear headphones like let's
00:36:50.560 not wear headphones that matters
00:36:52.880 everything matters the the I mean at
00:36:55.680 scale what matters most like right is it
00:36:58.359 that is the evil right the evil is the
00:37:00.160 it's the same thing is saying the
00:37:01.200 necessary evil of dropping nuclear bombs
00:37:03.319 on civilians is if you don't do that
00:37:05.680 then there will be more evil then more
00:37:07.520 things will happen it's kind of the same
00:37:09.319 thing like it doesn't it well it comes
00:37:11.160 from the same place which is hubris like
00:37:12.960 imagining you're God you have unlimited
00:37:15.760 power and you have omniscience you can
00:37:18.160 imagine what the future's going to be
00:37:20.000 you can't you're [ __ ] idiot you're a
00:37:22.319 person like you can't even make your
00:37:23.720 wife happy like the limits of your power
00:37:26.319 are really obvious the limits of your
00:37:28.160 wisdom same so like don't jump into [ __ ]
00:37:33.040 big things whose outcomes you can't
00:37:35.480 predict with certainty like you can't
00:37:37.000 know go in with humility I guess that's
00:37:38.680 what I'm saying right so yeah um and do
00:37:42.880 what you can knowing that you're
00:37:44.319 probably going to screw it up and you
00:37:46.560 probably won't achieve your goal but
00:37:48.160 like you should try and on the AI
00:37:50.280 question everyone I've ever talked to
00:37:52.160 but I'm hardly an expert I don't own a
00:37:54.000 computer okay but um Everybody I've ever
00:37:57.520 talked to and there's many people like
00:37:59.079 yeah it's you know could get away from
00:38:00.359 us and enslave us well let's say no to
00:38:03.200 slavery how's that is that a tough one
00:38:04.839 not for me yeah I mean and maybe a good
00:38:08.119 use of nuclear weapons would be to hit
00:38:10.119 the data
00:38:11.160 centers no I'm I'm Ser like why is that
00:38:13.800 crazy it's not it's not if you think
00:38:17.480 that human beings are the end of this
00:38:20.599 evolutionary CH well what else is some
00:38:23.000 supercomputer in a data center outside
00:38:24.920 Dallas airport no I mean you know what I
00:38:27.079 mean like I don't actually think that
00:38:30.040 individuals I don't think I'm that
00:38:31.920 important my life is that important I
00:38:33.319 don't I will die I know that and I try
00:38:34.960 to keep that in mind every day but
00:38:36.280 you're important to everybody that you
00:38:38.040 that cares about you you're important to
00:38:39.560 the people around if we don't think if
00:38:40.839 we don't think people are important then
00:38:42.920 what do we think is important I guess
00:38:44.480 that's what I'm saying it's not
00:38:45.400 necessarily that we don't think people
00:38:46.720 are important but if if if evolution is
00:38:49.079 real and if there is this constant I
00:38:52.040 don't know but it's it's it's visible
00:38:55.400 like you can measure it in certain
00:38:57.160 animals
00:38:58.000 you can measure adaptation yeah but
00:38:59.920 there's no evidence that EV in fact I
00:39:01.640 think we've kind of given up on the idea
00:39:02.920 Evolution the theory of evolution is
00:39:04.599 articulated by Darwin is like kind of
00:39:06.280 not true in what in what
00:39:08.480 sense well in the most basic sense the
00:39:11.079 idea that you know all life emerge from
00:39:13.720 a single cell organism and over time and
00:39:17.119 there would be a fossil record of that
00:39:18.319 and there's not and there's not a fossil
00:39:20.440 record of uh transitionary species like
00:39:23.640 species that are adapting to its
00:39:25.400 environment of record of a and you see
00:39:28.319 it in your own life I mean I have a lot
00:39:30.560 of dogs I I see adaptation in dogs you
00:39:32.760 know through the sure um litter to
00:39:35.960 litter but no there's no evidence at all
00:39:40.040 that none zero that you know people you
00:39:44.040 know evolve seamlessly from a single
00:39:46.200 cell amoeba no there's not there's not
00:39:48.480 there's no chain in the fossil record of
00:39:50.160 that at all and that's why you don't
00:39:52.200 actually hear people you hear them make
00:39:53.920 reference to Evolution because the
00:39:55.760 theory of adaptation is clearly
00:39:57.440 obviously
00:39:58.440 true but Darwin's theory is totally un
00:40:02.079 that's why it's still a theory almost
00:40:03.680 200 years later you know um no we have
00:40:06.560 not found that at all and I can't even
00:40:09.400 guess I mean I have my own theories on
00:40:10.839 it but they're not proven what are your
00:40:12.560 theories God created people you know
00:40:15.240 distinctly and animals I mean I think
00:40:17.760 that's like I think what every person on
00:40:20.440 Earth thought until the mid 19th century
00:40:23.200 actually right but it's not a new idea
00:40:25.800 they they didn't have computer they
00:40:27.800 didn't have a a general understanding
00:40:29.520 that we have today of the process do you
00:40:31.960 think we understand more now yes really
00:40:34.800 you don't think that we understand more
00:40:35.839 today we understand way less we
00:40:37.359 understand so little that we're actually
00:40:39.760 sitting here allowing like a bunch of
00:40:43.560 greedy stupid childless childless
00:40:47.760 software engineers in Northern
00:40:49.319 California to like flirt with the
00:40:51.000 extinction of mankind so no pre previous
00:40:54.599 generations would be like what no stop
00:40:58.720 and um we're not doing that because but
00:41:01.160 they wouldn't have done that even with
00:41:02.160 the nuclear bomb I mean obviously the
00:41:04.560 Manhattan Project was done in secrecy
00:41:06.359 but they wouldn't have stopped it
00:41:08.040 because the imperative of getting this
00:41:10.160 weapon before Hitler got the weapon was
00:41:13.000 what well Hitler was kind of done by
00:41:14.800 then um the Russians had pretty much
00:41:16.880 extinguished any hope that that would
00:41:18.680 continue but but not the you know we
00:41:21.720 were in the middle of the logic of war
00:41:23.680 the commencement of the Manhattan
00:41:24.880 Project for sure and but the logic was
00:41:26.760 the same it was you know four years of
00:41:28.680 got to beat the other guy got it and I
00:41:31.000 don't I don't mean to sound too
00:41:32.280 judgmental about the bomb I know why
00:41:33.640 they built it okay but you just wonder
00:41:36.520 why nobody in the middle of that thought
00:41:39.280 is this really a and some of them did
00:41:40.680 think it I'm sure they did I mean
00:41:42.359 Oppenheimer himself of course large
00:41:44.680 organizations don't respond to the moral
00:41:47.160 qualms of individuals very well uh so
00:41:50.000 that was whatever it's it's well known
00:41:52.319 what happened but no we should pause and
00:41:55.200 ask is the machine we're building worth
00:41:58.400 having and nobody seems to do that and
00:42:01.319 there are all kinds of economic forces
00:42:02.800 which nobody ever mentions that drive
00:42:06.000 that heedlessness that stupidity like
00:42:08.920 California for example um is completely
00:42:11.880 the state both of us have lived in is
00:42:14.319 like like collapsing and they're betting
00:42:16.920 everything on AI for the the tax base is
00:42:19.480 going to be dependent on this technology
00:42:22.040 working and is what they're betting on
00:42:23.839 of course that AI is did you see the the
00:42:27.240 most recent thing about the amount of
00:42:29.040 billions of dollars they spent on the
00:42:30.240 homeless problem with no trackable
00:42:32.040 results well they've had massive results
00:42:33.880 they've increased the homeless
00:42:34.920 population dramatically if you pay for
00:42:36.800 something you get more of it and that
00:42:38.680 would include fentanyl addicts oh
00:42:40.319 absolutely it's been a wild success I
00:42:42.839 actually talked to Kevin Newsome the
00:42:44.480 other day did you really yeah and um
00:42:48.000 what's that like does he smell like
00:42:49.319 sulfur it was by phone I was talking him
00:42:51.599 on the phone such a weird um he smell
00:42:55.000 like that was too fast for me sulfur and
00:42:57.920 hair grease
00:42:59.839 yeah no but I was making I was making
00:43:02.640 fun of I shouldn't even make fun of it
00:43:04.400 cuz it's so tragic but what's happened
00:43:05.760 to the state and people living on the
00:43:07.079 street and what is his non- gasy
00:43:11.160 perspective he's said go back to Russia
00:43:13.440 you like Russia so much I was like you
00:43:15.200 know actually I'm originally from San
00:43:17.319 Francisco but um I can't live there
00:43:19.440 because he really told you to go back to
00:43:21.520 Russ of course I mean he was laughing
00:43:23.520 whatever um he's a perfectly Charming
00:43:25.640 guy they all are in person of course
00:43:27.720 anyway my I'm so far a field but my
00:43:30.480 point is AI is being driven by the greed
00:43:33.960 of politicians to some extent um and
00:43:36.920 you'll notice that AI by the way as a
00:43:39.440 fact those data centers that drive our
00:43:41.839 Digital Life which is not life it's
00:43:43.400 actually death mostly but um I mean
00:43:46.440 they're the biggest power draw I mean
00:43:49.800 what will how much electricity does AI
00:43:53.200 require like more than countries M our
00:43:56.040 grid can't handle AI just as a practical
00:43:58.160 matter well our grid can't handle
00:43:59.720 electric cars Well it can't handle air
00:44:02.000 conditioning in the state of California
00:44:03.319 where I'm from so right if you live east
00:44:05.839 of I5 where it's really hot and you're
00:44:07.960 not getting those ocean breezes like
00:44:09.680 your they have brown outs like in South
00:44:11.640 Africa it's Johannesburg now so but
00:44:14.319 here's what's interesting is that none
00:44:16.119 of the global warming cultists seem to
00:44:19.400 have any concerns at all about AI why is
00:44:21.680 that just like they don't have concerns
00:44:23.440 about John K's G4 like somehow that's
00:44:26.119 exempt really AI is going to draw more
00:44:29.240 electricity than anything else in the
00:44:31.200 United States more than steel production
00:44:33.520 okay used to and you don't have a
00:44:36.240 problem with that but you're totally
00:44:37.800 against energy because it's destroying
00:44:39.599 the planet but AI gets a carve out even
00:44:41.680 though it's going to be the number one
00:44:42.760 energy draw in the United States let's
00:44:45.400 go through your reasoning on that
00:44:47.240 they're probably not aware well they're
00:44:48.680 tot they're not aware they're mad about
00:44:50.839 my wood stove I heat with wood they're
00:44:52.920 mad about my wood stove they don't want
00:44:54.559 an outdoor barbecue they don't like a
00:44:57.280 gas stove no they're way into the
00:44:59.319 details on this stuff except somehow AI
00:45:03.119 isn't a problem but do you think that
00:45:04.920 they're informed because this is not a
00:45:06.359 narrative that you ever hear you never
00:45:09.040 hear uh on the news I grew up in a world
00:45:11.440 where a wood stove was considered
00:45:12.800 holesome and natural and now it's
00:45:14.480 considered oh it's the best and the heat
00:45:16.720 is the I I have a Woodfired sauna which
00:45:19.000 I use every day and it's the great you
00:45:21.599 know it's one how do you make sure it's
00:45:22.640 the right temperature is it like U like
00:45:24.599 an Offset Smoker like you have to kind
00:45:26.200 of fiddle with it amazing to get the
00:45:28.319 right it's time consuming now I have a
00:45:30.960 finish um the fins are geniuses but I
00:45:33.440 have a Finnish uh stove in it and it's
00:45:36.960 incredibly prec I don't know if you ever
00:45:38.359 use a wood stove but there's a
00:45:39.359 carburetor on it basically that lets in
00:45:41.079 air like a like an Offset Smoker yeah
00:45:44.040 exactly and it's so precise I mean it's
00:45:47.040 it's absolutely crazy I mean you move it
00:45:49.200 you know a third of an inch and it just
00:45:51.240 like the flame changes so I use Birch
00:45:53.440 which I love and um the whole process
00:45:56.280 takes a while get it to 200 which
00:45:58.200 probably takes an hour and 20 I mean
00:46:01.520 it's it's a Thing You Like It Hot Like
00:46:03.359 It Hot yeah yeah 200 yeah I do it every
00:46:06.119 I wear a sauna hat so oh okay does that
00:46:08.280 help which is embarrassing the wool hat
00:46:10.680 yeah well it's it's felt yeah I bought
00:46:12.520 one of those I never wore it it's
00:46:13.760 incredible yeah what's the difference
00:46:16.079 I'll tell you you're cuz you're duny I'm
00:46:18.760 so boring on this subject I going at
00:46:21.119 this like my wife and kids are like you
00:46:24.119 see I have one you know we're you're
00:46:25.640 speaking to the car the best
00:46:27.720 go Scandinavia um it's like the one
00:46:30.440 thing if your name is Carlson uh it's
00:46:33.040 the one thing to be proud of and your
00:46:34.640 people like they're so sad and defeated
00:46:36.440 and pathetic but um saunas are still
00:46:38.960 great but anyway uh the sauna hat so
00:46:42.599 your head heats up much faster because
00:46:44.119 it's higher but also because it's got
00:46:45.640 all the capillaries in your head all
00:46:47.920 blood vessels in your head so the point
00:46:50.520 of a of a sauna is to bake right so you
00:46:53.800 want to stay hot as long as you can then
00:46:55.839 you reap the benefits and you also get
00:46:57.359 the Solitude and the prayer time or the
00:46:58.880 meditation or whatever in your Cedar
00:47:01.240 church and but you can't stay in a sauna
00:47:04.000 that's really hot very long because your
00:47:06.920 head heats up right so the Sonic hat the
00:47:09.760 felt hat the B hat as they call it
00:47:12.400 insulates your head so you can you can
00:47:14.319 really stay hot a long long
00:47:17.440 time um it makes a you really should do
00:47:20.319 it so is it just because it makes it
00:47:22.160 more comfortable is that the idea if
00:47:24.280 your head overheats you know it just
00:47:26.200 overheats and you want is you want to
00:47:28.000 cook evenly just like on a barbecue you
00:47:30.119 know you really do and so you know you
00:47:33.119 sit on the bench with your feet up you
00:47:35.520 want to be as flat as you possibly can
00:47:37.319 to cook evenly and to stay that way so I
00:47:40.160 do I try to do 20 minutes I have my you
00:47:43.359 know my timer U my egg timer with the
00:47:46.200 sand going through The Hourglass and I
00:47:48.240 which goes to 15 minutes but I try to
00:47:49.839 stay an extra five if I can and um and I
00:47:53.200 couldn't without the B hat interesting
00:47:55.640 it's like eight bucks on Amazon
00:47:57.359 well worth it yeah I I have one like I
00:47:59.880 said I just don't use it but I I do
00:48:02.280 they're embarrassing and you look like a
00:48:03.800 tool wearing it yeah but you shouldn't
00:48:06.119 have but no one's looking in there
00:48:07.280 anyway well that's right you don't s
00:48:08.680 with other people right well I do
00:48:10.319 sometimes yeah Comics we get in here
00:48:12.760 yeah yeah yeah when we uh train together
00:48:15.079 we all get in the saong together
00:48:16.960 afterwards it's fun The Rock was in
00:48:19.559 there with us no way yeah the rock
00:48:21.520 worked out with us then sat in the sauna
00:48:23.160 with us it was fun got in the Cal plunge
00:48:25.680 with us oh that's pretty great it was
00:48:27.160 fun is he a good dude he's a great guy
00:48:29.760 really nice guy like really I've heard
00:48:31.960 that I don't know him but I've heard
00:48:33.200 that he's a good you know some people
00:48:34.920 fake humble they fake it to look cool
00:48:37.520 it's pretty obvious yeah he's not doing
00:48:39.079 that he's he's a real guy like the
00:48:40.599 measure of humility is really really
00:48:42.359 simple can you tell the truth about
00:48:44.400 yourself yeah you know yeah well you
00:48:47.440 know are you just are you cool to be
00:48:49.160 around like he he gives real hugs you
00:48:51.520 know he's a real guy I love he's real
00:48:53.319 he's a real guy and we when we hung out
00:48:55.440 with him we were I hung out with them
00:48:56.960 for hours we worked out for like 2 hours
00:48:59.160 and then we got in the sauner together
00:49:00.880 we all hung out then we did a podcast
00:49:02.240 together he's a genuinely nice guy like
00:49:04.839 You' you'd be able to sniff something
00:49:07.040 out you can tell like something you tell
00:49:10.280 something you know people are hiding
00:49:12.079 stuff yeah but um so yeah I do I've done
00:49:15.040 the SAA with other people I do it by
00:49:16.760 myself so no one sees my SAA I do it at
00:49:18.599 196 degrees I do it for 25 minutes and
00:49:22.200 uh us I don't that's intense 196 for 25
00:49:25.760 minutes is a lot yeah the last five
00:49:27.520 minutes are rough and I used to only do
00:49:29.000 20 but lately I've been doing 25 really
00:49:32.280 yeah just because it's more
00:49:33.799 uncomfortable the whole idea is just to
00:49:36.200 to make it more uncomfortable I want it
00:49:38.119 to be very hard to do so that the rest
00:49:41.000 of my day is pretty easy so really hard
00:49:43.400 workout cold plunge starts the day
00:49:45.599 that's the the the first thing I do is
00:49:47.480 hard it's 3 minutes at 33 degrees it
00:49:50.400 sucks and then I get out of there and
00:49:52.440 then I work out so um it's really
00:49:54.839 impressive I me night
00:49:57.400 I had the opposite training as a young
00:49:59.040 man which was the goal was like french
00:50:02.040 toast you know what I mean French toast
00:50:05.280 grind out the cigarettes in the syrup
00:50:06.960 when you're done yeah well I I started
00:50:09.319 doing martial arts when I was a young
00:50:11.480 man and when I got into it it was the
00:50:13.760 first thing that I had ever did that
00:50:15.520 first of all gave me a real
00:50:17.400 understanding of the value of discipline
00:50:18.760 and hard work yeah because uh you can
00:50:21.559 get as good as the amount of effort that
00:50:23.799 you put forth and if you put more effort
00:50:25.960 and you're more tense and you're more
00:50:27.440 driven than other people you beat them
00:50:29.720 and you start beating everyone and you
00:50:31.599 start you start becoming this thing that
00:50:34.280 you never thought you could be which is
00:50:36.160 someone who's extraordinary at something
00:50:38.240 that's very dangerous and so that was my
00:50:41.160 formulation as a man like that that
00:50:43.720 helped me go from being this like
00:50:46.640 confused kid to being someone who
00:50:50.040 understands like oh there's a path and
00:50:52.520 most people don't want to do it but if
00:50:54.280 you could do it if you can do this
00:50:56.799 dangerous thing that people are
00:50:58.160 terrified of and just do it ruthlessly
00:51:01.079 all day long like live it I lived at the
00:51:04.240 gym I mean I taught all day long I I
00:51:07.200 trained all day long my my whole life
00:51:09.599 was dedicated to martial arts so I got
00:51:12.319 really good really quick and it it
00:51:15.960 changed the whole trajectory of my life
00:51:18.960 and it instilled in me this
00:51:21.280 understanding of the value of dedication
00:51:25.240 and of a singular commitment to
00:51:27.280 something to really being while you're
00:51:29.520 doing you're not distracted you're fully
00:51:31.599 focused on
00:51:32.839 improving and through that you could
00:51:35.400 apply that to all aspects of your life
00:51:38.000 but we all encounter difficult things in
00:51:40.280 life and there's this saying that I love
00:51:42.839 it's a really great saying that the the
00:51:44.720 hardest thing that's ever happened to
00:51:45.960 you is the hardest thing that's ever
00:51:47.119 happened to you if it's a parking ticket
00:51:49.000 or if it's your parents being blown up
00:51:50.319 by a drone it's still the hardest thing
00:51:52.079 that's ever happened to you if you've
00:51:53.400 had an incredibly easy life like most
00:51:55.359 people today yeah they complain about
00:51:57.559 the dumbest [ __ ] [ __ ] because to them
00:52:00.760 that is their primary focus they don't
00:52:03.040 have a real existential threat you
00:52:05.319 remember how nice everybody was after
00:52:06.839 911 very it was crazy California was
00:52:10.040 patriotic there's [ __ ] flags on
00:52:11.960 everybody's car everybody was friendly I
00:52:14.160 went to New York City it was like a
00:52:15.400 totally different place everybody was so
00:52:17.000 friendly applauding when firemen walked
00:52:18.839 in they were Heroes everybody was a hero
00:52:22.160 and that's because they had encountered
00:52:25.040 something that was way harder than they
00:52:26.359 were were accustomed to and it just put
00:52:28.079 things into perspective so for me
00:52:31.040 training and really hard workouts and
00:52:33.200 doing difficult things like the sauna
00:52:35.319 there's a lot of health benefits to it
00:52:36.880 too but the mental benefits to it are
00:52:39.880 really primary for me because it makes
00:52:42.680 it's impressive I didn't have a
00:52:44.440 childhood like that at all and we were
00:52:46.559 decadent
00:52:48.160 unfortunately and uh so those are
00:52:50.040 lessons that I learned much much later
00:52:52.559 but yeah it's that's a that's a good I
00:52:55.160 think it's a if it doesn't destroy you I
00:52:57.359 think it's a great way to you don't have
00:52:58.400 to do it the way I do it you could do
00:53:00.000 other stuff you could do yoga you could
00:53:01.680 do hikes you could do doing things for
00:53:04.119 the sake of the difficulty in doing them
00:53:07.040 yes I I love that again that was not not
00:53:10.599 not my training at all yeah um I was
00:53:13.799 very lucky that it was mine but more
00:53:15.760 importantly it gave me a tool to
00:53:17.960 mitigate the stress of regular life and
00:53:21.040 this especially the stress of this kind
00:53:22.680 of life that I live you you need
00:53:24.839 something to mitigate that you agree
00:53:27.880 with that completely you'll go crazy
00:53:30.319 yeah you know removing yourself from it
00:53:32.119 a little bit has always worked for me
00:53:35.400 you know nature Works a very very well
00:53:38.720 yeah animals contact with animals people
00:53:41.000 you love sure less digital experiences
00:53:45.319 fewer digital experiences for
00:53:47.599 sure I think that stuff's not good for
00:53:50.400 you it's just so obviously not good for
00:53:52.359 you I was having this conversation with
00:53:53.960 Michelle Dow yesterday she is uh a woman
00:53:57.119 who survived an apocalyptic cult she was
00:54:00.280 raised in apocalyptic cult and kicked
00:54:02.720 out when she was 17 cuz she snuck out to
00:54:05.359 go see the color purple they weren't
00:54:07.079 allowed to go see movies she had never
00:54:08.240 seen a movie until she was 17 she'd
00:54:10.240 never seen a movie and her first movie
00:54:11.559 was the color purple and then they
00:54:13.119 kicked her out they I can kind of see
00:54:15.040 that I mean what about Raiders of the
00:54:16.480 Lost Arc or something The Color Purple
00:54:18.680 was the first movie she'd ever seen I
00:54:20.160 know but like you see one movie and it's
00:54:22.640 the color purple a boy invited her to
00:54:24.799 the movie but could you imagine never
00:54:27.720 seeing a movie or even a television your
00:54:29.760 whole life and then seeing a boy who
00:54:31.400 wanted to see the color purple like
00:54:33.000 there's so much going on here Joe well
00:54:36.119 this boy was a guy who had left the
00:54:38.440 church and so she was in contact with
00:54:40.680 him and you know and he was saying hey
00:54:42.839 there's a whole world out here you want
00:54:44.200 to go see the movie and she's like okay
00:54:46.520 let's go yeah I mean obvious look I'm
00:54:48.559 totally against Colts um obviously on
00:54:52.160 the other hand you do you got to ask
00:54:54.680 yourself like I don't know is your
00:54:57.520 average Amish teenager
00:55:00.520 happier than your average conventional
00:55:03.920 American Teenager on Instagram and of
00:55:05.960 course the answer is oh yeah well they
00:55:07.760 certainly have less instances of autism
00:55:10.079 which is really fascinating it's very
00:55:12.599 very fish have less autism yeah there's
00:55:15.079 almost none well I'm not surprised it's
00:55:17.520 extremely rare what do we think that is
00:55:19.760 I wonder I really did I can think of a
00:55:22.559 couple yeah that's funny I don't want to
00:55:24.319 go Bobby Kennedy that's the problem if
00:55:26.599 you go Bobby Kennedy they'll come for
00:55:28.000 you the question is why why look and I
00:55:30.680 don't I don't know the answer but how is
00:55:33.400 that not in the de debate how is that
00:55:35.520 not in the conversation well it's not
00:55:36.760 only not in the conversation you're
00:55:37.839 punished for adding it to the
00:55:39.079 conversation and so like we are dancing
00:55:41.920 around antivaxx conspiracy theories
00:55:44.039 right now why why be on the defensive
00:55:46.200 it's like if you purport to represent
00:55:48.520 science and you're mad about a question
00:55:50.559 and you're ignoring data yeah but even
00:55:53.200 with in the absence of data right
00:55:55.520 science is the is a process yes it's not
00:55:58.839 a result it's a way of doing things and
00:56:01.640 at the core of science is asking
00:56:04.480 questions including unlikely questions
00:56:06.440 right that that's what science is right
00:56:08.640 and if you don't allow that then you
00:56:10.599 know you're you may be doing something
00:56:12.520 but what you're not doing is science we
00:56:14.039 we can we can say that conclusively so
00:56:16.200 for people to wrap themselves in the
00:56:17.920 mantle of Science and attack you for
00:56:19.760 asking a
00:56:20.760 question um you know they're frauds and
00:56:24.119 I don't know how they have the moral
00:56:25.440 High Ground in this I don't think they
00:56:27.000 do but I think it's the same kind of
00:56:29.280 mindset that allows people to create the
00:56:31.599 nuclear bomb because you say listen like
00:56:35.240 like let's we're not even saying that
00:56:37.000 vaccines cause autism but let's let's
00:56:40.760 say this if you're looking at all the
00:56:44.079 data of all the things that cause autism
00:56:46.599 and you see that the vaccine schedule
00:56:49.720 ramps up considerably and then you
00:56:53.160 have autism which seems to at least be
00:56:56.640 more diagnosed than ever before people
00:56:59.640 will instantly say we stopped polio we
00:57:03.680 stopped small poox vaccines have saved
00:57:06.280 millions of lives and they're probably
00:57:08.359 right we Dro that bomb to keep Germany
00:57:11.480 from dropping that bomb we need nuclear
00:57:14.280 weapons so that other people don't have
00:57:15.920 nuclear weapons we do a thing that maybe
00:57:18.760 has some negative effects but is overall
00:57:21.599 good and I think you can kind of apply
00:57:24.680 that sort of logic and reason as a human
00:57:27.200 being to very messy issues I think
00:57:29.480 people do that way people do that with
00:57:31.599 abortion right sure they do that with
00:57:33.920 abortion they a woman has a right to
00:57:36.359 choose reproductive Freedom they say all
00:57:38.640 these things and then you say okay what
00:57:40.799 if the baby is near
00:57:43.079 term what if it's 6 months old what if
00:57:45.760 it's s months old and people don't want
00:57:47.680 to have that conversation a woman has
00:57:49.799 the right to choose you're a fascist
00:57:52.319 stay out of women's bod do woman have a
00:57:54.079 right to kill you if you annoy her or
00:57:55.440 inconvenience her well it's this is
00:57:57.079 where it gets weird like when is it a
00:57:58.799 life but it is one of those things that
00:58:01.119 to me is a human problem whereas humans
00:58:06.200 have these very
00:58:08.960 messy interactions with some things that
00:58:12.400 don't line up with their ideology and
00:58:15.359 there's an ideology of science worship
00:58:18.280 there's an ideology of authoritarian
00:58:20.319 worship the the bodies of science have
00:58:23.240 bestowed the truth if you ignore it
00:58:25.799 you're science denier and you know
00:58:28.920 that's those are political terms or
00:58:30.839 theological terms um they're not terms
00:58:34.119 rooted in science and look I we all make
00:58:38.319 tradeoffs constantly you know what
00:58:40.880 there's you know everything's bad it's a
00:58:43.680 [ __ ] Sandwich versus a [ __ ] croissant
00:58:45.559 I'll take the [ __ ] croissant it's
00:58:46.640 smaller you know like that's that's a
00:58:48.400 daily experience for everybody so I get
00:58:50.640 that and I don't think everything is a
00:58:52.480 moral absolute either you know we don't
00:58:54.240 even know um sometimes whether a
00:58:58.119 decision will result in good or bad so
00:58:59.599 like it's very complicated I totally
00:59:01.480 agree with that what I object to is the
00:59:04.880 absence of reason right like you have to
00:59:08.280 believe because I think it's true that
00:59:10.319 if you're
00:59:11.240 reasonable that you can reach maybe not
00:59:13.319 the perfect decision but a better
00:59:14.799 decision and if we don't believe that
00:59:16.680 then we're just in the land of
00:59:18.079 Witchcraft and let's just admit it so
00:59:21.359 the lack of reason is what freaks me out
00:59:24.520 well it's ideological capture right
00:59:26.680 because there's certain things that if
00:59:28.440 you are on the right side of these
00:59:31.400 subjects the correct side whatever your
00:59:33.480 your ideology believes you can't you
00:59:37.200 can't differ from the doctrine there's a
00:59:39.760 there's a very clear do religion then it
00:59:42.039 is yeah it is religion so I'm very pro-
00:59:44.160 religion but you can't have a religion
00:59:47.200 that's too stupid and destructive if
00:59:49.319 your religion winds up hurting a lot of
00:59:51.000 people then I'm against your religion
00:59:52.559 like that's right yeah I think but even
00:59:55.119 some really good religions have aspects
00:59:57.880 of them that you could say were overall
01:00:00.079 detrimental to the people that were sure
01:00:03.520 absolutely you could say encountered
01:00:04.799 with them I think
01:00:06.760 that that kind of thinking I think cult
01:00:10.319 thinking whether it's Scientology or
01:00:12.880 whether it's Christianity or there's
01:00:14.319 like a type of thinking or it's woke
01:00:16.839 woke is clearly a cult it's a mind virus
01:00:19.920 and I think that you call it's it's so
01:00:22.680 trit to call it that now it's like
01:00:24.200 whatever this thing is this left ISM
01:00:26.640 this Marxist sort of ideology that's
01:00:30.480 waving its flag and and indoctrinating
01:00:33.880 people in this country it's very similar
01:00:35.720 to all kinds of religions it's very
01:00:37.559 similar to
01:00:39.359 fundamentalist religions that have
01:00:41.480 always existed in that everybody has to
01:00:44.480 believe very specific things and you
01:00:46.880 can't differ you can't differ from the
01:00:48.920 doctrine and when so here's another way
01:00:51.440 to think about it that I've been think
01:00:53.680 I've been meditating on this a lot
01:00:56.559 it yes religion politics they're all
01:00:59.720 kind of melding it's hard to know where
01:01:01.720 one ends and another begins right so
01:01:04.000 maybe a simpler and more useful way to
01:01:05.920 think about it is truth or
01:01:09.240 falsehood lying or
01:01:11.640 honesty maybe just assess everything
01:01:13.799 that way is someone lying I don't care
01:01:15.680 what your justification for it is lying
01:01:17.520 about vaccines they've lied a lot about
01:01:19.039 vaccines and they've done it I think in
01:01:21.119 most cases because they feel like
01:01:22.039 they're serving some greater good right
01:01:23.839 well that's the narrative right right we
01:01:25.280 can't tell people that there are vaccine
01:01:27.480 injuries because they won't get vaccines
01:01:29.160 which are good for a big population I
01:01:30.960 understand the thinking but you how
01:01:32.680 about this you can't participate in
01:01:34.559 lying you can't lie you can't lie and
01:01:37.160 you period though you can't lie about
01:01:38.839 anything just don't lie about anything
01:01:40.319 try to tell the truth all the time if
01:01:42.359 you can't say something that's true just
01:01:44.119 don't say it right you're not required
01:01:45.839 to say everything you think obviously
01:01:47.599 and you shouldn't say everything you
01:01:48.720 think but you should never lie and if
01:01:51.119 you just stick with that like you get
01:01:53.720 pretty quickly back to reason and Order
01:01:56.359 don't you yeah yeah no you're making
01:01:59.680 complete sense and I think that um this
01:02:02.720 is the problem when people have
01:02:04.960 information and power above other people
01:02:08.000 well right that's for sure which is the
01:02:09.720 problem of governments which is also the
01:02:11.599 problem of cult leaders yeah you know
01:02:13.640 cult leaders they get completely
01:02:16.279 infatuated with this idea of being
01:02:18.240 omnipro and this this power that has
01:02:22.000 control over giant swats of people and
01:02:25.279 you get to dicte their behavior and you
01:02:27.160 get to tell them what to think that's
01:02:28.960 very intoxicating and it's it's it's
01:02:31.200 common it's common in that it's always
01:02:33.480 existed throughout human history it's a
01:02:35.400 thing that people do when they get power
01:02:37.079 they abuse the [ __ ] out of it and if
01:02:39.440 they think that you're too stupid to
01:02:41.559 know the truth and that they're better
01:02:43.160 than you because they do think they're
01:02:44.240 better than you because they're running
01:02:45.440 things it's a natural inclination it's a
01:02:49.319 natural thought that people have if
01:02:50.640 they're the ones if if you guys are a
01:02:52.520 bunch of dopes that uh are are just
01:02:55.359 listening to my orders and I tell you
01:02:58.319 how to live your life and what to do I'm
01:03:00.520 naturally going to think I'm better than
01:03:01.760 you well that's I mean people have live
01:03:04.119 lived under those systems since there
01:03:06.480 have been systems but always what makes
01:03:09.520 it particularly ging and hard to live
01:03:12.480 with is when you call that system a
01:03:14.640 democracy right that's too dishonest for
01:03:17.079 me it's I would much rather live in a
01:03:19.559 monarchy where everyone thinks the King
01:03:22.319 has been assigned by God to rule over us
01:03:24.359 and his whims are law and you know that
01:03:26.359 makes sense I don't like it but at least
01:03:28.599 it has internal coherence right when
01:03:30.880 they stand up and pass a $60 billion
01:03:33.839 funding bill for Ukraine when 70% of the
01:03:36.920 population doesn't want it when they're
01:03:38.319 ignoring the actual problems in our
01:03:39.880 country like the economy and the border
01:03:41.799 and they're calling in Congress over the
01:03:43.760 weekend to pass something that people
01:03:45.079 don't want while ignoring the things
01:03:47.160 that people do want and if they do the
01:03:48.880 same kind of thing again and again for
01:03:51.200 like 50 years and they call it a
01:03:53.520 democracy that will drive you insane
01:03:56.200 yeah because it's just too dishonest why
01:03:57.960 not just say we don't give a [ __ ] what
01:03:59.520 you want we are getting something out of
01:04:02.440 this Ukraine funding whether it's like
01:04:04.119 the thrill of being Masters of the
01:04:05.720 Universe or whether it's money from the
01:04:07.599 defense contractors whatever we're
01:04:08.839 getting out of it is more important to
01:04:11.119 us than your opinion this is not
01:04:12.920 self-government you don't run this
01:04:14.400 country we do shut up and Obey if they
01:04:17.200 at least said that you'd be like okay I
01:04:18.799 get it those are the terms but if I get
01:04:21.079 another [ __ ] lecture from Joe scarre
01:04:23.359 about defending democracy when this is
01:04:25.839 not a democracy it's not even a close
01:04:27.359 approximation of a democracy then I'm
01:04:29.440 going to go crazy cuz I just can't deal
01:04:31.240 with the lying yeah does that make sense
01:04:33.920 it does make sense what's interesting is
01:04:36.520 that there are people saying that now
01:04:39.039 and I think that's a relatively new
01:04:41.119 thing in terms of mainstream media it's
01:04:44.839 and I consider what you do on X
01:04:47.079 mainstream media I mean this is what
01:04:49.119 we're on right now is essentially
01:04:50.640 mainstream media it used to be you could
01:04:53.720 call it there's corporate controlled
01:04:55.319 media
01:04:56.359 I agree and and that used to be
01:04:59.119 mainstream media mainstream media used
01:05:00.960 to be CNN it's not really anymore
01:05:03.760 mainstream media is what in terms of the
01:05:06.559 volume consumed more people are
01:05:09.200 consuming things on Twitter on X than
01:05:11.799 there are on anything else they're
01:05:13.920 they're consuming information through
01:05:16.200 the internet through YouTube for good or
01:05:18.359 for bad whether it's correct or
01:05:20.079 incorrect they're consuming information
01:05:22.319 in in different forms now than ever
01:05:24.640 before so more people are saying what
01:05:27.000 you're saying than have ever said it
01:05:29.680 before and when when people lie and when
01:05:32.640 people [ __ ] and Gaslight it's more
01:05:34.960 offensive now than it's ever been before
01:05:37.000 because there's so much access to truth
01:05:39.680 that it's just you could see it now if
01:05:41.279 you're paying attention if you're not a
01:05:42.880 boomer who only reads the newspaper you
01:05:45.319 you pay attention and you see it you go
01:05:47.119 this is horseshit but it's it's like I
01:05:49.920 guess what bothers me is that the lies
01:05:51.839 aren't sophisticated no I mean I look
01:05:54.440 back over my Now sort of long life and
01:05:57.680 I'm recognizing all the times that I was
01:05:59.319 lied to but you know I didn't know I was
01:06:00.760 being lied to they kind of pulled it off
01:06:03.480 there's something incredibly insulting
01:06:06.319 and demeaning to tell me a lie when I
01:06:09.720 know it's a lie and you know I know it's
01:06:12.440 a lie we both know it's a lie but you're
01:06:14.240 demanding that I pretend to believe it
01:06:17.000 what you're really saying is I have no
01:06:20.000 respect for you you're like my dog right
01:06:22.480 you're a
01:06:23.480 slave like I'm in that you participate
01:06:27.480 in my lie right the lack of stealth um
01:06:32.079 really do that I'm not explaining very
01:06:33.760 well but that that really bothers me a
01:06:35.839 well there's no real other way to lie
01:06:38.880 you you like some of these lies like
01:06:41.359 politicians like did you see that
01:06:43.720 conversation that AOC had with that man
01:06:46.799 they brought in for the the Biden case
01:06:49.000 and they were talking about uh what what
01:06:51.400 crimes and she was she was like grilling
01:06:54.240 this guy what crimes did you see Joe B
01:06:57.319 did he steal anything did he steal bread
01:06:59.960 like I forgot what she said but and he
01:07:01.839 was trying to explain what they were
01:07:04.520 Rico crimes and she was saying Rico is
01:07:06.880 not a crime it's a category of crime
01:07:09.799 like okay all right but like tell that
01:07:13.920 to the jevy family not only that it's so
01:07:16.960 dumb to say that publicly like and say
01:07:19.920 it with confidence and to tell a person
01:07:22.480 that's the thing the the marriage of
01:07:24.039 inaptitude and high self-esteem is it's
01:07:27.160 really the marker of our time it's like
01:07:29.200 I have nothing against dumb people at
01:07:30.480 all my dogs are dumb and I love my dogs
01:07:32.480 no I'm serious I don't think God cares
01:07:34.160 about your intelligence right only
01:07:35.480 people care and so it's not a moral
01:07:37.720 category and stupidity is not a I mean
01:07:39.720 someone with Down Syndrome I I really
01:07:41.599 believe better people than I am you know
01:07:43.720 more likely to go to heaven so I'm not
01:07:45.400 attacking her for being dumb but the
01:07:47.319 idea that a dumb person has no the White
01:07:49.400 House PR secretaries in the same
01:07:50.400 category who has no idea she's dumb and
01:07:52.880 she really thinks like she won the priz
01:07:55.920 like she's the most impressive like I'm
01:07:57.920 white house prary because I'm the best
01:08:00.240 talker in
01:08:02.680 America so it's so crazy and yet the
01:08:07.039 smartest people I know are very often
01:08:09.079 like sort of well I'm you know they have
01:08:11.119 humility well also she's following uh
01:08:13.960 Kaylee mcenany is that how you say her
01:08:16.080 name I don't really know who that is she
01:08:18.359 was the last white house president you
01:08:20.359 don't know who that is I she the goat I
01:08:22.319 sort of do she's the goat greatest White
01:08:24.799 House Press Secretary of all time she's
01:08:26.799 the best I had stopped paying close
01:08:28.359 attention by that she had all the
01:08:30.439 documents she would kill them she when
01:08:33.520 whenever she would get called out like
01:08:35.679 whenever there would be a question she'd
01:08:36.920 say that's interesting and then she'd
01:08:38.279 open the because you said this and your
01:08:40.759 paper said that and CNN said this and
01:08:43.158 and she would call them out on stuff and
01:08:44.520 she was just really really well
01:08:47.040 prepared very articulate she was
01:08:49.479 wonderful good for her we I mean that's
01:08:51.640 what it should be but she was operating
01:08:53.439 under President Trump you know so uh
01:08:55.560 obviously she's demonized it's just I
01:08:57.640 kind can't believe you don't know who
01:08:58.560 that is no I don't I know who it is but
01:09:01.040 I um it's just funny the she's the goat
01:09:05.679 well that's I had stopped watching all
01:09:07.560 briefings by then I used to go to the
01:09:09.479 briefing as a kid I used I mean I
01:09:11.839 literally would go there be in the
01:09:12.920 briefing room the former Kennedy
01:09:14.198 swimming pool and you and the first
01:09:16.560 thing you not I mean I was never a White
01:09:18.040 House reporter but I would was a
01:09:19.600 reporter so I would go to them
01:09:21.120 occasionally and the first thing you
01:09:22.319 notice is how impressed all the
01:09:23.839 correspondents are to work there I work
01:09:25.120 at the White House work the White House
01:09:26.759 got my my heart pass and then the
01:09:29.960 distance between that that little
01:09:32.080 credential they were so proud of and the
01:09:33.640 reality of their lives was like insane
01:09:36.158 like they're in this tiny little room
01:09:39.198 they're being treated with total
01:09:41.198 contempt by the White House staff who
01:09:43.359 thinks they're just [ __ ] animals you
01:09:45.000 know it's like shut up they're eating
01:09:46.920 out of vending machines and this was a
01:09:49.520 different time right so like when I was
01:09:52.399 working as a journalist in Washington
01:09:53.759 like we went out to lunch every day at
01:09:55.840 like a good restaurant and charge it to
01:09:57.400 the company and like with your sources
01:09:59.360 like we had lunch every single day like
01:10:00.719 civilized people I don't even think that
01:10:01.960 exists in the world anymore where you
01:10:03.520 had time for lunch where you weren't
01:10:05.239 just so under the gun from your
01:10:06.360 corporate Masters you had to like get
01:10:07.719 back to work we we ate lunch and I
01:10:10.560 remember thinking these people don't eat
01:10:12.120 lunch they eat like a a stale Mounds bar
01:10:15.679 out of a vending machine like they bring
01:10:17.199 quarters to work so they can eat I
01:10:19.120 remember thinking your life like is
01:10:22.480 you're you're not even human you're just
01:10:25.159 like a little puppet or something and
01:10:27.080 but you're so impressed and like all
01:10:28.640 your neighbors know you know he he works
01:10:30.120 at the White House he's in the White
01:10:31.360 House Press Corps and the job like
01:10:34.239 wasn't even really a job you would just
01:10:36.040 like sit there and ask your question in
01:10:37.719 your little assigned seat like you're in
01:10:39.239 a high school
01:10:40.520 gym it was just awful and I just had no
01:10:43.760 respect for people who did that for a
01:10:45.520 living at all did you ever read it Fear
01:10:47.880 and Loathing on the campaign Trail come
01:10:49.520 on yeah yeah yeah it's amazing it's
01:10:52.440 amazing that guy uh gave sort of the be
01:10:57.080 that's I think probably the best window
01:11:00.120 into an outsider in the political
01:11:03.000 process at least in terms of the
01:11:04.400 campaign Trail it's the best window to
01:11:07.520 the press the best window to the
01:11:09.640 relationship that they had with the
01:11:10.880 politicians at least in the
01:11:12.640 1970s it's a it's an amazing book I was
01:11:15.440 talking to a campaign reporter I never
01:11:17.000 do that anymore but um I was this week
01:11:20.040 actually and he was telling me it's like
01:11:22.520 totally different like when I did it you
01:11:24.239 were all on a I mean it was bad actually
01:11:26.400 it was because it just cultivated group
01:11:28.600 think which was then leveraged by the by
01:11:31.360 the candidate for better coverage like
01:11:33.280 the whole thing was kind of an OP
01:11:34.560 actually but it was at least fun like
01:11:37.280 you were on a charter plane and like
01:11:38.840 you're flying with everybody and youd
01:11:40.480 hit three or four cities a day and like
01:11:42.480 their cocktails on the plane and you
01:11:44.760 know naughty behavior and like you know
01:11:46.880 they fed you and they kind of DED
01:11:48.320 everything for you it was it was it was
01:11:49.440 fun it was like a road trip right mhm
01:11:51.840 and now it's just like Grim they're all
01:11:54.560 driving alone and their little rental
01:11:56.280 cars to some obscure town in Iowa to sit
01:11:58.960 there with no access whatsoever to the
01:12:00.480 candidate write up their little reports
01:12:01.800 and then they get back to their hotel
01:12:03.880 and they're like writing up more for the
01:12:06.120 website and like it's just an a it's
01:12:08.960 such a bad job actually covering
01:12:11.320 politics that only the people who
01:12:14.000 couldn't make it in any other business
01:12:17.040 are doing it it's like the it's like a
01:12:19.679 reverse meritocracy it's only the most
01:12:23.159 kind of pathetic power worshippers would
01:12:25.960 ever do a job like that and um well like
01:12:28.239 critics yes that's exactly right most
01:12:30.719 critics want to be writers the most well
01:12:33.199 they're like the worst people just as
01:12:35.440 people like well you've actually been in
01:12:37.960 show business so you have got better
01:12:39.800 experience with them or you have a lot
01:12:40.960 of experience with them but I've known a
01:12:43.280 lot of them who work for magazines or
01:12:45.040 newspapers that I work for and they're
01:12:48.000 the kind of people who have a lot of
01:12:49.440 cats and all the cats hate them you know
01:12:52.239 what I mean
01:12:56.239 they're just they're just like the
01:12:57.560 lowest they all have some like sort of
01:13:00.199 weird like wandering eye and they're fat
01:13:02.320 and they're like super into porn and
01:13:05.679 totally isolated from everybody I
01:13:08.040 actually
01:13:08.840 worked for for one of them for a while
01:13:12.080 who was a Critic for the New York
01:13:14.280 Post a guy called John P hearts and he
01:13:16.800 was he was one of the weirdest most
01:13:18.719 unhappy people I've ever met in my life
01:13:21.760 and he would come into my office
01:13:23.679 occasionally and he was rub his he had a
01:13:26.280 really hairy back and he would rub it
01:13:27.840 against the door frame this and like say
01:13:31.520 these kind of obscure he was stupid but
01:13:33.360 he didn't know that he was he was
01:13:34.840 actually kind of dumb but he didn't know
01:13:36.840 it and he would kind of philosophize I
01:13:39.400 was like 10 years younger and I was his
01:13:41.080 captive so he would just like lecture me
01:13:42.639 as he was rubbing against the door frame
01:13:44.120 and one time we went out to lunch and uh
01:13:47.080 we all had drinks of course this is like
01:13:49.040 mid90s he didn't really drink but he
01:13:51.400 ordered this drink with like a an
01:13:54.120 umbrella and and it had a water piece of
01:13:56.960 watermelon on the rim of the glass and
01:13:59.480 he took the watermelon ate it and then
01:14:00.800 he ate the Rind I'll never forget that
01:14:03.639 watching him eat the rind and thinking
01:14:06.760 of course this guy's a
01:14:08.400 Critic was his true love he was editing
01:14:11.280 this magazine but like his his real
01:14:13.440 interest was in writing about movies
01:14:15.840 and it was and they're just sad people
01:14:18.400 who did you ever read uh you know CIS
01:14:20.800 and Ebert did you ever read when uh CIS
01:14:23.880 Roger eert rather wrote wrote a he wrote
01:14:25.800 a screenplay no it's very bizarre it's
01:14:29.920 it's really sexual very strange it's
01:14:32.760 supposed to be terrible of course I've
01:14:35.040 read passages in it it's terrible but I
01:14:37.360 remember going
01:14:39.320 oh okay yeah they're not they're not
01:14:42.280 creative they're creative adjacent well
01:14:44.440 they don't have anything to contribute
01:14:46.280 that's what I'm saying they don't have
01:14:47.480 creative power right so they're that
01:14:50.480 they probably could figure it out if
01:14:52.120 they had a different mindset I think
01:14:54.000 creativity is everybody it's just a
01:14:56.199 matter of how 100% it's in everybody it
01:14:58.320 just requires honesty yeah the
01:15:00.679 impediment to creativity is lying sure
01:15:03.280 and yeah I used to say that about joke
01:15:04.920 thieves that one of the real problems
01:15:07.199 with joke thieves is when they get
01:15:08.480 caught and then they have to write their
01:15:10.159 own material and the problem is they
01:15:12.639 don't understand the language they just
01:15:14.679 know how to say the sounds like if you
01:15:16.880 told me what to say in French I can't
01:15:18.520 speak French but if you told me what to
01:15:20.000 say and I practice it and I said it
01:15:22.040 right you would think wow that guy
01:15:23.400 [ __ ] speaks French yes so that's what
01:15:25.719 comedy's like so if you got a guy who
01:15:28.239 knows how to repeat other people's jokes
01:15:30.120 but he doesn't know how to create them
01:15:32.000 see comedy is one of the rare things
01:15:34.199 where someone when when a like you get a
01:15:37.480 guy like uh Shane Gillis that guy writes
01:15:41.159 his own stuff he edits it it he thinks
01:15:44.080 it out in his head he performs it he
01:15:46.280 produces it he changes the order of
01:15:48.560 things I love that it's a complete
01:15:50.400 everybody does it pretty much the same
01:15:52.480 way there's a few guys that hire writers
01:15:55.040 and there's that's honorable there's
01:15:56.560 nothing wrong with hiring a writer and
01:15:58.040 it's also it gives jobs to other Comics
01:15:59.960 cuz some Comics are just really good
01:16:01.440 writers and they're not so good at
01:16:02.960 performing and so people will work on
01:16:04.920 stuff they'll collaborate on stuff like
01:16:06.920 Chris Rock would do this thing where he
01:16:09.520 would hire comics and they didn't write
01:16:12.080 the jokes for him but they would be like
01:16:14.400 guys who would bounce stuff off so he
01:16:16.159 would have his ideas he would go on
01:16:17.639 stage and then after his set they would
01:16:19.560 all meet and they would talk about the
01:16:21.280 set and you know guys would have
01:16:23.120 taglines like you could say this oh
01:16:25.480 great and they write that down they're
01:16:26.880 adding so it's a collaboration so you
01:16:29.159 have the the the master you have Chris
01:16:31.320 Rock who is so open-minded and
01:16:34.360 intelligent and humble that he brings in
01:16:37.000 other Masters and says tell me what I'm
01:16:39.120 doing wrong tell me what I could change
01:16:41.600 tell me what I can make better and they
01:16:43.080 work together and then there's people
01:16:44.880 that have people that are essentially
01:16:46.520 ghost riters they hire Comics to write
01:16:48.239 jokes for them they pretend they're
01:16:49.480 theirs and they don't really write them
01:16:51.000 at all so that's another level which is
01:16:52.840 to also anyone who does that get
01:16:56.120 successful I don't know I don't know I
01:16:59.360 don't not top shelf they get clo they do
01:17:03.000 well there's there's people that have
01:17:04.760 people right for them and they do well
01:17:06.800 but they're not the guy that everybody
01:17:08.000 goes to they're not David tell they're
01:17:09.880 not the guy that everybody goes to see
01:17:11.320 they're not the like David tell is the
01:17:12.679 guy the comics go to see when he's in
01:17:14.280 town yes like he just he's a master he's
01:17:16.560 you watch him he's Yoda you're like
01:17:17.960 Jesus Christ like how is he so good well
01:17:20.159 he's so good because he writes every day
01:17:22.280 because he's sitting with [ __ ] a pack
01:17:24.199 of cigarettes and a cup of coffee every
01:17:26.040 morning writing things in a notebook and
01:17:28.239 he's practicing every day he goes on
01:17:30.320 stage constantly and he's just it's that
01:17:32.679 Japanese term Kaizen where you take this
01:17:34.960 one thing and just refine it to its
01:17:37.280 ultimate Mastery that's what he's doing
01:17:39.760 so these guys who pretend to be that and
01:17:41.920 steal jokes and then they get caught
01:17:44.679 then their material drops off a cliff
01:17:49.080 it's so obvious because frauds yeah also
01:17:51.960 because the very thing that allows you
01:17:55.080 to steal someone's jokes that's an ego
01:17:58.800 thing that's a like I want the laughs I
01:18:01.800 want to be the man or the woman I want
01:18:04.400 to be the [ __ ] one up there showing
01:18:07.120 everybody ah look how amazing this
01:18:09.840 person is right look how amazing that's
01:18:12.679 the opposite mindset that's required for
01:18:15.080 creativity so creativity is not about
01:18:17.840 you creativity is about the ideas
01:18:20.280 creativity is about things creativity is
01:18:22.560 about how does this concept work with
01:18:25.000 these other Concepts how do I how do I
01:18:27.480 get it in the most digestible form if I
01:18:29.480 was an audience member what would be
01:18:30.920 like to feel this how what's the best
01:18:32.880 way to introduce it what's the way to
01:18:35.040 make it so that people don't think that
01:18:36.960 I'm being mean that I have a point or
01:18:39.760 that I've thought this through this is
01:18:41.239 not just a flippant thing like you're
01:18:43.400 allowing someone when you when someone's
01:18:44.880 on stage you're allowing that person
01:18:47.159 almost to think for you like you're like
01:18:49.560 take me on a ride like I I'll give you
01:18:51.960 my mind I'm not going to I'm not going
01:18:54.040 to be thinking I would do I'm not going
01:18:56.080 to I'm just going to let you think for
01:18:57.360 me if that person's not doing a good job
01:19:00.080 of that if it's clunky if it's shitty if
01:19:02.960 the the the transitions suck if the way
01:19:05.840 then it just interrupts this hypnos
01:19:08.159 hypnotism that you've put on me this
01:19:10.360 hypnosis it's it's a now I'm not let
01:19:13.639 inherently fraudulent yeah right I mean
01:19:16.360 I'm giving control of my mind over to
01:19:20.320 someone who is himself under the control
01:19:22.679 of somebody else
01:19:25.080 do you know what I mean mean if you're
01:19:25.880 stealing no if I'm in the audience right
01:19:29.199 and I would say this also goes for for
01:19:32.159 ideas for commentary you know that's not
01:19:34.440 funny but that's real right and you see
01:19:37.480 it a lot I've seen it a lot yeah you see
01:19:39.719 [ __ ] a lot well the number of people
01:19:41.840 who are totally not controlled who are
01:19:44.080 really saying what they actually believe
01:19:46.280 with no weird agenda that they're not
01:19:47.840 telling you about is pretty small yeah
01:19:50.679 and I just have noticed that a lot
01:19:53.000 recently particularly on the question of
01:19:54.960 wokeness and Free Speech there are a lot
01:19:57.360 of people who are like on your side
01:19:59.719 because they're for free speech who
01:20:00.920 we're not actually for free speech at
01:20:02.280 all who are pushing uh you know a very
01:20:06.040 specific foreign policy agenda for
01:20:07.880 example and using another issue to lower
01:20:12.320 your defenses and let themselves into
01:20:14.400 your brain um and I think that's really
01:20:17.840 Sinister really really really Sinister
01:20:20.159 and it's becoming more obvious now like
01:20:21.920 if you're for free speech then you're
01:20:23.920 just for free spee because you support
01:20:25.280 the principle it doesn't the content of
01:20:26.760 the speech is is not that interesting to
01:20:28.679 you the fact that a sovereign human
01:20:31.159 being has the right to express himself
01:20:32.679 because he's not a slave he's a citizen
01:20:34.560 and a human being like that's what
01:20:36.320 matters yeah and if all of a sudden you
01:20:38.719 like become famous like I'm for free
01:20:40.800 speech and then you support silencing
01:20:44.679 people who articulate opinions you
01:20:46.520 disagree with like you're a fraud you're
01:20:49.320 kind of a Sinister fraud yeah yeah and I
01:20:52.679 that cuz that's the business I'm in I
01:20:54.320 boy I've really noticed that have you
01:20:55.920 noticed this yes and that's also the the
01:20:57.920 same kind of thing when you hear them
01:20:59.520 talk if you hear someone talk that's
01:21:02.639 saying something that's kind of
01:21:04.920 horseshit you it resonates with you that
01:21:07.480 that's you've you've seen you had a
01:21:09.000 moment with Barry Weiss on your show
01:21:11.000 that went everywhere I saw a clip of it
01:21:13.520 I never saw the show itself but she was
01:21:15.920 going on about she was posing as one
01:21:18.840 thing and then you pressed her like well
01:21:20.199 hold on a second what do you mean by
01:21:21.480 that you just attack somebody and she
01:21:22.880 had no idea what she was talking about
01:21:24.920 and it became really clear to me
01:21:26.159 watching that completely changed my view
01:21:27.560 of Barry Weiss forever I was like oh
01:21:29.199 this she's a fraud actually this
01:21:31.639 person's not honest at all like she has
01:21:34.000 a a very specific agenda that's all she
01:21:36.840 cares about the rest of the stuff is
01:21:39.679 just a is a kind of slight of hand
01:21:41.960 maneuver you're talking about the thing
01:21:43.280 with tulsy gabber that's correct yeah
01:21:44.920 she called her a to and she didn't know
01:21:46.520 what that meant well but she had no idea
01:21:48.560 like telsey gabard had straight outside
01:21:50.080 the lines on some Syria or something
01:21:52.719 uhuh um and and Barry Weiss was you know
01:21:57.480 going through the files in her head like
01:21:59.040 what does she have to
01:22:00.600 believe and she was aware that you know
01:22:03.520 tulsy Gabbert has somehow violated that
01:22:05.360 in a way that no one's willing to say
01:22:07.400 like in detail to fully articulate what
01:22:09.520 did Tulsa Gabbert do wrong no one will
01:22:10.760 tell you she's just bad yeah and then
01:22:14.600 what that revealed about Barry Weiss is
01:22:16.080 she's completely dishonest like she's a
01:22:18.239 liar actually you can't if by the way if
01:22:20.800 you attack somebody particularly
01:22:22.239 personally and can't explain why you're
01:22:23.840 attacking the person
01:22:26.159 like that's not acceptable you're a
01:22:27.760 dishonest person if you can't explain
01:22:29.440 why I think it's a common thing that
01:22:31.239 people do in private and they get
01:22:35.199 accustomed to speak like we're we're
01:22:37.120 talking like we're talking in private
01:22:38.800 we're just two people talking right so
01:22:40.480 people get accustomed to saying things
01:22:42.679 without being able to back them up you
01:22:44.719 know like oh he's a vaccine denier I've
01:22:47.560 done a ton of that in my life I as well
01:22:49.400 because I'm an [ __ ] so it's like I
01:22:51.239 just don't like that person okay I have
01:22:52.560 as well but what I'm saying is I don't
01:22:53.800 know how much time Barry Weiss had spent
01:22:55.960 doing podcasts before that well she
01:22:58.360 spent a look I'm I'm just saying
01:23:01.000 like but I think important to be honest
01:23:03.440 about what your agenda is I think she is
01:23:05.120 honest I think she is honest and I
01:23:06.960 really like her I like talking her she's
01:23:09.440 a very intelligent against her
01:23:11.000 personally I just think that was a
01:23:12.440 mistake and I think you're allowed to do
01:23:14.960 that and hopefully learn from that and
01:23:16.600 don't do that anymore don't don't say a
01:23:18.560 thing that you and I've done that I've
01:23:20.400 done definitely done that I've said a
01:23:21.719 thing and I wasn't really exactly sure
01:23:23.120 what I was talking about my gosh I do
01:23:24.719 every day and I may have just done it
01:23:26.000 with Barry Weiss so let me be a lot more
01:23:27.400 specific about what I mean if your
01:23:30.080 agenda is neocon politics which is her
01:23:32.880 agenda just say so don't pretend to be a
01:23:36.639 defender of free speech as a principle
01:23:38.360 which is what she does how is she a
01:23:39.600 defender of neocon politics very wise
01:23:42.199 yeah like what what
01:23:43.840 specifically well anyone including me
01:23:46.159 and tulsy gabard who thinks that America
01:23:49.320 shouldn't be funding Wars that don't
01:23:50.719 help America she will attack um as as a
01:23:54.960 Traer to America or whatever whatever it
01:23:57.080 takes and so no no no that's her that's
01:23:59.719 her main interest which is fine and by
01:24:01.159 the way I actually have friends who I
01:24:02.880 disagree with really strongly on this
01:24:04.719 question who believe in neocon politics
01:24:06.880 doesn't mean they're terrible people or
01:24:08.679 I hate them or I'm not friends I'm still
01:24:10.159 friends with them but they're very
01:24:11.920 direct about it this is what I care
01:24:13.280 about okay fine you know I really care
01:24:16.159 about bird hunting and fly fishing and
01:24:18.159 or whatever I can and you don't that's
01:24:19.920 totally cool but be honest about it so
01:24:24.120 if your job is to defend the right of
01:24:26.880 free people to say what they really
01:24:29.280 believe then go ahead and defend it and
01:24:31.600 if somebody is not allowed to speak or
01:24:34.040 fired from his job for having an opinion
01:24:36.880 that you disagree with defend him anyway
01:24:39.920 I I just interviewed a guy who is a
01:24:42.360 black nationalist socialist okay so I'm
01:24:45.080 obviously not much of a black
01:24:46.199 nationalist I don't know if you're aware
01:24:48.080 of that but I'm not and I'm not a
01:24:49.760 socialist either but this guy is facing
01:24:52.719 prison time under the Biden doj because
01:24:56.760 he said things they don't like about
01:24:58.000 foreign policy and I just interviewed
01:24:59.320 the guy for an hour and it was like I'm
01:25:01.520 because on principle you should be able
01:25:03.440 to say what you think period what is
01:25:04.960 this gentleman's
01:25:06.119 name I he was actually a it turns out I
01:25:09.320 like loved him um oh and I'm embarrassed
01:25:12.520 I can't he's he's a member of a pretty
01:25:16.400 small black nationalist socialist group
01:25:18.560 it's like the Revolutionary black
01:25:20.080 nationalists or something like that
01:25:21.520 they're out of uh out of Southwest Flor
01:25:24.360 Florida and um he's literally facing
01:25:27.320 prison for repeating Russian
01:25:29.320 disinformation he's not even accused of
01:25:30.960 doing anything he's accused of saying
01:25:33.159 things that Biden doj doesn't like well
01:25:35.360 in a what were these things that he said
01:25:37.960 repeating Russian propaganda about about
01:25:41.080 the invasion of Ukraine and his point
01:25:43.679 was well there's a backstory here which
01:25:45.760 is that NATO has been moving Eastward
01:25:47.719 since
01:25:48.639 1991 and that's a massive threat to
01:25:51.000 Russia missiles on their border from a
01:25:52.840 hostile power is a threat and and the
01:25:54.960 bid Administration accelerated that and
01:25:58.040 in response Putin invaded eastern
01:26:00.880 Ukraine now you can disagree with that
01:26:02.679 but that's hardly a crackpot view by the
01:26:04.159 way I think it's actually true but even
01:26:05.880 if you don't agree that it's true that's
01:26:07.280 not you don't have to be a paid
01:26:09.159 propagandist of the from the Kremlin to
01:26:10.840 say that right I have said it I'm not a
01:26:13.440 paid propaganda is this a gentleman
01:26:14.920 that's him right there four Americans
01:26:16.480 from a black ower organization work with
01:26:18.520 Russian intelligence to spread
01:26:20.040 propaganda fed to spread propaganda now
01:26:23.760 propaganda
01:26:25.119 first of all you know there's a lot of
01:26:27.560 propaganda scroll up a little on that
01:26:29.239 Jamie so I can read what this is saying
01:26:31.119 it's covered up oh okay right guy is
01:26:35.119 that guy right there okay subscribe real
01:26:36.840 quick yeah the people's Democratic uru
01:26:38.840 movement in St
01:26:40.760 Petersburg so so he contacted he spoke
01:26:44.600 with someone in Russia they spoke with
01:26:46.760 people in Russia and then he no no no he
01:26:48.920 is being um he's charged with felonies
01:26:51.320 the FBI raided his house the first thing
01:26:53.800 they did was cover up the security
01:26:55.880 cameras and they went in there and
01:26:58.360 arrested they raided by the
01:27:00.679 FBI okay Russia's foreign intelligence
01:27:03.040 service allegedly weaponized our first
01:27:04.800 amendment rights freedoms russan to
01:27:06.960 divide Americans and interfere elections
01:27:08.520 in the US says Assistant Attorney
01:27:10.639 General Matthew Olsen now first of all
01:27:13.440 weaponized our first amendment rights no
01:27:17.119 your first your first amendment rights
01:27:19.840 are never a crime right they're
01:27:23.000 god-given
01:27:24.320 the government did not bestow them you
01:27:26.040 were born with them as a free person
01:27:28.400 period and the First Amendment simply
01:27:30.159 says you can't interfere with their
01:27:31.679 exercise that's it and in this they are
01:27:35.400 and and I looked at I I read this and I
01:27:37.000 thought and I reached out to this guy by
01:27:38.719 the way Matthew Olsen no I wish Matthew
01:27:41.360 olon would never do my show I mean the
01:27:42.840 guy whose salary I pay as a US citizen
01:27:44.520 no he would never speak to me listen
01:27:46.600 look at that that quote Russia's foreign
01:27:48.520 intelligence Services Alle allegedly
01:27:51.320 weaponized our first amendment rights
01:27:52.920 freedoms Russia Den its own citizens to
01:27:55.920 divide Americans and interfere in
01:27:57.760 elections in the United States that you
01:28:00.000 got to like why are you saying that say
01:28:02.960 what happened well but nothing but
01:28:05.000 nothing happened so that's the thing so
01:28:06.360 I'm reading this someone sent it to me
01:28:07.960 and I'm like okay clearly there's a
01:28:09.480 crime here like they were found with I
01:28:12.360 don't know mortar shells or they were I
01:28:15.040 mean usually the government makes up
01:28:16.520 they put kitty kitty porn on your
01:28:17.840 computer at least to discredit you
01:28:19.840 there's no underlying crime other than
01:28:21.920 they said something that the foreign
01:28:23.679 policy is establishment of the United
01:28:24.960 States disagrees with okay that's not a
01:28:27.679 crime by definition and this guy is
01:28:29.520 facing life in prison and it looks to me
01:28:31.520 cuz no one cuz Barry Weiss has not
01:28:32.960 defended him um I think this guy is
01:28:36.040 likely to spend the rest of his life in
01:28:37.360 prison and I'm like this is
01:28:39.199 crazy the rest of his life in prison yes
01:28:42.440 okay hold this is the thing he's I think
01:28:44.199 he's 83 yes how do you say his name
01:28:47.920 yella and three other US citizens Penny
01:28:50.840 Joanne hes Jesse Nel and August C Roma
01:28:55.000 Jr are charged with conspiracy to
01:28:56.880 defraud us hess uh oh okay you defraud
01:29:02.280 the United States uh hes yella and Nel
01:29:05.679 are also charged with impersonating
01:29:07.520 agents of a foreign government okay they
01:29:10.080 say to defraud the United States so
01:29:12.719 defraud suggests theft of something of
01:29:16.199 value right if I defraud you I steal
01:29:18.400 your money there's no allegation of that
01:29:20.960 at all and I actually read the charges
01:29:23.639 there's no the only allegation is they
01:29:25.920 said things that the US government the
01:29:28.199 bid Administration doesn't like that's
01:29:29.840 it and because they're unpopular and
01:29:32.239 they have views that are considered quot
01:29:33.920 quote
01:29:35.320 Fringe you know like crazy black
01:29:38.440 nationalists nobody wants to defend them
01:29:41.280 and my only point is not that I'm like
01:29:43.560 such a principled person this Al this
01:29:45.440 seems very obvious to me you can't allow
01:29:48.000 that you absolutely cannot allow that if
01:29:50.480 you believe in the first amendment in
01:29:52.480 the freedom of free people to say what
01:29:53.800 they think think so what this this
01:29:56.159 implication is they're saying that they
01:29:57.920 they were recruited um by the FSB so it
01:30:02.000 says uh prosecutor said ianov operated
01:30:05.760 an entity called the anti-globalization
01:30:07.639 movement of Russia that was used to
01:30:09.639 carry out its US influence efforts
01:30:11.760 overseen by the Russian intelligence
01:30:13.239 service known as FSB they recruited
01:30:15.719 us-based organizations to help sway
01:30:18.320 elections make it appear there was a
01:30:20.480 strong support in the US for Russia's
01:30:22.520 invasion of Ukraine and backed efforts
01:30:25.000 such as the 2015 United Nations petition
01:30:27.520 to decry the genocide of African people
01:30:30.520 in the US according to the
01:30:32.880 indictment back efforts what does that
01:30:35.560 mean look at that like it's negative to
01:30:38.040 back efforts to such as the 2015 United
01:30:42.840 Nations petition to decry the genocide
01:30:46.480 of African people but what just look at
01:30:49.199 that statement backed
01:30:52.159 efforts such as a thing to decry
01:30:56.639 genocide the United Nations Petition of
01:30:59.119 2015 to decry the genocide of African
01:31:02.040 people in the US according to the
01:31:04.080 indictment okay so the real
01:31:06.000 misinformation and propaganda is in the
01:31:07.960 charging documents actually the real
01:31:11.000 Liars here are the Biden doj officials
01:31:14.480 who did this and they're dangerous
01:31:15.760 they're criminals in my opinion but if
01:31:17.920 you read it carefully you will see that
01:31:20.960 the only crime is having opinions
01:31:24.360 that the people in charge didn't like
01:31:25.920 and were they in contact with people
01:31:27.920 from Russia yeah I think they went over
01:31:30.040 to Russia for some
01:31:31.560 conference so so they over by way but
01:31:34.679 the way this typically works is they say
01:31:35.920 well you went to a country against which
01:31:38.280 we've imposed sanctions right and you
01:31:40.560 violated the sanctions regime in some
01:31:42.320 way like that's how they get you they're
01:31:44.360 not even alleging that they're not even
01:31:46.239 alleging that they're just saying you
01:31:48.360 said things that we don't like that by
01:31:50.320 the way a foreign government we don't
01:31:51.760 like agrees with
01:31:54.560 they learned those when they went over
01:31:56.360 to Russia learn it's all on the internet
01:31:59.320 they're they learned them I mean I guess
01:32:01.920 it doesn't matter where they learned
01:32:03.199 them I would because I've talked to the
01:32:05.560 guy and I've seen what they wrote the
01:32:07.280 opinions that they
01:32:08.920 expressed I don't you know the genocide
01:32:11.440 of African peoples in America I don't
01:32:13.119 even know what that means um I guess I
01:32:15.800 don't agree with that but their views on
01:32:17.880 Russia I generally agree with because I
01:32:20.280 think they're true and so does Jeff
01:32:22.800 Sachs and a lot of non-ra non-black
01:32:25.440 nationalists would probably agree with
01:32:26.960 the basic framework of their position
01:32:28.800 but whether we agree or not is not
01:32:30.760 relevant right all that matters is in a
01:32:34.400 free country which this was when I grew
01:32:37.040 up you have the right to any opinion you
01:32:39.080 want you do not have the right to hurt
01:32:40.280 people you don't have the right to steal
01:32:41.239 from them you don't have the right to
01:32:43.239 defraud people but you certainly
01:32:46.239 foremost have the right to any opinion
01:32:48.360 you want no matter what the people in
01:32:49.800 charge think of it in fact you have that
01:32:51.760 right as a bull workk against tyranny by
01:32:56.159 the people in charge like that's the
01:32:57.920 only thing that keeps this country free
01:32:59.400 is my right to have any opinion I want
01:33:03.119 and this guy is going to jail for his
01:33:05.239 opinions and you know I it's so crazy
01:33:09.280 that I kept thinking like is there
01:33:10.679 something that I'm missing like it does
01:33:13.080 seem a little Fringe this group I'd
01:33:14.840 never heard of them I'm not sending them
01:33:16.239 money okay um they must have done
01:33:18.760 something nope nothing and you should
01:33:21.080 see the video of the FBI right it's
01:33:22.360 unbelievable they sent they sent like
01:33:25.280 it's on the Internet it's on X I have
01:33:27.119 the video on there they sent like 40
01:33:30.440 armed agents with automatic weapons to
01:33:32.719 this guy's office and his house like no
01:33:35.040 exaggeration it was a full-blown like
01:33:37.280 we're arresting Al Chapo type thing for
01:33:39.679 this guy he's like an 83-year-old army
01:33:42.480 veteran it's
01:33:44.280 outrageous and I really find it
01:33:47.320 baffling that nobody who's like against
01:33:50.119 woke culture or whatever will touch it
01:33:52.119 and the reason they won't touch it is
01:33:54.080 because their foreign policy
01:33:56.360 views in general are more important to
01:33:58.880 them than their views on speech in the
01:34:00.960 First Amendment no views on America well
01:34:04.480 if you step out of line right so the
01:34:07.880 ideology is that we must support Ukraine
01:34:11.080 right so this is the Russia has a point
01:34:14.320 this is what they're saying so Russia
01:34:16.520 was very upset about the movement of the
01:34:19.080 weapons closer to their borders the the
01:34:22.719 the joining NATO all all the stuff that
01:34:26.159 was the hard red lines that Putin had
01:34:28.199 already set like if Russia Russia would
01:34:32.000 definitely do something if Ukraine join
01:34:34.040 NATO we all knew that so if you deviate
01:34:38.280 from that you're going to be in trouble
01:34:40.679 so better just ignore it because you
01:34:43.239 can't you you clearly if you look at who
01:34:46.199 these people are I mean these These are
01:34:48.199 people that would be supported by the
01:34:49.480 left whole wholeheartedly well they are
01:34:51.800 I mean it's like the Revolutionary
01:34:53.159 socialist yeah yeah they're not they're
01:34:55.159 not at CPAC this year but the left has
01:34:56.800 to ignore it because then 100% it
01:34:59.800 conflicts with this C left are just like
01:35:02.719 now they're actually ridiculous they
01:35:04.600 don't mean anything in fact we've moved
01:35:07.440 past the point where they don't mean
01:35:08.719 anything they do mean something they are
01:35:11.320 propaganda instruments designed to cloak
01:35:13.560 the truth from the rest of us that in
01:35:15.280 fact there's agreement not disagreement
01:35:17.199 at the center of power they all agree on
01:35:19.560 the things that matter and those are the
01:35:21.600 economy and foreign policy cuz that's
01:35:23.239 where the money is there's no effort to
01:35:26.119 say re in the credit card
01:35:28.159 companies which if you really cared
01:35:30.400 about the country say but people really
01:35:32.000 suffering okay they don't have enough
01:35:33.280 money to live kids can't not only not
01:35:35.920 buy houses they can't afford rent and
01:35:38.719 why is that and one of the main reasons
01:35:40.639 is because they're paying like close to
01:35:42.159 20% interest on their credit cards
01:35:44.840 and okay we just imagine that in a free
01:35:47.719 market that's a good thing tell me why
01:35:49.280 that's a good thing who benefits from
01:35:50.719 that why are we for that again I'm not
01:35:52.199 for that I think I think the credit card
01:35:54.280 companies are
01:35:56.360 villains and they send credit cards to
01:35:59.679 kids at school and get them hooked on
01:36:01.480 this I think it's totally wrong and if
01:36:04.239 you said that in the US Congress people
01:36:05.480 would look at you like you had three
01:36:06.440 heads like what they just don't care
01:36:09.119 because there's they all agree that our
01:36:11.840 current economic system and our current
01:36:13.440 foreign policy assumptions are good so
01:36:16.040 that's not a two-party system that's a
01:36:17.320 one party system and it doesn't serve
01:36:19.320 the interest of the country and my
01:36:21.040 position is super simple the only
01:36:23.320 country country I have an emotional
01:36:24.719 attachment to as the United States
01:36:26.040 that's it I like lots of countries I
01:36:27.520 like almost all countries actually I've
01:36:28.840 been to a lot of them I like them all
01:36:30.719 but the only one I feel emotional about
01:36:32.239 is the United States because I live here
01:36:33.800 I was born here my kids are here it's my
01:36:35.920 country and most of the people in our
01:36:39.040 foreign policy conversation do not feel
01:36:41.400 that way so that distorts it really
01:36:45.000 dramatically and there also a lot of
01:36:47.000 them are are violence worshippers like
01:36:48.760 they get off on war they get off on
01:36:50.719 hurting people and on the power that
01:36:53.840 that um imbus them with and I think you
01:36:56.080 know the Liz
01:36:57.320 Cheney
01:36:58.880 model you know what I mean like someone
01:37:00.920 like Liz Cheney who's got like a really
01:37:02.560 sad and Barren personal
01:37:04.560 life a lot of them are this way weird
01:37:07.400 personal life failed personal life like
01:37:09.800 they don't have people who love them
01:37:11.000 they don't have kids who respect them
01:37:13.159 and so Adam kinzinger whatever they're
01:37:15.320 all kind of the same the more broken
01:37:17.639 they are inside the more focused they
01:37:19.560 are on like war and foreign policy
01:37:22.480 because it gives them a Feeling of of
01:37:24.199 power and strength and success like I
01:37:26.480 can't get my wife to respect me I can't
01:37:29.280 get my kids to listen to me I can't pass
01:37:31.360 any meaningful domestic agenda but what
01:37:34.360 I can do is Bomb the living [ __ ] out of
01:37:36.639 a foreign
01:37:37.600 country and um there so there is this
01:37:39.920 it's not true for all of them but for a
01:37:41.599 lot of them there is this
01:37:44.199 syndrome uh that drives their behavior
01:37:47.199 but whatever the reason it's totally
01:37:49.000 disconnected from what's good for the
01:37:50.360 country and if you run America you have
01:37:52.400 one job
01:37:54.119 one job and that's improve America
01:37:56.440 period they don't see it that way and I
01:37:58.880 so I don't think the system can continue
01:38:01.000 because it's too distorted it's it's not
01:38:04.840 serving its original purpose at all so
01:38:07.800 what was it that these guys said that
01:38:11.040 made this raid possible they said Russia
01:38:15.639 and I don't want to speak for them like
01:38:17.960 I interview anyone who wants to see it
01:38:19.520 can interview and I just want to say
01:38:21.000 again like one of the cool things about
01:38:23.000 this moment that I did not anticipate
01:38:24.520 there's all this sad stuff happening I
01:38:25.920 know that you probably experience this
01:38:27.119 all the time is like finding not only
01:38:30.239 common ground with people you thought
01:38:31.480 you had nothing in common with at all
01:38:33.800 but also like liking them you know like
01:38:36.159 I actually liked the guy I'm sure we
01:38:37.560 disagree a million things probably mad
01:38:39.800 at white people I am a white person
01:38:41.800 whatever but like in my conversation I
01:38:43.920 was like I like this guy you know he's
01:38:45.480 honest and he's sincere he's principled
01:38:48.360 he was a veteran you know but whatever
01:38:50.480 no I really think what they said was
01:38:52.920 what I have said and a lot of people
01:38:54.679 have said um which is there was a reason
01:38:57.199 for this Invasion I personally think the
01:38:59.199 invasion was a bad idea didn't help
01:39:00.520 anybody I'm against War I'm sad the
01:39:02.280 war's ongoing but they were pushed to
01:39:05.360 this by a more powerful country which
01:39:07.280 would be the United States of
01:39:08.679 America with the threat of including
01:39:11.719 Ukraine in NATO it's really simple and
01:39:13.920 right before the invasion days before
01:39:15.320 the invasion they send poor Comm Harris
01:39:18.159 who has no idea what day it is to the
01:39:20.159 Munich security conference an area she
01:39:22.760 knows nothing about no experience in it
01:39:24.400 at all and they send her there for one
01:39:25.639 purpose which is to announce at a press
01:39:27.239 briefing with all the cameras rolling to
01:39:29.239 zinsky right there she says we want you
01:39:31.880 to join NATO what you no no other NATO
01:39:37.040 members were clamoring for Ukraine it
01:39:39.400 didn't even qualify for NATO membership
01:39:41.320 why would you say that when Clinton when
01:39:43.599 Putin's got troops masked on the
01:39:45.599 Ukrainian border you send your vice
01:39:48.040 president to the Munich security
01:39:49.159 conference with the world watching and
01:39:50.599 say this that no one even really wants
01:39:52.360 why would you do that to Prov War
01:39:54.040 obviously what's the other reason and it
01:39:57.000 was scripted like KLA Harris is not
01:39:59.040 freeballing stuff like she's saying what
01:40:01.280 she's told to say obviously it's not her
01:40:02.800 area she doesn't know anything about
01:40:03.800 this stuff she was told to say that but
01:40:06.480 why to provoke a war obviously so that
01:40:10.440 was my read I said that on Fox News not
01:40:12.719 a lot of people liked it but it just
01:40:13.920 seemed obvious to me I'm not making
01:40:16.280 excuses for Putin please uh I want to
01:40:21.280 protect the United States and I think
01:40:22.400 this war really hurts the United States
01:40:23.840 like my motives are always right out
01:40:25.520 there anyway I think they said a species
01:40:28.080 of that something like that and and the
01:40:31.440 last thing I'll say is that why was the
01:40:34.119 reaction so strong because it was true
01:40:36.159 they don't care if you lie no one in
01:40:38.119 power cares if you lie but a lot of
01:40:40.080 people are say they care when you tell
01:40:41.159 the truth a lot of people are saying
01:40:42.800 those things and they're not getting
01:40:44.360 he's like some black nationalist guy in
01:40:46.119 St Petersburg like who cares we can do
01:40:48.280 who's going to defend him nobody he's
01:40:51.080 some wacko he's some like 80 y old guy
01:40:54.080 who's like been in the like Fringe left
01:40:56.560 movement for the past 50 years you know
01:40:59.719 like new Huey Newton and stokeley
01:41:01.719 Carmichael he's like a relic of the past
01:41:03.440 and like he doesn't have a constituency
01:41:04.760 he doesn't care the modern democratic
01:41:06.400 party hates him he hates them and the
01:41:09.440 Republican party is like black
01:41:11.080 nationalism no thanks so he has no
01:41:13.920 constituency they're never going to like
01:41:16.679 you could say that and what are they
01:41:18.199 going to do to you you know nothing
01:41:20.880 because they're they can't but this guy
01:41:24.320 yeah crush him kill him and that's
01:41:26.520 exactly what they're doing and I really
01:41:28.080 think not to be like a' 70s liberal
01:41:29.840 about it if you let the weak get crushed
01:41:33.320 it's bad it's super bad you need to
01:41:35.119 protect the weak and this guy's
01:41:37.040 weak and so you think they're making
01:41:39.800 example out of him with this and they
01:41:41.960 can they have all this power this I just
01:41:44.000 don't understand why they would move so
01:41:46.639 many people why why they would get so
01:41:48.599 many agents why they would do this so
01:41:51.119 publicly for one guy's opinion or one
01:41:53.880 group of people's opinion well I don't
01:41:55.960 know I mean why did why did medieval
01:41:58.679 kings hang the heads of people they
01:42:00.480 executed from the gates right but it
01:42:02.320 feels like there should be more to it
01:42:03.719 like what what did they say so the the
01:42:05.800 problem is you're telling me I know the
01:42:07.840 problem is that I mean I'm just straw
01:42:09.400 I'm steel Manning this rather so the
01:42:11.159 problem is that they went over to Russia
01:42:13.679 and they talked with people in Russia
01:42:15.920 and then they're saying these things is
01:42:17.440 that the problem they're not charged
01:42:18.520 with that they're not charged with going
01:42:20.480 to Russia but you think that's the
01:42:21.599 motivation behind it because they they
01:42:23.360 went over there this a different article
01:42:25.400 uh has a quote from him okay yeah they
01:42:28.239 are not C at least when I interviewed
01:42:30.599 him they had not been charged with
01:42:32.440 taking money from Russia so it says
01:42:34.920 they've been accused of us they've
01:42:37.360 accused us of taking money from Russia
01:42:39.280 yesel said yesterday at a news
01:42:41.080 conference on July 29th we've never
01:42:42.760 taken any money from Russian government
01:42:44.719 but I'm not saying that because I'm
01:42:46.360 morally opposed to taking money from the
01:42:48.239 Russians or anyone else who wants to
01:42:49.719 support the struggles for black people
01:42:52.280 don't tell us we can't don't tell us
01:42:54.599 that we can't have friends that you
01:42:56.400 don't like he accused the UF government
01:42:58.880 US government of seeking to use the
01:43:02.040 apsp As It Pawn in its proxy war with
01:43:05.599 Russia the unsubstantiated allegation
01:43:07.960 that opponents of the war are
01:43:09.719 co-conspirators with a foreign power are
01:43:12.320 intended to bolster The Phantom of a
01:43:14.199 Russian Boogeyman in the public
01:43:15.960 Consciousness the escalating military
01:43:17.920 aggression by the us against Russia and
01:43:19.679 China is already being accompanied by
01:43:22.360 increasing oppression and an attempt to
01:43:24.719 criminalize left-wing opposition to the
01:43:27.280 unpopular
01:43:28.920 War well exactly so they're accusing him
01:43:31.800 of taking money from Russia they're not
01:43:33.840 they're not charging him so here's the
01:43:35.639 distinction which is like really really
01:43:38.480 important so there are two levels on
01:43:40.440 which the Department of Justice in all
01:43:43.159 administrations acts there's the level
01:43:46.040 of propaganda like what do we want
01:43:48.320 people to think and there's the level of
01:43:50.080 law what are we charging someone with
01:43:52.199 and you have to ignore the first and pay
01:43:54.639 very close attention to the second so we
01:43:56.960 have a legal system we have laws and you
01:43:58.840 can't actually go to jail unless you
01:44:00.199 violate one under the terms of our
01:44:01.920 system and so ignore what they're saying
01:44:04.480 about you Joe Rogan sucks he's a bad man
01:44:07.679 but in the end I'm busting you for
01:44:09.280 double parking and so really you're not
01:44:11.199 a bad man you're a double Parker under
01:44:12.800 the law and so if you look at the
01:44:14.679 charges against these guys they're
01:44:15.840 they're not charged with
01:44:17.400 violating sanctions
01:44:20.639 regulations they are charged with
01:44:24.119 totally Amorphis quote crimes like
01:44:27.960 defrauding the US government not for
01:44:30.040 money but for like defrauding it like I
01:44:34.480 guess counter signaling
01:44:37.719 it sending a message publicly that they
01:44:40.520 don't like I mean there's no crime look
01:44:42.520 it up except
01:44:44.639 speaking and I think that's a precedent
01:44:48.159 that we don't want to live with no no
01:44:51.719 doubt all right I'm G take a leak yeah
01:44:54.239 let's take a leak we'll be right back
01:44:55.679 we're gonna pee Tucker and I are gonna
01:44:57.199 pee
01:44:58.960 together yeah well that's the the
01:45:02.199 confronting of reality you're forced to
01:45:05.280 examine your beliefs and why you came to
01:45:07.159 those beliefs in the first place no that
01:45:08.880 is the beauty of this moment though it
01:45:10.800 is people are living uh intentionally
01:45:13.400 much more and it's also just much more
01:45:15.360 interesting it's not just you know it's
01:45:18.239 less shallow than it was for sure I
01:45:20.080 think so I think it's more nuanced
01:45:21.920 people have more Nu at least the people
01:45:23.520 that are paying attention have a more
01:45:24.920 nuanced perspective but then you have
01:45:26.840 the people that are in the Echo chambers
01:45:28.520 that are just digging their heels in
01:45:30.040 even more and you could spot them easily
01:45:33.080 because they well they're missing out
01:45:34.679 because there's nothing more liberating
01:45:36.400 than admitting you were wrong MH I mean
01:45:38.840 that is the that is like the moment of
01:45:40.679 Liberation right and that's the basis of
01:45:43.040 religion it's the basis of AA it's the
01:45:44.760 basis of anything that improves you as a
01:45:46.639 person is admitting honestly admitting
01:45:49.199 to other people not just to yourself
01:45:50.960 that like wow I got that wrong yeah and
01:45:53.159 then you're free cuz then you don't have
01:45:54.639 to hide it anymore right very important
01:45:57.159 and it's a beautiful thing and that is
01:46:00.199 like changing your mind I always notice
01:46:01.920 this covering politics that you know a
01:46:03.560 candidate would be like I've got him on
01:46:05.239 tape saying 10 years ago something
01:46:07.000 different and no one ever asked my
01:46:08.960 opinion but I always wanted to say why
01:46:10.199 don't you just why don't you say you're
01:46:11.880 absolutely right and the country's a lot
01:46:13.440 different from what it was 10 years ago
01:46:14.840 and so my opinions changed too like why
01:46:16.520 wouldn't they cuz I'm not a freaking
01:46:17.840 robot or a liar also I used to think
01:46:21.080 this because of that and now I realized
01:46:23.800 I was wrong exactly yeah which how great
01:46:25.880 is that I mean it's part of being a
01:46:27.880 human it's not being a flip-flopper it's
01:46:29.760 the best part of being a human well this
01:46:32.040 is an interesting time for that because
01:46:33.760 you see people that won't do that and
01:46:36.159 you could recognize them easily because
01:46:37.639 they're the first people to throw out
01:46:38.760 insults the first thing they do when
01:46:40.760 they describe you they'll describe you
01:46:42.280 in an insulting way and then they'll say
01:46:45.040 what they disagree with you about
01:46:46.920 they'll say something hard they try to
01:46:48.599 Define you they you're far right white
01:46:51.679 supremacist
01:46:54.239 racist yeah they throw it all at you and
01:46:57.440 then they say what you said it's so
01:46:59.840 funny I got called racist and white
01:47:01.639 supremacist so many times but when I
01:47:03.320 first was called that I mean it really
01:47:05.599 stung you know a lot because just of
01:47:08.800 where I grew up and how I grew up and
01:47:11.719 those are like the worst things you
01:47:12.679 could ever call somebody and um so I
01:47:15.679 actually like paused for a moment and
01:47:19.360 thought am I like I which I think it's
01:47:21.760 fair to ask yourself like am am I a wh
01:47:23.840 whatever that I've never figured out
01:47:25.360 what that was am I a racist not really
01:47:29.159 and I thought really the people I
01:47:30.599 dislike most are almost all white
01:47:32.960 liberals actually so you're racist
01:47:36.400 against white people no but like no I I
01:47:38.920 I am white my kids are white I'm not
01:47:40.159 against white people I like white people
01:47:41.520 but um no it's not that it's that so a
01:47:45.440 reporter once called me about this
01:47:46.920 you've been called racist like no
01:47:47.880 actually really just like you if I were
01:47:49.440 sort of narrow down my bigotries it's
01:47:50.960 like people like you I just think you're
01:47:52.199 disgusting
01:47:53.480 I really mean it too RAC racist okay all
01:47:57.400 right well it's a it's a thing you know
01:48:00.679 I don't think that works as much anymore
01:48:02.080 it doesn't work no well I think a lot of
01:48:04.480 the things that you overuse eventually
01:48:07.080 people realize like oh you're you're
01:48:08.800 you're yelling wolf again yeah well of
01:48:12.040 course and when people get hit with it
01:48:14.040 and don't disappear then it becomes
01:48:16.360 obvious that lacks power well it's also
01:48:19.800 you're trying to like use these words
01:48:22.800 Define someone especially someone like
01:48:24.440 you that has so many hours and hours of
01:48:27.080 talking about things like to to try this
01:48:29.440 reductionist perspective of someone to
01:48:31.480 reduce them to this ultimately very
01:48:33.800 negative thing and not say that they're
01:48:35.639 a human being and also the fact that
01:48:38.360 it's done by the people that want to
01:48:39.639 think of themselves as compassionate and
01:48:41.560 kind which is the most bizarre the the
01:48:44.320 left is so
01:48:45.840 aggressively
01:48:47.400 incompassion like they they're so
01:48:49.360 aggressively unkind with letting letting
01:48:52.000 people die of drug Odes on the sidewalk
01:48:54.280 that's compassion no it's not that whole
01:48:55.880 thing is [ __ ] crazy well it's cruelty
01:48:58.840 actually it is and it's also when you
01:49:00.480 find do you know [ __ ] Noz the yeah great
01:49:04.239 guy he opened my eyes to the
01:49:06.360 homelessness thing we had him on the
01:49:07.880 podcast and he was explaining how he was
01:49:09.320 in San Francisco and he was like what is
01:49:11.440 this is like they don't have any money
01:49:12.719 for this is that what it is like no
01:49:14.760 there's a whole business behind it
01:49:16.520 course and these people that are running
01:49:18.639 this homelessness initiative or whatever
01:49:21.159 the [ __ ] they call it they're making
01:49:22.960 hundreds of thousands of dollars a year
01:49:24.520 some of them a quar million dollars a
01:49:25.719 year imagine making money off the
01:49:27.239 homeless and not doing a goddamn thing
01:49:29.639 but what's so funny is I I I do think
01:49:31.679 the root of their power and the one
01:49:33.440 thing they're good at is just charging
01:49:36.800 the moral High ground and taking it in
01:49:38.800 the first moments of the battle yeah
01:49:40.800 they just run up to the moral High
01:49:42.239 ground and like we've got this this is
01:49:43.639 ours and they'll protect that at all
01:49:44.880 costs and it's like that's kind of all
01:49:46.159 they have is this self-righteousness and
01:49:49.480 if you can puncture that it's like
01:49:51.280 you're getting rich from the homeless
01:49:54.000 actually yeah and is there anything more
01:49:56.440 disgusting than that it's some junkie
01:49:58.599 who's dying in misery outside the
01:50:01.679 convention center in San Francisco and
01:50:03.320 you're making money on that they're
01:50:04.520 essentially using those people as a
01:50:06.000 battery to expand the power of
01:50:07.639 government yeah their own personal
01:50:09.480 Advantage yeah they're they're expanding
01:50:11.320 government they're making more
01:50:12.760 government employees now there's tons of
01:50:15.119 people that are working on the
01:50:16.199 homelessness problem air quotes and uh
01:50:19.800 you know they probably all have blue
01:50:20.920 hair and they talk nonsense and
01:50:23.520 nothing's getting done and no one's
01:50:25.199 being punished for it but when they when
01:50:26.560 they did that study where they said that
01:50:28.119 that they had no data like how are
01:50:32.040 you what you you can't say whether or
01:50:35.400 not it's doing anything yeah you well
01:50:38.199 how'd you spend $24 billion but why are
01:50:40.920 they not treated as like the most
01:50:43.440 reprehensible people in our society I
01:50:45.560 think there's too many things to think
01:50:46.800 about I think most people unlike you and
01:50:49.119 I aren't even paying attention to it
01:50:51.079 they're paying attention to the fact
01:50:52.079 that the tents are are there they're
01:50:53.199 paying attention to if you go to Los
01:50:54.360 Angeles it's a [ __ ] zombie apocalypse
01:50:56.639 but what they're not paying attention to
01:50:58.760 is what is going on how many people are
01:51:01.360 making money I didn't even know until
01:51:02.840 colon explained it to us I had no idea I
01:51:05.920 I thought it was just they don't have
01:51:06.760 any money they don't put any money in it
01:51:07.960 and they let these people sleep there oh
01:51:09.440 no no there's actual M all these
01:51:11.560 parasites yeah parasites government
01:51:13.440 parasites those are real of course and
01:51:16.040 you know this whole idea of I've created
01:51:18.239 so many jobs like what jobs are they
01:51:20.320 government jobs that are just [ __ ]
01:51:22.199 cuz there a lot of those what's crazy to
01:51:24.560 me just having spent most of my life in
01:51:26.560 Washington is how close this is to the
01:51:29.960 lawmakers physically so the US capital
01:51:32.920 sits across from something called Union
01:51:34.960 Station which is a really beautiful
01:51:36.400 train station um right on Capital Hill
01:51:39.320 and so to get into the capital you when
01:51:41.520 there's a massive homeless City there
01:51:44.239 people dying of drug Odes right there
01:51:46.360 and so to get to work every day
01:51:48.079 lawmakers have to like step over the
01:51:49.800 bodies of fellow Americans
01:51:53.199 dying like dying living Outdoors
01:51:56.280 [ __ ] in the bushes addicted to drugs
01:51:58.840 which is Hell okay and they have to
01:52:01.119 ignore that on their way to creating
01:52:03.960 Utopia in some foreign country and
01:52:06.280 you're like does it ever occur to you
01:52:09.000 that that's disgusting that your primary
01:52:11.760 duty is to the drug addict your fellow
01:52:14.199 American you're doing nothing and you're
01:52:16.599 telling me how we're going to make
01:52:18.280 Eastern Europe into you know this Brave
01:52:21.119 New World
01:52:23.239 I don't know I just can't get past that
01:52:25.040 I think I'm not super sensitive or aware
01:52:27.560 or anything I'm not super anything
01:52:29.079 really I'm pretty ordinary but I think I
01:52:30.800 would notice I would I was like walking
01:52:34.000 into VOD in Ukraine Aid I'd be like [ __ ]
01:52:36.400 there are like five junkies on the
01:52:38.199 street like maybe we should do something
01:52:39.520 for them no yeah yeah it's very bizarre
01:52:42.520 it's bizarre that they can rationalize
01:52:44.280 it or at least that they don't get
01:52:45.880 called out by all their people and this
01:52:49.560 idea that it's compassionate that you
01:52:51.800 have compassion to leave these people
01:52:53.360 and to give them Aid and to help them
01:52:54.679 and give them clean needles but then
01:52:56.960 you've got to think like maybe there's
01:52:58.480 something bigger going on
01:53:00.360 actually because there's no yes there's
01:53:03.159 an entire sector of the economy now that
01:53:06.159 feeds off of human Misery the drug
01:53:08.840 treatment centers that don't work the
01:53:10.760 homeless Advocates who create more
01:53:12.560 homeless the you know migrant workers
01:53:16.480 you know American Born Aid agencies
01:53:19.960 workers who you know increase illegal
01:53:22.199 immig ation and gang activity and all
01:53:24.400 this you know people are making money
01:53:26.199 off this the arms manufacturers that
01:53:28.040 help kill people in foreign countries
01:53:29.920 etc etc there's a viig and all of that
01:53:32.960 it's a scam it's a grift etc etc but
01:53:35.520 like there's something more like there
01:53:37.480 are a lot of people who seem to be just
01:53:39.520 like for evil for its own sake and
01:53:42.760 you're like maybe all the like crazy
01:53:46.599 talk about a spiritual war of like good
01:53:48.760 and evil maybe there's something to that
01:53:51.239 maybe that's not an illusion maybe
01:53:53.400 that's like everyone else has always
01:53:55.079 thought that there are certainly forces
01:53:58.079 that have evil consequences that exists
01:54:01.320 but they act on people from the out and
01:54:03.079 you feel it also on the other side I
01:54:05.280 mean people are better than they
01:54:06.679 naturally are sometimes like you feel
01:54:09.199 compassion for people or true empathy
01:54:11.360 for someone or you you really want to
01:54:13.320 help someone there's no advantage to you
01:54:14.800 at all like why are you doing that it's
01:54:16.440 almost like you're being acted on by
01:54:17.960 good and all of us have known those
01:54:19.760 moments where we just are cruel for the
01:54:21.400 sake of it hurt someone for the sake of
01:54:22.960 it what's that there's no advantage to
01:54:25.239 us that's evil acting on us and I think
01:54:27.760 we're seeing it at scale and like I grew
01:54:29.920 up in the most secular world you could
01:54:31.360 ever grow up in Southern California in
01:54:33.920 the 70s and 80s and in a very secular
01:54:36.480 family and I've never really paid much
01:54:38.079 attention to that and all of a sudden
01:54:40.199 every not everyone a lot of people I
01:54:42.199 know who had similar childhoods to mine
01:54:44.719 similar life experiences are like maybe
01:54:47.760 there is like a supernatural realm maybe
01:54:49.920 there's more than just like what we can
01:54:51.960 see
01:54:53.079 and feel maybe life is more than just
01:54:55.040 ordering [ __ ] on Amazon maybe there's
01:54:56.639 like a purpose maybe there is this
01:54:58.079 battle between good and
01:54:59.520 evil uh around us that we can't see but
01:55:01.760 that we do experience a lot it seems
01:55:03.920 like it's always been a narrative
01:55:05.119 throughout human history it's always
01:55:06.800 been this recognition Carls over there
01:55:10.480 snoring I don't have my headphones on so
01:55:12.920 I can hear
01:55:13.880 them you're snorting or snoring snoring
01:55:16.599 Carl snoring Carl the dog you oh Carl
01:55:20.040 the dog Carl the dog SN oh he's the best
01:55:23.320 but he snores when he sleep cuz he's a
01:55:24.920 little French
01:55:26.840 Bulldog he's a sporty little Bulldog
01:55:29.280 he's awesome yeah he's the best dogs
01:55:32.159 don't get cuter they might be as cute
01:55:34.320 but they don't get any cuter than Carl I
01:55:36.520 think that's right yeah I've got some
01:55:38.280 pretty good-looking dogs I will say yeah
01:55:39.679 I have a beautiful dog I have a golden
01:55:41.119 retriever but he's not as cute as Carl
01:55:43.719 Carl's a different thing don't tell him
01:55:45.079 that he knows he doesn't like Carl well
01:55:48.040 he he doesn't hate Carl but he like
01:55:50.079 ignores him he thinks of Carl as a thief
01:55:52.679 of attention only which he is yeah yeah
01:55:56.440 fair
01:55:57.800 so we've always human beings have always
01:56:01.760 at least believed that there are forces
01:56:04.040 of Good and Evil and that they they
01:56:07.960 that's what exorcisms are about right
01:56:10.840 the idea that you're possessed that
01:56:12.599 you're possessed by evil there's always
01:56:14.239 been this thought that there's good and
01:56:15.960 evil but when did you
01:56:18.719 start when did you start considering
01:56:21.239 that and thinking that that's cuz
01:56:23.199 weren't you at one point in time you
01:56:24.520 weren't you a a Grateful Dead head oh
01:56:27.040 yeah ien listened to him this morning
01:56:29.159 yeah he used to travel around with them
01:56:31.400 yeah how old were you when that was
01:56:33.400 going
01:56:34.760 on um I went to my first dead show in
01:56:38.520 December of 1984 so I was 15 at speaking

01:56:50.320 played at the um in San Francisco
01:56:53.560 and so we were in Tahoe over Christmas
01:56:55.679 and for some reason my my dad was gone I
01:56:58.000 don't really know where so my brother

01:57:14.480 uh I remember being on the freeway
01:57:17.520 like at 15 well we had a pretty
01:57:21.719 different of childhood um but anyway uh
01:57:26.920 anyway we did is that you yeah it's me
01:57:29.040 on the left get the [ __ ] out of here
01:57:31.239 yeah I don't know you know I don't know

01:57:35.119 barn and I've never you know I don't
01:57:37.440 release any pictures of myself or family
01:57:39.840 or anything like that and somebody came
01:57:41.480 to my barn and took a picture of that's
01:57:43.199 hanging next to my sink and um and put
01:57:46.079 it on the internet wow so that's my
01:57:48.400 brother Buckley on the right um that
01:57:51.760 picture was taken so my dad was a
01:57:54.360 reporter in San Francisco in the 60s and
01:57:57.480 um pretty well-known reporter and that
01:58:00.239 was in the 80s when I was in school and
01:58:02.679 we were home for Christmas vacation and
01:58:05.000 he had covered the Grateful Dead he knew
01:58:06.199 the Grateful Dead my dad did so they
01:58:08.599 were uh in his office they like came
01:58:11.320 through DC and they like called him and
01:58:12.920 they came over to his off Jerry came
01:58:14.360 over to his office and my dad's like I
01:58:15.679 got Jerry garc here you guys should come
01:58:17.000 down so my brother and I we lived in
01:58:19.119 Georgetown and we had a vesa remember
01:58:20.920 those yeah and we drove our vesa was
01:58:23.199 freaking cold out I'll never forget that
01:58:25.119 we drove our vesa down to 6th and e or
01:58:28.079 whatever where my dad's office was and
01:58:29.800 there was Jerry I'd never met him before
01:58:31.480 he was missing the middle finger of his
01:58:33.079 right hand famously you know the famous
01:58:35.360 handprint grateful that handprint and
01:58:37.360 but when you shook his hand you could
01:58:38.560 feel his it collapse kind of because he
01:58:40.400 didn't have that middle finger but but
01:58:42.320 anyway so my brother and I drove to this
01:58:44.760 to the to the New Year show was actually
01:58:46.159 a couple nights before New Year's and we
01:58:48.400 didn't have tickets of course and um we
01:58:50.639 were in the park across
01:58:52.639 from there and we were you know whatever
01:58:54.320 doing the you know whatever things that
01:58:57.119 people do at Dead shows and we were
01:58:58.280 pretty freaking out of it and this guy
01:59:01.239 comes up out of nowhere and puts a
01:59:04.320 ticket around his face he goes here and
01:59:06.119 hands me a
01:59:07.280 ticket so my brother um was extremely
01:59:11.719 out of it I mean he was you know I never
01:59:14.159 should have done this but I was like all
01:59:16.679 right man I'm going in all right and I I
01:59:19.639 left my little brother in the park
01:59:22.280 during the show just like very very
01:59:24.480 impaired like super super impaired I it
01:59:26.599 was completely wrong to do something
01:59:28.320 like that but I did do it and then I
01:59:30.400 went in and saw the show kind of freaked
01:59:32.760 out in the middle of it hid in the men's
01:59:34.320 room for a while never forget that
01:59:36.280 standing on the the stall smoking
01:59:38.840 cigarettes is it acid trying to it was
01:59:41.239 no it was uh psilocybin mushrooms which
01:59:43.960 by the way I should just say I got sober
01:59:46.280 22 years ago I'm completely opposed to
01:59:48.639 anything like I don't take Adil like I'm
01:59:50.159 totally opposed to anything but um other
01:59:52.560 than nicotine and coffee but yeah it was
01:59:54.000 mushrooms so we ate way too many and um
01:59:56.800 started
01:59:57.840 to to uh to kind of melt down a little
02:00:01.639 bit but anyway the point is I get out of
02:00:03.320 the show this is pre selfa this is
02:00:05.400 1984 and I get out of the show and they
02:00:08.960 played actually a lot of tunes that they
02:00:10.760 didn't play they played Spoonful like
02:00:13.360 they didn't play Spoonful a lot it was
02:00:14.880 like a pretty obscure tune I'd never
02:00:16.520 heard it before actually and uh I
02:00:18.280 couldn't find my brother my little
02:00:20.199 brother and I'm like in charge and you
02:00:22.440 know my closest friend and lifelong
02:00:24.719 friends talked to him this morning and
02:00:26.719 uh but I couldn't find him and I was
02:00:29.000 like oh man my brother's gone but there
02:00:32.320 he was he appeared like an hour later he
02:00:35.199 had spent the entire show in somebody's
02:00:37.360 van there but he seemed undamaged and uh
02:00:43.040 it was great I mean not everything about
02:00:44.440 it is great I mean I do think the drug
02:00:46.520 thing got you know definitely hurt
02:00:49.239 people for sure but from my perspective
02:00:51.599 I went to a bunch probably 50 or more
02:00:53.320 shows and really enjoyed it and um I
02:00:57.400 love the fact that they had two drummers
02:01:00.440 that was a huge thing for me I love
02:01:01.880 Rhythm I think it's I think it's the
02:01:03.800 basis of music it's obviously the basis
02:01:05.239 of music I mean the instrument
02:01:06.199 instruments are are cool but they're
02:01:07.960 kind of like interior design and the the
02:01:10.440 architecture is rhythm and it's the
02:01:12.840 universal sound that every every culture
02:01:15.719 appreciates because it's it reflects
02:01:17.880 something that's pre-existing that's in
02:01:19.320 you everyone relates to Rhythm and I
02:01:21.400 just AB absolutely loved the drums and I
02:01:24.560 love they would always play like it was
02:01:26.159 called drums actually but they would
02:01:27.679 play a section of every show was just
02:01:29.320 drums um Bill kin and Mickey Hart just
02:01:31.719 going crazy on the drums and they had
02:01:33.079 drum circles and and I just like drums
02:01:35.599 to this day I listen to drums just just
02:01:38.400 percussion King Sunny ad day um the
02:01:42.800 Great West African drummer and uh anyway
02:01:45.560 whatever so yeah I like the Greatful
02:01:47.000 Dead a lot and still do and I like that
02:01:48.840 kind of
02:01:49.800 music jam music I like J music I like
02:01:53.320 acoustic music I love blueg grass love
02:01:56.239 blueg grass and Americana and to see
02:01:58.440 that grow to see Billy strings become
02:02:00.560 like a venue Packer you know like Billy
02:02:02.679 strings is like a big act right now I do
02:02:06.320 feel like creativity art has been
02:02:08.440 completely destroyed and eliminated in
02:02:10.000 the United States there's like you as we
02:02:11.840 were saying earlier you can't be
02:02:13.840 creative if you're not honest it's that
02:02:16.159 simple and we can't be honest so there's
02:02:17.960 no creativity and in the visual arts and
02:02:19.719 literature and architecture it's Di
02:02:22.679 but comedy is still alive thank heaven
02:02:25.480 and music for some reason has escaped
02:02:28.639 that and is still alive yeah and the
02:02:30.960 growth the explosion of acoustic
02:02:34.480 Bluegrass you know the banjo like one of
02:02:36.400 the great instruments ever um is just
02:02:39.199 thrilling and like a sign of life you
02:02:42.079 know at this late at this late stage
02:02:44.840 well I think when there's social
02:02:46.840 pressures and when society's in chaos
02:02:49.679 art does tend to thrive some kind of art
02:02:53.239 some art that's right comedy certainly
02:02:55.119 does now like comedy's never been better
02:02:58.639 amazing time it came close oh yeah yeah
02:03:01.800 the walls got breached whoa no but a few
02:03:05.159 a few years I don't know when it was but
02:03:06.880 you know eight years ago or something it
02:03:08.560 felt like oh wow you know people can't
02:03:11.400 tell jokes anymore we kept doing it I
02:03:14.079 noticed and yeah we kept doing you kept
02:03:16.880 the little little Embers alive yeah well
02:03:19.800 there was it was flames it's just you
02:03:22.960 you know when you get people in a club
02:03:25.440 and you take their phones away and just
02:03:27.360 have them just be actual human beings
02:03:29.079 and not be filming everything just being
02:03:32.280 completely trapped with this idea of
02:03:34.639 capturing something and then putting it
02:03:36.000 online then you get to have a human
02:03:37.840 experience you mean when people like
02:03:39.480 live in the present rather than in the
02:03:41.239 future far away that's one of the great
02:03:43.599 things about dat line going to a good
02:03:45.599 club that uses Yonder bags for your
02:03:48.079 phones is that it just takes you out of
02:03:50.679 like at the very least it's a break like
02:03:52.960 like this podcast is is a break for 3
02:03:55.920 hours of phones there's no I'm not no
02:03:58.520 one's checking phones love that that's
02:04:01.559 very rare with human beings where they
02:04:03.840 can just sit down and just have
02:04:05.079 conversations for long periods of time
02:04:07.520 without being distracted by something
02:04:09.320 not in my house but yeah it's a real
02:04:11.119 problem with folks it's a huge problem
02:04:13.079 it's a huge problem and I the one thing
02:04:15.360 I will say about my very unconventional
02:04:17.760 childhood is there was a huge premium on
02:04:19.520 meals and like eating with people
02:04:22.400 and spending 4 hours at the table was
02:04:24.679 like totally normal in the house that I
02:04:26.559 grew up in totally normal in fact it was
02:04:27.960 like daily and um that was our primary
02:04:32.400 form of entertainment and mode of
02:04:34.840 communication and you know thing that we
02:04:36.760 did for fulfillment and fun and I still
02:04:39.119 do that I still feel that way and we
02:04:42.199 have dinner parties constantly and there
02:04:43.920 are no phones and people talk and
02:04:46.400 entertain each other and it's like it's
02:04:48.000 so much more interest I'm not on social
02:04:49.679 media but if I were on social media I
02:04:52.239 don't think I would find that on
02:04:53.440 Instagram I'm just and I'm not attacking
02:04:55.079 Instagram but I don't think I would find
02:04:57.599 that anything like that no it's it's
02:05:02.280 it's definitely a lost thing and it's
02:05:04.760 such an easy thing it's such a fun thing
02:05:06.520 it is a fun thing yeah it's a great
02:05:08.520 thing and I think people enjoy it I
02:05:09.960 think that's also led to the rise of
02:05:11.679 podcast too because they don't they
02:05:13.440 don't get that in their real life so at
02:05:14.960 least they get to be a person who sits
02:05:16.520 in on these conversations I got to say
02:05:18.199 this is not being suck upy cuz I don't
02:05:20.760 suck up ever to anyone but the effect
02:05:24.119 that podcasts have had is just is just
02:05:26.400 incredible and I never would have
02:05:29.280 predicted that in million freaking years
02:05:32.679 I would have never thought it when when
02:05:34.679 I first started doing this it was in my
02:05:36.800 living room with my friend Brian and we
02:05:38.960 did it on a laptop and we had a webcam
02:05:41.960 and we were like with my friend Brian
02:05:44.159 yeah Brian redband of kill Tony you met
02:05:46.440 Bri yes I did I just no but I just love
02:05:48.679 the phrase with my friend Brian like
02:05:50.679 every bad story like my friend Brian we
02:05:54.679 were we were down to Mexicali and I just
02:05:57.159 me and my friend Brian we just started
02:05:58.719 [ __ ] around online and then then we
02:06:01.360 started eventually bringing in guests
02:06:03.320 and then we eventually got a studio and
02:06:05.480 then eventually I got you know a big
02:06:08.360 place in La like a real warehouse and
02:06:11.199 then eventually moved to Texas it it all
02:06:13.639 just eventually happened but it's it was
02:06:17.320 not I mean I was in another part of
02:06:18.880 media for that whole period And if you
02:06:21.199 had asked me up until the last few years
02:06:23.639 like the future is clearly shorter
02:06:27.360 crisper more produced right right
02:06:30.440 everybody would have thought that
02:06:31.599 exactly everyone did think that
02:06:33.000 including me and I hated it you know I
02:06:34.800 hat it I like long form but I never I
02:06:36.639 was a long form magazine writer for
02:06:38.040 years so I I thought but I thought that
02:06:40.679 was over yeah not over everybody thought
02:06:43.760 that yeah even my friends they were
02:06:45.400 telling me how to edit my show they're
02:06:47.040 like you should edit that no one's going
02:06:48.520 to listen at 3 hours I'm like then don't
02:06:50.320 listen okay
02:06:52.559 do whatever you want I'm not I'm not
02:06:53.840 making any money doing this it was just
02:06:55.360 for fun I love that it was just fun for
02:06:57.880 years for years and years I did it just
02:07:00.639 with no money there was no money in it
02:07:02.719 forever what year like how many years in
02:07:05.079 did it start to pay for itself
02:07:07.920 five that's a long time yeah a long time
02:07:12.280 it was took a while I mean it was making
02:07:15.199 it was probably like sub
02:07:19.159 existing yeah but about 5 years in then
02:07:21.679 it started making money and then it was
02:07:23.119 like oh this is a business I remember
02:07:24.760 very clearly I was on stage Once in
02:07:26.679 Chicago I was doing the Chicago theater
02:07:28.960 and I had this story that I was going to
02:07:30.520 tell I'm like how many people listen to
02:07:31.800 the podcast and there's 3,700 people in
02:07:34.400 the place and they went nuts it was like
02:07:37.360 yeah and I was like
02:07:40.880 oh like I thought there was this like
02:07:42.960 thing that I'm doing where you know a
02:07:45.199 few people are paying attention I don't
02:07:46.559 even know what the I didn't even back
02:07:48.480 then I never even knew what the numbers
02:07:50.719 were I didn't I didn't even care just
02:07:52.239 well they may not have been like could
02:07:54.119 you even collect numbers accurately yeah
02:07:55.840 you can get downloads off of uh you know
02:07:58.280 like the whatever the uh provider was
02:08:01.040 that was um with the host you could get
02:08:03.920 like download numbers from the host and
02:08:06.280 they they would use that to inform ads
02:08:08.320 like oh he gets x amount of downloads
02:08:10.920 per month and then they would you know
02:08:13.000 that's when there's very few people
02:08:14.599 advertising on podcast all right let's
02:08:16.520 give it a try but it's one of the great
02:08:20.079 developments between
02:08:21.960 podcasting and Billy strings like I have
02:08:24.920 I'm serious I have hope that it's not
02:08:27.079 all going in the wrong direction cuz you
02:08:28.599 can get this view that like everything
02:08:31.159 is falling apart late Rome yeah just a
02:08:34.599 matter of time before you know it really
02:08:36.719 does collapse and then you see these
02:08:38.280 signs that are not minor you know
02:08:40.639 they're significant that like no people
02:08:43.760 I mean I haven't met a person in the
02:08:46.320 past year who said you know I thought
02:08:48.159 this but then I was reading the New York
02:08:50.079 Times and I realized I was wrong like
02:08:51.719 not one person right but the number of
02:08:54.239 people say I was listening to this
02:08:55.360 podcast I was listening to Rogan and d d
02:08:57.800 it's like yeah really
02:09:00.320 noticeable yeah that's why it's
02:09:03.360 interesting it's it's it's interesting
02:09:05.480 because you could put people in front of
02:09:07.920 people and they might not even be right
02:09:10.280 they might be wrong but at least now
02:09:12.360 you're having conversations about
02:09:14.639 something you would never have a
02:09:15.679 conversation about before and even if
02:09:18.159 this person gets exposed as being
02:09:20.040 incorrect well now you have a more
02:09:22.040 nuanced understanding of what the
02:09:23.760 subject is about why people think
02:09:25.679 incorrect things and you know this idea
02:09:29.159 of like platforming people is a big one
02:09:31.239 today why would you platform that person
02:09:34.119 first of all platform is not a verb and
02:09:36.679 whenever they take a perfectly good noun
02:09:38.920 and turn it into a verb you know
02:09:41.480 something bad is a foot okay platform Oh
02:09:45.760 you mean letting an adult human being
02:09:48.000 talk right I think that's not only
02:09:50.159 allowed I think that's the law not only
02:09:52.800 that I think it's important for us it's
02:09:54.559 even important to talk to people that
02:09:56.639 are completely different than you that
02:09:59.119 don't agree with you at all well it's
02:10:01.159 especially important otherwise it's just
02:10:03.400 masturbatory it's it's interesting it's
02:10:05.159 just you alone getting yourself off but
02:10:06.960 it's also interesting to know why these
02:10:08.520 people think the way they think and I
02:10:11.000 and also there's so many people that if
02:10:13.480 you talk to them online you'd have these
02:10:15.079 horrible conversations but if you sit
02:10:17.000 down with them as an actual human being
02:10:18.639 and treat them with respect and
02:10:20.599 consideration you talk to them like a
02:10:22.639 human being and you just try to be as
02:10:24.760 friendly and open possible as possible
02:10:27.119 despite what your differences might be
02:10:29.599 you realize most people have a lot in
02:10:31.480 common a lot more way more in common
02:10:34.199 than they don't but that's the secret
02:10:35.480 that they're trying to hide yeah so mind
02:10:37.880 control you know the end stage of Mind
02:10:40.280 Control is censorship right but it
02:10:42.440 begins long before that and it begins by
02:10:44.760 creating false categories that wall off
02:10:47.960 your willingness that prevent you from
02:10:50.559 wanting to know certain things or talk
02:10:52.760 to certain people and name calling is a
02:10:55.079 the most obvious tool like he's a crank
02:10:57.000 he's a racist he's a whatever fill it in
02:10:59.880 and then you're like I can't listen to
02:11:01.520 that person and I have to say your
02:11:04.840 willingness to platform or to have a
02:11:07.960 conversation with Alex
02:11:09.559 Jones I think was a revolutionary act
02:11:12.400 actually not that everything Alex Jones
02:11:14.320 says is right it's not not everything I
02:11:16.760 say is right or anyone says is right but
02:11:19.119 Alex Jones is an interesting person
02:11:21.760 and even if he's not interesting he has
02:11:23.400 been walled off from the rest of us yeah
02:11:25.440 through name calling and your
02:11:27.119 willingness to be like no actually we're
02:11:28.760 just going to listen Alex Jones and you
02:11:30.000 can decide for yourself well Alex has
02:11:31.760 been my friend for more than 20 years
02:11:33.639 well I well exactly
02:11:35.800 but even if he just the yeah but I'm
02:11:38.520 sure you have other friends you haven't
02:11:39.800 invited and just like you were not
02:11:41.480 allowed to talk to him and when you hear
02:11:43.320 Alex Jones talk you may not agree with
02:11:45.639 everything he says I don't know that I
02:11:47.320 do but you definitely understand why
02:11:49.880 they told you you couldn't listen to
02:11:50.920 Alex J well that's one of the reasons
02:11:52.599 why I had him as one of the first guests
02:11:54.119 when I came over to Spotify love that I
02:11:56.000 was like let's go what did they say well
02:11:59.400 a lot of people weren't happy we lost
02:12:00.920 sponsors it was it was an
02:12:03.239 issue um but I think it it did the the
02:12:06.800 job you know it it regardless of what he
02:12:11.840 said that's incorrect clearly the Sandy
02:12:13.840 Hook thing was incorrect you know Alex I
02:12:16.440 know Alex personally so I know what he
02:12:18.480 was going through and you know everybody
02:12:20.599 wants to talk about mental health and
02:12:22.639 they want to um praise people for being
02:12:25.520 honest about their mental health issues
02:12:27.480 and support them on their mental health
02:12:29.520 journey to Wellness Alex has gone
02:12:31.760 through some real issues and one of the
02:12:34.159 reasons why he's gone through some
02:12:35.400 issues is because that guy is uncovering
02:12:37.840 real [ __ ] that's terrifying every
02:12:39.880 [ __ ] day and he was drinking out of
02:12:42.199 control and you know he's just [ __ ]
02:12:44.719 constantly stressed freaking out and
02:12:48.079 when you see so many lies and and so
02:12:51.960 much propaganda and and so many scops
02:12:55.440 that are being done on people you start
02:12:57.960 seeing them where they don't exist and
02:12:59.679 that's what he did well and he's also um
02:13:02.800 channeling some stuff there's you can't
02:13:05.840 call
02:13:07.000 911 in detail because you're super
02:13:10.119 informed before the fact he called it he
02:13:13.159 literally called it in the summer of
02:13:14.880 2001 he said planes will fly into the
02:13:17.280 World Trade Centers and they will blame
02:13:18.639 a man called Osama Bin Laden we know
02:13:20.480 that he said that cuz he he said it on
02:13:21.599 tape multiple times and then he said
02:13:23.480 call the White House and tell them this
02:13:25.199 now let's just that's all we know about
02:13:27.159 Alex Jones let's just say that's the
02:13:28.360 fact set how'd that happen right how did
02:13:31.159 he do that no he's channeling something
02:13:34.559 that's super yeah of course yeah there's
02:13:36.679 like no other I mean tell me how he did
02:13:38.639 it otherwise I've asked him about it how
02:13:40.559 did you do that at length he had dinner
02:13:42.440 in my barn recently we're talking about
02:13:43.880 this how did you do that I don't know it
02:13:46.719 just came to me and that's real that is
02:13:50.440 real the super superal is real and I
02:13:52.480 don't know why it's so hard for for the
02:13:55.239 modern mind guess cuz it's a materialist
02:13:56.960 mind to accept that but what you see and
02:13:59.840 that's not a new phenomenon that's
02:14:01.239 happened throughout history there were
02:14:02.320 people called prophets and there are
02:14:04.239 people who were prophets who weren't
02:14:05.360 called prophets but there are people who
02:14:07.880 have information or parts of information
02:14:11.119 bits of information visions of
02:14:12.880 information come to them and then they
02:14:14.079 relay it it's not from them they
02:14:16.679 received it this is like the you know
02:14:18.880 one of the oldest phenomenon in human in
02:14:21.719 human history so those people tend to
02:14:25.599 be a little crazy a little imbalanced a
02:14:28.159 little different from everybody else do
02:14:30.199 you know what I mean they live on Locust
02:14:31.480 and honey in the in the wilderness I
02:14:33.159 mean that's just like that's they're not
02:14:34.920 like everybody else and that's clearly
02:14:38.280 part of what I'm not saying that
02:14:39.400 everything that Alex Jones says is a
02:14:41.040 prophecy from God it's not but that was
02:14:44.400 prophetic there's and if it wasn't tell
02:14:46.159 me how it wasn't in in July of 2000 like
02:14:50.840 I lived in Washington in July of 2001
02:14:54.000 you know my dad worked in the government
02:14:55.480 like I was as well informed as anybody
02:14:57.320 could be about what was going on in the
02:14:58.840 government I've always been interested
02:14:59.920 in what's happening in other countries I
02:15:01.760 was aware of Assam Bin Laden I knew
02:15:03.119 about the Taliban I knew you know more
02:15:04.599 than most people there's not one person
02:15:07.639 who was saying not one person in
02:15:09.239 Washington DC was saying you know at
02:15:10.639 some point soon they may fly airplanes
02:15:12.800 into the World Trade Centers and blame
02:15:15.079 oam Bin Laden like that just wasn't a
02:15:16.800 thing so if you said that multiple times
02:15:19.239 on camera there 's a reason like and and
02:15:23.400 everyone I've said this to 50 people
02:15:24.920 what I just said to you and they all
02:15:25.960 look at me
02:15:27.199 like yeah that's stupid tell me how it's
02:15:29.679 stupid like tell me how he did that like
02:15:32.480 that's that's impossible actually he
02:15:33.920 didn't just do it with that either no
02:15:35.559 I'm aware he's done it with a lot of
02:15:37.199 things and that's one of the more
02:15:40.040 interesting things about him is that
02:15:41.920 like he he talks about Stu like he
02:15:44.840 talked about like I'm going to send this
02:15:46.760 to Jamie cuz this is one of the really
02:15:49.760 crazy ones that he he called and this is
02:15:52.520 like 2000 um 2000
02:15:58.480 probably I guess
02:16:06.320 2017 here it is let me find this give me
02:16:09.599 a second here I find because I I sent it
02:16:11.840 to him like how the [ __ ] did you call
02:16:13.599 this because it's it's one of those ones
02:16:16.320 where you're like this is exactly what's
02:16:18.719 happening now
02:16:22.000 here it is here 2017 hold on a second
02:16:25.920 I'll send you this
02:16:29.480 Jamie come
02:16:31.359 on technology let's
02:16:35.478 go all right I sent it to you
02:16:38.280 Jamie so this is some guy's Instagram
02:16:40.959 clip that I found that took a clip from
02:16:43.318 the podcast and he's doing commentary
02:16:44.920 over put these on things on real quick
02:16:54.200 you got it yeah okay
02:17:02.318 cool here we go 22 years on podcast
02:17:06.318 Infowars Alex Jones and Joe Rogan
02:17:09.760 discuss what's currently happening right
02:17:12.120 now Google CERN technology vampires
02:17:16.679 aliens in a nutshell Alex was pretty on
02:17:20.318 point with this man message let me know
02:17:21.959 what your thoughts are is he crazy or is
02:17:24.000 he on to something it's really big so
02:17:27.478 okay um yeah pour another shot of that
02:17:31.040 get this out
02:17:32.478 proper all right let me give you my best
02:17:35.558 deep research Proclamation once you what
02:17:37.359 do you think is going but am I wrong to
02:17:40.280 still hold out hope that aliens are real
02:17:42.200 because I tell you as one the two guilty
02:17:44.439 pleasures that I still cling to is
02:17:46.760 Bigfoot and Aliens those are two Bigfoot
02:17:49.200 not so much I wish it was real but I
02:17:51.120 just don't are you ready yes Bigfoot
02:17:53.478 real no come on Daddy no are you ready
02:17:58.080 yes I'm going to give you the big out of
02:17:59.439 Joe there are aliens in this room right
02:18:01.120 now for real yeah you're not of this
02:18:02.920 world bro me you're the alien oh wow I
02:18:05.679 didn't know well here's what the elite
02:18:07.959 believe and let me be very clear asz the
02:18:09.599 media I'll take this out of context I
02:18:11.080 only go with what I can prove oh thank
02:18:12.840 you and people can't even handle that
02:18:14.478 there's armies we're fighting a
02:18:15.920 pedophile conspiracy but beyond that
02:18:17.920 it's a vampire conspiracy in that they
02:18:20.200 are interdimensionally sucking the
02:18:22.638 essence of our youth right and they
02:18:24.920 believe they're possessed by an offworld
02:18:26.718 entity they do yeah and Joe I've been on
02:18:29.718 air 22 years I don't get into aliens
02:18:32.160 metaphysical religion any of that I've
02:18:34.160 studied the elite and I've also
02:18:36.000 communicated with a lot of the top
02:18:37.120 people and and if you want to know I
02:18:39.240 will actually break down right now the
02:18:41.120 best knowledge right now what's
02:18:42.599 happening on the planet what's
02:18:44.398 happening the elite are all about
02:18:46.638 Transcendence and living forever and the
02:18:48.478 secrets of the universe and they want to
02:18:50.040 know all this are good some are bad some
02:18:51.840 are a mix but the good ones don't ever
02:18:54.318 want to organize the bad ones didn't
02:18:56.318 want to organize because they lost after
02:18:57.679 power powerful consciousnesses don't
02:19:00.359 want to dominate other people they want
02:19:01.959 to empower them so they don't tend to
02:19:03.240 get together until things are really
02:19:05.000 late in the game then they come together
02:19:06.519 Evil's always defeated because good is
02:19:08.280 so much stronger and we're on this
02:19:10.840 planet and Einstein's physics shut it
02:19:12.679 Max Plank's physics shut it all there's
02:19:14.200 at least 12 dimensions and now that's
02:19:16.160 why all the top scientists and
02:19:17.359 billionaires are coming out saying it's
02:19:18.840 a false hologram it is artificial the
02:19:21.638 computers are scanning it and finding
02:19:24.000 tension points where it's artificially
02:19:25.760 projected and gravity's bleeding in to
02:19:29.280 this universe that's what they call Dark
02:19:31.359 Matter so we're like a thought or a
02:19:33.760 dream that's a wisp in some computer
02:19:36.679 program some God's mind whatever they're
02:19:38.799 proving it all it's all coming out now
02:19:41.760 there's like this sub transmission Zone
02:19:44.040 below the third dimension that's just
02:19:46.000 turned over the most horrible things is
02:19:47.519 what it resonates to and it's trying to
02:19:49.560 get up into the Third di menion that's
02:19:51.520 just a basic level Consciousness to
02:19:53.680 launch into the next levels and our
02:19:56.200 species is already way up at the fifth
02:19:57.800 sixth Dimension consciously our best
02:19:59.880 people but there's this big war trying
02:20:01.920 to like basically destroy Humanity
02:20:04.399 because Humanity has Free Will and
02:20:06.240 there's a decision to which level we
02:20:08.359 want to go to we have free will so
02:20:10.120 Evil's allowed to come and contend not
02:20:11.800 just good and the elites
02:20:14.920 themselves believe they're racing using
02:20:18.520 human technology to try to take our back
02:20:20.920 minds and build some type of breakaway
02:20:23.600 civilization where they're going to
02:20:25.200 merge with machines transcend and break
02:20:28.000 away from the fail species that is man
02:20:30.240 which is kind of like a false
02:20:31.319 transmission because they're thinking
02:20:32.600 what they are is ugly and bad projecting
02:20:34.800 it onto themselves instead of believing
02:20:36.560 no it's a human test about building us
02:20:38.920 up and so Google was set up 18 19 years
02:20:42.200 ago this was I knew about this before it
02:20:43.479 was Declassified I'm just saying I've
02:20:44.800 good sources that they wanted to build a
02:20:47.080 giant artificial system and Google
02:20:50.000 believes that the the first artificial
02:20:51.520 intelligence will be a supercomputer
02:20:54.600 based on the neuron activities of the
02:20:57.439 hive mind of humanity with billions of
02:20:59.880 people wired into it with the internet
02:21:01.439 of things and so all of our thoughts go
02:21:03.600 into it and we're actually building a
02:21:05.359 computer that has real neurons in real
02:21:07.399 time that's also psychically connected
02:21:09.600 to us that are organic creatures so that
02:21:13.240 they will have current prediction Powers
02:21:15.920 future prediction Powers a true Crystal
02:21:18.120 Ball but the big secret is once you have
02:21:20.960 a crystal ball and know the future you
02:21:22.800 can add stimuli beforehand and make
02:21:24.760 decisions that control the future and so
02:21:27.640 then it's the end of Consciousness and
02:21:29.600 Free Will for individuals as we know and
02:21:31.960 a true 2.0 in a very bad way hi mind
02:21:35.640 Consciousness with an AI jacked into
02:21:37.800 everyone knowing our hopes and dreams
02:21:39.800 delivering it to us not in some PKD
02:21:42.120 wirehead system where we plug in and
02:21:44.120 give up on Consciousness because of
02:21:45.560 unlimited pleasure but because we were
02:21:47.040 already wired in and absorbed before we
02:21:49.080 knew it by giving over our conscious
02:21:51.080 to this system by our daily decisions
02:21:53.000 that it was able to manipulate and
02:21:54.280 control into a larger system there's now
02:21:56.560 a human Counterstrike taking place to
02:21:59.160 shut this off before it gets fully into
02:22:01.000 place and to block these systems and to
02:22:03.240 try to have an actual debate about where
02:22:04.880 Humanity goes and cut off the pedophiles
02:22:07.680 and psychic vampires that are control of
02:22:09.960 this AI system before humanity is
02:22:11.840 destroyed of AI how' they get how' the
02:22:14.040 pedophile is that it yeah it's pretty
02:22:16.200 much
02:22:16.750 [Laughter]
02:22:18.960 it it's incredible
02:22:21.359 it's I understand about that was seven
02:22:23.960 years ago years ago yeah okay so no
02:22:27.240 seven years ago no one was thinking AI
02:22:29.080 was going to take over Civ you can see
02:22:31.040 why the FBI decided to destroy him which
02:22:33.319 it did um the people in I mean it's just
02:22:36.359 like what has happened to Alex Jones is
02:22:39.960 proof that at least some of what he's
02:22:41.319 saying is true because what why who is
02:22:43.760 Alex Jones a threat to did you see that
02:22:45.880 interview with the guy from FBI was
02:22:48.439 trying to hook up with that dude on a
02:22:49.680 date CIA yeah was it CIA that's right
02:22:52.439 and they they were talking about how
02:22:54.920 they can destroy a person yeah I think I
02:22:57.399 was mentioning there too were you I was
02:22:59.920 um yeah I mean there are a couple okay
02:23:02.640 so yeah again I don't the third
02:23:05.720 dimension I don't unknow anything about
02:23:07.280 Dimensions okay so I can't comment on
02:23:09.000 that but two things he said um are true
02:23:12.560 one um is that every civilization every
02:23:16.040 religion the Greek myths you know every
02:23:17.880 single one including Judaism
02:23:19.760 Christianity
02:23:21.279 Hinduism uh has believed that there
02:23:24.960 is sort
02:23:26.920 of that the spirit
02:23:29.080 world and Humanity are like that there's
02:23:33.040 you know they're hybrids yeah okay so
02:23:35.200 that's just a fact Genesis 6 um so you
02:23:40.520 know I don't think that's crazy at all
02:23:42.680 uh given that it has been the belief of
02:23:45.439 civilizations that had no contact with
02:23:46.960 each other I don't think it's crazy and
02:23:48.720 I also don't think it's crazy to cons
02:23:50.560 considerate I don't think we have a real
02:23:53.560 map of reality well we definitely don't
02:23:57.240 and I exact better put than I than I
02:24:00.399 explained that's exactly right we don't
02:24:01.800 have a real map and it's not crazy to
02:24:03.319 consider it and it was a very it was an
02:24:05.240 entirely conventional view up until
02:24:07.200 fairly recently um that yeah that this
02:24:11.240 the spirit world like I hate want don't
02:24:13.560 face breeds with people but that is that
02:24:15.240 everyone thought that okay right and
02:24:16.720 even the term spirit world is probably a
02:24:19.319 loaded term of course they're all Lo
02:24:21.479 terms how do you say it in a way that
02:24:23.200 doesn't sound crazy but the whole thing
02:24:24.640 sounds crazy because we don't
02:24:25.560 acknowledge the reality the actual
02:24:27.160 physical reality of the Supernatural and
02:24:28.720 it Israel that's the first thing the
02:24:31.040 second Point that's obviously true is
02:24:33.840 that people uh weak people which is a
02:24:37.560 synonym for bad people come together for
02:24:40.439 strength and safety they act as one the
02:24:43.279 hive mind is a is specific to a certain
02:24:45.720 group of people bad people and that good
02:24:49.479 people don't to come together but
02:24:51.880 they're coming together now and I just
02:24:53.720 not I just noticed this I mean people
02:24:56.800 independently who I know or sort of know
02:24:59.160 in many cases have long despised have
02:25:01.000 come to exactly the same conclusions
02:25:02.880 without talking to each other MH I know
02:25:05.240 that you have this experience all the
02:25:06.479 time yeah it's like I can't believe you
02:25:08.840 think that how did you wind up thinking
02:25:10.399 that right and not just on a specific
02:25:12.720 issue like foreign policy or covid or
02:25:15.680 whatever but like on a whole bunch of
02:25:17.160 different things they're all coming to
02:25:18.080 the same conclusion and they're coming
02:25:19.279 together and so that does
02:25:22.359 suggest you know uh big a big change and
02:25:26.439 a battle I mean it is a battle between
02:25:28.040 good and evil I'm not always convinced
02:25:29.560 I'm on the good side I've been you know
02:25:31.840 an instrument of evil many times in my
02:25:33.319 life and I'm ashamed of it but are you
02:25:35.359 talking about the Iraq War yeah the Iraq
02:25:37.040 War I've been cruel to people probably
02:25:40.200 even already on your show in ways that
02:25:42.040 are unjustified that's my instinct to do
02:25:44.920 that that's a fault not you know not
02:25:49.120 something to brag about it's something
02:25:50.359 ashamed of so I'm not I'm not saying I'm
02:25:51.880 always on the right side I certainly
02:25:52.960 have not always been on the right side
02:25:53.960 I've been on the wrong side many many
02:25:55.160 times but that doesn't change the fact
02:25:58.319 that there is good there is evil they
02:26:00.040 are at war with each other and we
02:26:02.600 are subject to the effects of that
02:26:05.240 conflict and that we're seeing it
02:26:06.840 suddenly play out in ways that are
02:26:08.479 really really obvious there's no
02:26:09.760 political explanation for the trans
02:26:11.520 phenomenon nobody benefits you can say I
02:26:14.720 hear these see these right Wingers be
02:26:16.279 like really it's all about the people
02:26:17.560 who make synthetic hormones they benit
02:26:19.279 yeah okay they benefit it's not driving
02:26:20.840 it that's stupid it's not about the
02:26:22.160 money actually there's no upside it's
02:26:24.399 not helping the kids at all if a child
02:26:27.479 has anorexia which is pretty common
02:26:29.279 actually in this country and the child
02:26:31.600 thinks she's fat you don't say to the
02:26:33.880 child yeah you're
02:26:35.120 fat you you don't do that you give the
02:26:38.000 child help if you can it's hard to treat
02:26:40.000 but you you try if a child comes to you
02:26:42.359 and says actually I think I was born in
02:26:43.800 the wrong body the last thing you do is
02:26:45.160 affirm that it's hurting the child like
02:26:46.640 why would you do that if you love the
02:26:47.920 child you wouldn't do that it's really
02:26:49.720 an EXC excise undertaken for the sake of
02:26:53.520 Destruction the sake of hurting someone
02:26:56.640 there's no real upside what's another
02:26:59.399 phrase description of that it's evil and
02:27:02.960 um you see that a lot a lot yeah and
02:27:07.880 um why like what is that what is it and
02:27:12.200 why is it so obvious to a completely
02:27:14.920 even a completely secular person like me
02:27:16.920 all of a sudden um there's a reason for
02:27:19.399 that we're watch you know history is
02:27:20.760 moving really really fast we're right in
02:27:22.200 the middle of it and I probably wouldn't
02:27:26.000 have chosen to be born at the time I was
02:27:27.800 I'd much rather sort of reach maturity
02:27:29.399 in 1955 really you know well I don't
02:27:32.479 know I don't get to choose you know I
02:27:33.960 don't like drama I don't like change
02:27:35.640 like I'm there was drama and change back
02:27:37.439 then there there was but it people
02:27:39.560 didn't rec well there was a cold war of
02:27:41.439 course there was a Korean War okay but
02:27:43.520 people didn't see it in their face right
02:27:47.000 in the way I don't think would you
02:27:48.479 rather know
02:27:50.439 but I don't have a choice I do know yeah
02:27:51.920 I'd rather know I'd rather be right now
02:27:54.960 yeah well you've got a much better
02:27:56.520 attitude than I I mean sometimes I just
02:27:58.240 my parents got divorced when I was
02:27:59.279 little and so I kind of like I don't
02:28:01.439 want change yeah I know to me I know
02:28:04.439 what you mean um you know um I was
02:28:07.520 having a conversation in the green room
02:28:09.240 with the club the other night about this
02:28:11.880 uh guy from Canada that's uh HIV
02:28:15.479 positive that's a
02:28:17.160 transom that's taking hormones so they
02:28:20.399 can breastfeed their 9-month-old
02:28:22.399 daughter so a biological male is taking
02:28:25.439 hormones and is now breastfeeding their
02:28:28.200 daughter off of their male tit and I
02:28:30.640 said if I was Satan if Satan was real I
02:28:33.080 would do that exactly if I was if
02:28:35.080 Satan's real I would I mean if Satan was
02:28:38.600 going to do something Insidious and and
02:28:41.800 unbelievably creepy he would do that
02:28:44.960 well I think he is doing that obviously
02:28:46.760 but this guy's a a real freak well but
02:28:49.600 right
02:28:50.920 using public money too but he's a victim
02:28:53.160 too I mean the thing about right because
02:28:55.359 the thing about evil the reason that
02:28:57.760 evil is distinct from everything else it
02:28:59.880 destroys the vessel it's held in the
02:29:02.520 conduit through which it flows destroys
02:29:04.040 the person so like that guy in the end
02:29:08.240 will not Thrive right he'll be destroyed
02:29:11.080 too and so that's how you know that it's
02:29:14.359 supernatural in other words if I you
02:29:16.960 know if I steal your iPhone and sell it
02:29:18.840 and I get an extra 400
02:29:20.600 like that's kind of explicable you
02:29:22.319 understand why I'm doing that I want the
02:29:23.359 400 bucks right but if I'm encouraging
02:29:26.040 your kid to castrate himself I'm not
02:29:29.720 really benefiting from that actually
02:29:31.160 there's no material benefit to me at all
02:29:32.680 there's no real psychic benefit it's
02:29:35.040 it's hurting for its own sake and um and
02:29:38.439 that's evil that's there's no political
02:29:39.880 category that explains that right and
02:29:41.640 then there's clearly money involved in
02:29:43.359 that too there is money of there's the
02:29:44.880 gender affirming clinics that have
02:29:46.720 popped up all over the country since
02:29:48.279 2007 you see the map of it's [ __ ]
02:29:50.840 bananas but why would you want to do
02:29:53.080 that that's why would policy makers want
02:29:54.960 to do that why would anybody want to
02:29:56.279 make money that way right why would they
02:29:57.760 Cho to make Mone people it's the most
02:29:59.319 unnatural thing ever because parents
02:30:01.800 every parent at a certain age feels is
02:30:03.160 like I I like my kids I want grandkids
02:30:05.560 you want to protect your children to
02:30:07.040 continue yeah from bad decision so I
02:30:08.680 always think the politicians who push
02:30:10.880 trism on the country like their kids are
02:30:12.960 going trans too yeah they are right
02:30:15.640 they're not escaping it it's like
02:30:17.080 they're burning down their own house I
02:30:18.760 would like to see the statistic of
02:30:20.240 people in Hollywood like how many of
02:30:22.240 their kids turn trans versus the rest of
02:30:24.840 the world yeah I know some of them too
02:30:27.120 but how many of them versus the rest of
02:30:29.800 the world well a lot more a lot more
02:30:32.319 which is a a morally corrupt business
02:30:35.040 yes yeah like more than we knew more
02:30:38.120 than I knew you know the entertainment
02:30:40.800 business it's it's always been that way
02:30:42.720 you know Tarantino was talking to us
02:30:44.240 about um this famous old director that
02:30:46.840 had a a bedroom in his office where he
02:30:49.399 would bed the starlets and it was just
02:30:51.200 common knowledge that if you wanted to
02:30:52.439 be in his movie you had to [ __ ] him and
02:30:54.720 you'd go into his office he had a
02:30:55.920 literal bedroom in his office we had
02:30:57.960 some of that in television yes I'm sure
02:31:00.160 yeah quite a bit yeah and I didn't I
02:31:03.359 didn't really understand I didn't you
02:31:05.279 know obviously partake in it or you
02:31:07.640 would know because all my text messages
02:31:09.279 went up in the New York Times so um I'm
02:31:11.520 not hiding any of my own behavior but I
02:31:13.279 mean I I will say if I'm being honest it
02:31:15.560 didn't really register with me I was
02:31:16.720 like yeah that's kind of wild and crazy
02:31:18.160 I just didn't you know like like my wife
02:31:20.399 I didn't want to blow up my family I
02:31:21.520 didn't do anything like that really but
02:31:23.439 I certainly saw a lot like a lot of it
02:31:25.880 like a lot and I just didn't really see
02:31:27.760 it as like horrifying I just saw it as
02:31:30.600 kind of like well you know creative
02:31:31.960 people are this way kind of thing but I
02:31:33.880 look back and I'm like it was really
02:31:35.040 dark well especially the producer thing
02:31:37.920 right that like the Weinstein thing that
02:31:41.040 the the way they ran the business that
02:31:42.960 that's how it was pay to play I worked
02:31:45.640 for Harvey Weinstein for a year did you
02:31:47.439 really yeah I did when 19 99 uh he had a
02:31:51.520 magazine um with Tina Brown called Talk
02:31:54.160 magazine I was the head political writer
02:31:56.600 for it and they had an office at carnegi
02:31:59.640 Towers in New York right below the park
02:32:01.760 and uh and I remember the big con I mean
02:32:03.520 I remember he was a pig I was not like
02:32:05.080 an intimate friend of his or whatever
02:32:06.399 but I certainly dealt with him and the
02:32:08.279 big controversy was he was smoking in
02:32:11.080 elevators and um that was and I've kind
02:32:13.640 of supported that if I'm being honest
02:32:15.160 but um but he was considered incredibly
02:32:17.880 insensitive and just like vulgar a pig
02:32:20.680 well he looks vulgar yeah well that was
02:32:23.000 certainly what everyone thought of him
02:32:24.040 where I worked Harvey's just a pig and
02:32:25.840 his brother Bob was a little bit less
02:32:27.720 that way he was also involved but um but
02:32:30.760 yeah people knew that he was a bad guy
02:32:33.560 but like but he made awesome
02:32:36.120 movies yeah and and also but he was just
02:32:38.600 powerful it's like hary Weinstein like I
02:32:40.319 want to [ __ ] with hary Weinstein I mean
02:32:41.960 I didn't really think about it too much
02:32:43.160 to be completely honest that was just it
02:32:45.439 was just a guy I worked for but um I
02:32:48.399 don't know I didn't I certainly if you'd
02:32:50.520 played that Alex Jones clip for me in
02:32:51.800 1999 I would have been and I did see
02:32:53.800 Alex Jones Clips in 1999 and then in
02:32:56.840 later years where he was talking about
02:32:58.080 building seven and I was very offended I
02:33:01.240 was like outraged that he would be
02:33:03.240 suggesting that there was something
02:33:04.840 about 9/11 that wasn't above board that
02:33:06.880 there were you know things we didn't
02:33:08.000 know that were being hidden from us and
02:33:09.240 I was like mad at Alex Jones for saying
02:33:11.200 that I remember that really well how
02:33:13.160 dare you the building 7 one is wild well
02:33:15.960 it is W it is wild I mean I have no all
02:33:18.160 I know is 20
02:33:20.800 one I don't even know what year it is 23
02:33:23.200 years could it really be 23 years after
02:33:24.800 911 23 years later what's the
02:33:27.240 justification for classifying any
02:33:28.640 document around 911 there's no
02:33:29.880 justification well the same
02:33:30.960 justification of classifying the
02:33:32.200 documents about the Kennedy
02:33:33.200 assassination exactly 61 years later
02:33:35.000 yeah or releasing the covid vaccine data
02:33:37.359 75 years later of course yeah right I
02:33:40.439 mean it's of look secrecy is different
02:33:43.880 from privacy privacy is necessary for
02:33:46.000 the Dignity of this white you've got a
02:33:47.479 door in the bathroom and your bedroom
02:33:48.720 right you know you need privacy you need
02:33:50.279 private thoughts we have no privacy
02:33:51.720 whatsoever none no privacy at all thanks
02:33:54.319 to the to the iPhone and government
02:33:55.760 spying on us all so there's no privacy
02:33:58.000 but there's massive secrecy secrecy is
02:33:59.960 different secrecy of bets lying the only
02:34:01.560 reason to have secrecy is in order to do
02:34:03.600 something that you're ashamed of other
02:34:05.479 people knowing about that's that's
02:34:07.439 immoral and probably illegal and there's
02:34:09.560 more secrecy than ever and that means
02:34:13.040 that there's more lying than ever there
02:34:15.279 are more crimes being committed than
02:34:16.840 ever that's the shest sign of it why are
02:34:18.560 there a billion classified documents in
02:34:20.399 a So-Cal democracy because they're lying
02:34:22.439 to us that's why but 9911 like what is
02:34:25.200 the justification for
02:34:26.840 that I don't know the answer I really
02:34:28.960 don't know the answer but there is one
02:34:31.040 that's for sure yeah it's not methods
02:34:32.720 and sources you think it's methods and
02:34:34.000 sources trying to protect their Saudi
02:34:36.200 sources I don't think so you know the
02:34:39.000 wildest thing about Tower 7 is that if
02:34:42.800 you just say it looks like a controlled
02:34:44.920 demolition people get mad at you why
02:34:47.319 well I don't know because I'm not saying
02:34:49.399 that is a controlled demolition but I'm
02:34:51.520 saying if you watch it it looks like a
02:34:55.279 controlled demolition but that happens
02:34:56.840 all the time buildings Catch Fire and
02:34:58.359 they just implode in on themselves I
02:34:59.760 think happens every week right all these
02:35:02.160 poultry plants and manufacturing plants
02:35:04.160 that keep getting burned uh Through Fire
02:35:07.200 they all like it's the way it went down
02:35:09.319 yeah so I say why do they respond that
02:35:12.479 way and of course I responded that way
02:35:15.279 um so when I think looking back the
02:35:17.960 reason that I did was because because if
02:35:20.120 you call that into question you had to
02:35:22.840 ask a lot of other really obvious
02:35:24.439 questions you didn't want to deal with
02:35:26.160 and you might arrive at the conclusion
02:35:27.600 that a lot of your most basic
02:35:28.680 assumptions are false and that you've
02:35:30.319 been had and it's just too destabilizing
02:35:33.040 maybe right well the real problem with
02:35:34.960 Tower 7 is they go well okay if it was a
02:35:37.960 controled demolition how was that
02:35:39.800 engineered did they just decide to do
02:35:41.880 that before September 11th and you know
02:35:43.960 how long it would take to rig a building
02:35:45.359 like that right or was it built into the
02:35:47.800 building and how would they know would
02:35:49.840 even work and how would they do
02:35:51.000 something like that and how would there
02:35:52.160 not be a record of it being built into
02:35:54.359 the building like for someone to
02:35:56.760 engineer and where's the sound signature
02:35:59.279 on the on the tape there would be a
02:36:00.680 sound of the explosions going which is a
02:36:03.200 fair question yeah a lot of fair
02:36:04.960 questions and has there ever been a
02:36:06.960 building that experienced a tremendous
02:36:09.040 amount of damage because two enormous
02:36:11.319 skyscrapers fell right next to it
02:36:14.359 damaged it and then massive fire started
02:36:16.920 and then there's diesel generators that
02:36:18.960 are in the base so they have all this
02:36:20.960 fuel so they have this incredible
02:36:22.800 Inferno in the basement that weakens the
02:36:24.840 structure and is that why it collapsed
02:36:27.200 maybe to totally possible um a lot of
02:36:29.920 building Engineers disagree with that as
02:36:31.680 you know yeah and um they don't think
02:36:35.560 that could have happened uh in the way
02:36:37.560 you just described I'm agnostic on it
02:36:40.120 what I because I don't know the answer
02:36:41.840 and I have no way of knowing all I know
02:36:44.240 is that there's no justification for
02:36:45.800 keeping those documents secret that I
02:36:47.680 can think of and if there is tell tell
02:36:49.960 us what it is no one has bothered cuz
02:36:52.200 nobody presses and it's you know I'll
02:36:54.920 add that to the list of outrages yeah
02:36:57.120 you know what I mean and then it it
02:36:58.520 gives you this feeling of helplessness
02:37:00.439 because there's so many of those they
02:37:01.880 just pile on there's always another one
02:37:03.880 there government spied on me broke into
02:37:06.000 my phone and spied on me and I couldn't
02:37:07.680 get a straight answer to that and I'm
02:37:09.880 I'm not a felon and I'm well not only
02:37:11.760 that they used they got into your signal
02:37:13.439 account right yeah and then they leaked
02:37:15.000 it to the New York Times what they found
02:37:16.960 there so it's one thing to say okay we
02:37:20.000 picked up your text exchanges with a
02:37:22.800 foreign National which is
02:37:24.479 true um I text a lot of foreign
02:37:27.000 Nationals because of my job like why
02:37:28.560 wouldn't I and it's my right as far as
02:37:29.920 I'm concerned that's not illegal but we
02:37:32.399 picked up your text exchanges which I
02:37:34.840 think itself is a lie I think they were
02:37:36.359 targeting me I think they are now um I
02:37:38.960 know I'm pretty positive they are but
02:37:40.760 whatever leaving that aside we spied on
02:37:43.600 you we think we have justification is
02:37:45.760 there a justification for leaking the
02:37:47.279 contents of my private conversation to a
02:37:49.000 news outl in order to discredit me no
02:37:50.880 there's no that's secret police [ __ ]
02:37:52.520 okay yeah I'm not whining I'm a victim
02:37:54.960 I'm certainly not a victim but what was
02:37:56.880 infuriating was my to and I got members
02:37:59.399 of Congress involved because I was
02:38:00.640 pissed and I felt
02:38:02.160 threatened I couldn't get a straight
02:38:04.080 answer they were just like we're not
02:38:05.200 answering those questions and what are
02:38:06.200 you going to do about it [ __ ] what are
02:38:08.359 you g to do about
02:38:09.479 it you know I don't I don't possess a
02:38:11.479 drone Fleet there's nothing I can do
02:38:12.800 about it actually that's the truth so
02:38:15.000 when the system breaks down and things
02:38:17.479 like I don't know honesty
02:38:20.200 Justice the laww none of those apply the
02:38:22.800 people in charge decide that doesn't
02:38:24.160 apply to me you are literally
02:38:27.520 powerless and um bizarre that the New
02:38:30.279 York Times wouldn't have an issue with
02:38:31.680 that well the New York Times does that
02:38:33.560 all the time but but but bizarre they
02:38:35.600 wouldn't have an issue with the
02:38:36.640 government tapping into your phone they
02:38:38.520 work for the government are you kidding
02:38:40.160 the New York Times yeah the New York
02:38:42.000 Times is a conduit for the lies of
02:38:44.479 government that's what it is it's their
02:38:46.600 tool and they're perfectly aware of that
02:38:49.960 I mean I used to write for the New York
02:38:51.319 Times as a freelancer I mean I've been
02:38:52.640 around the New York Times a lot and
02:38:54.640 there uh yeah there are a lot of really
02:38:56.200 smart people there for sure even now I
02:38:58.319 would less so now but there's still I
02:39:00.240 think smart people there there are I
02:39:01.760 know some and they know but they think
02:39:05.600 that that you know it's worth it because
02:39:07.359 they're bringing information I don't
02:39:08.680 know what they think actually but no
02:39:11.080 they're they're
02:39:12.399 tools of power and that's like the one
02:39:15.200 thing that you're not allowed to be even
02:39:16.479 if you think the power is good like
02:39:17.640 maybe they all support the agenda of the
02:39:19.399 US Government destabilizing the world
02:39:21.640 and impoverishing their own population
02:39:23.200 maybe they're on board with
02:39:24.880 that even if they are they shouldn't do
02:39:27.080 it because the job of the media the
02:39:30.120 Press is to keep power in check you are
02:39:35.960 kind of like the seat belt right you
02:39:38.439 know you make sure
02:39:40.720 that things don't go too far so um and
02:39:44.560 they're not doing that they're acting as
02:39:46.200 a willing handmaiden when do you think
02:39:47.760 that switched I think it's been the case
02:39:50.200 for a long time I mean if you look at
02:39:52.040 what happened to Richard Nixon which I
02:39:53.439 of course did not understand at all um
02:39:56.279 Richard Nixon was taken out by the FBI
02:39:58.880 and CIA and um with the help of Bob Bob
02:40:03.600 Woodward who was a Washington Post
02:40:05.160 reporter who had been a naval
02:40:07.040 intelligence officer working in the
02:40:09.880 White House working in the Nixon White
02:40:12.080 House and then he shows up like a year
02:40:16.439 later and he's this brand new reporter
02:40:19.439 never been a journalist at all he's a
02:40:21.279 naval Intel officer the famous Bob
02:40:23.840 Woodward we all
02:40:25.279 rever and he's at the Washington Post
02:40:27.479 and somehow he gets the biggest story in
02:40:29.760 the history of the Washington Post he's
02:40:31.160 the lead guy in that story well I I
02:40:33.479 worked at a newspaper I've been in the
02:40:34.680 news business my whole life that is not
02:40:36.680 how it works you don't take a kid like
02:40:38.399 his first day from a totally unrelated
02:40:41.040 business and put him on the biggest
02:40:42.600 story but he was he was that guy and who
02:40:46.240 is his main source for water date oh the
02:40:48.160 number two guy at the FBI
02:40:50.760 oh so you have the naval intelligence
02:40:53.080 officer working with the
02:40:54.680 FBI official to destroy the president
02:40:59.160 okay so that's a deep State coup what
02:41:01.279 else how would you describe that if that
02:41:02.680 happened in Guatemala what would you say
02:41:05.359 and yet the way it was framed in the way
02:41:06.920 that I accepted for decades was oh this
02:41:09.439 Intrepid reporter fought power no no no
02:41:12.200 this Intrepid reporter Bob Woodward was
02:41:14.720 a tool of power secret power which is
02:41:16.840 the most threatening kind to
02:41:19.840 bounce the single most popular president
02:41:22.520 in American History Richard Nixon from
02:41:24.760 office before the end of his term and
02:41:26.720 replace him with who oh Gerald Ford who
02:41:29.880 sat on the Warren Commission Now how did
02:41:32.439 Gerald Ford get to be Richard Nixon's
02:41:34.520 Vice President well because Carl Albert
02:41:37.439 the Democrat Speaker of the House told
02:41:39.439 him you must choose him we will only
02:41:41.279 confirm him when they sent the actual
02:41:44.399 elected vice president away for tax
02:41:47.000 evasion SPO agnu of Maryland
02:41:49.840 so you have a complete setup like an ABS
02:41:52.399 Gerald Ford the only unelected president
02:41:54.640 in American history actually sat on the
02:41:56.120 Warren Commission something else that I
02:41:58.560 accepted at face value until I looked at
02:42:00.120 it I was like that's completely insane
02:42:01.800 you didn't want to interview Jack Ruby
02:42:03.200 in your investigation of the
02:42:05.080 assassination okay you're fake yeah he
02:42:07.720 was on the warrant commission and so uh
02:42:11.040 sorry for the long story but the point
02:42:12.439 is like that that happened in front of
02:42:14.439 all of us but the way it was framed
02:42:16.680 cloaked the obvious reality of it the
02:42:18.880 people broke into the Watergate office
02:42:20.600 building from which the name is taken
02:42:23.479 Watergate was I think it was six of them
02:42:25.760 or seven of them all but one was a CIA
02:42:29.120 employee that that's real it's like look
02:42:31.319 it up on Google so the whole thing
02:42:34.760 Richard Nixon was elected by more votes
02:42:38.240 than any president in American history
02:42:40.600 in the 1972 election he was the most
02:42:43.560 popular by votes which is the only way
02:42:45.080 we can really measure popularity the
02:42:46.279 most popular
02:42:47.680 president in his election campaign and
02:42:50.120 two years later he's gone undone by a
02:42:53.160 naval Intel officer the number two guy
02:42:55.160 at the FBI and a bunch of CIA employees
02:42:57.960 you tell me what that is those are the
02:43:00.760 facts those are not disputed facts
02:43:02.160 that's not crackpot [ __ ] that's just
02:43:04.479 look it up so why did they want to get
02:43:06.640 rid of
02:43:09.200 Nixon um you know there are a lot of
02:43:11.439 theories on that I mean we don't first
02:43:13.800 of all we don't need to know motive to
02:43:15.920 know what happened they meaning
02:43:18.560 unelected federal employees got rid of
02:43:21.000 Richard Nixon which is the most
02:43:23.399 anti-democratic way to make a leadership
02:43:25.680 change that there is okay I should just
02:43:29.240 say at the outet I actually kind of
02:43:30.240 believe in democracy obviously it's not
02:43:31.640 working well obviously it's ending
02:43:33.560 globally there will never be another
02:43:35.080 liberal democracy unfortunately but I'm
02:43:37.359 attached to it because I was born here I
02:43:38.920 really believe in it and it's better
02:43:40.439 than any other system so that's why I'm
02:43:42.960 pissed what was their
02:43:45.160 motive there are a lot of theories on
02:43:47.240 this there's an amazing convers ation on
02:43:50.080 tape um between Richard Nixon when he
02:43:52.760 was still president I think it was in
02:43:53.800 1973 and I think it was Richard Helms
02:43:56.800 the head of the CIA though I may have
02:43:58.720 [ __ ] that up but it was the head of
02:43:59.920 the CIA I think it was Helms um and
02:44:02.279 Nixon says I know why they killed Jack
02:44:06.439 Kennedy so Nixon was a student of
02:44:08.640 History obviously a flawed and
02:44:10.240 complicated person but a very very smart
02:44:12.880 person and he was really interested in
02:44:15.600 why this guy who'd been president just
02:44:17.399 one president before him was murdered
02:44:20.680 and he didn't think it was a lone gunman
02:44:23.279 who was mysteriously assassinated two
02:44:25.479 days later by another lone gunman like
02:44:27.319 it's so obviously [ __ ] and he knew
02:44:29.680 that and he said to say a director who
02:44:31.640 and you can listen to the tape that's on
02:44:32.800 the internet is totally silent on this
02:44:36.479 question so I think there was the
02:44:39.880 impression I don't think I know that
02:44:41.520 Nixon understood that the bureaucracy
02:44:43.560 was really in control of the country it
02:44:45.200 wasn't elected
02:44:46.439 officials and that's a massive threat
02:44:49.640 um because it's
02:44:51.399 true so and there may have been other
02:44:53.359 reasons too that I'm not privy to look
02:44:55.160 all I and by the way I didn't even know
02:44:57.000 any of this despite having moved to
02:44:59.160 Washington in high school and been
02:45:00.479 around this stuff a lot a lot a lot I
02:45:03.359 didn't know any of and I know Bob
02:45:04.800 Woodward personally so I didn't and I
02:45:06.880 Know Carl Bernstein personally I even
02:45:08.279 work for Carl Bernstein briefly so I I
02:45:10.520 knew some of the actual players in this
02:45:12.439 but I didn't connect the obvious dots
02:45:15.000 because they weren't framed that way
02:45:17.000 that's the point I'm making it's the way
02:45:18.319 that you frame things you can have all
02:45:20.040 the information available on Wikipedia
02:45:23.399 which is also controlled by the Intel
02:45:25.080 agencies but it there's still
02:45:26.279 information on there the information can
02:45:28.479 be out there in the public domain it's a
02:45:31.040 matter of seeing it for what it
02:45:34.359 is right
02:45:36.720 yeah so Nixon said that he knew why they
02:45:40.040 killed JFK MH did he elaborate
02:45:44.120 nope and it's worth listening to it's a
02:45:46.600 very weird conversation that takes place
02:45:48.279 in the oval
02:45:49.680 office which famously had tape recording
02:45:52.439 devices in it obviously this became a
02:45:53.920 big feature during the Watergate
02:45:55.800 hearings um but yes that conversation
02:46:00.200 and I may be mangling it slightly but
02:46:02.040 it's on the internet and absolutely
02:46:03.600 worth listening to and the CIA director
02:46:06.520 has this kind of sinister silence so
02:46:08.359 like if if I'm the president you're the
02:46:10.359 CIA director and I say I know why the
02:46:12.600 guy who is just president 10 years ago
02:46:14.520 was
02:46:15.240 killed the obvious answer would be like
02:46:17.200 well why right why why you what you know
02:46:20.080 why he was killed you've got insight
02:46:21.520 into the assassination of a US president
02:46:24.120 he doesn't say
02:46:25.399 anything is like a very weird response
02:46:28.479 like what just kind of throw that out
02:46:30.600 there like if you say to me you know
02:46:32.080 we're taking a leak you're at the next
02:46:33.120 Journal you're like I figured out the
02:46:34.319 secret to life and I'm like huh
02:46:37.439 okay that's like not a good response
02:46:40.760 right right right it's a telling
02:46:42.920 response did you hear Trump's take on
02:46:44.840 the JFK assassination why he didn't
02:46:46.720 release the files I know it
02:46:49.720 he said that if you knew what I know you
02:46:52.960 wouldn't tell people
02:46:54.720 either which is crazy well that's his
02:46:58.279 position on the UAP thing as well yeah
02:47:01.040 actually um and that's a lot of people's
02:47:04.160 position on it I mean you know Trump is
02:47:06.279 saying of course the CIA had knowledge
02:47:08.680 of it that is
02:47:10.000 known
02:47:11.560 um I
02:47:13.279 mean I mean the whole thing it's like
02:47:16.080 it's so funny there's so many levels and
02:47:18.160 there's so much I don't understand but
02:47:20.120 the whole JFK conspiracy industry and it
02:47:23.960 really is an industry more books written
02:47:25.520 on that than almost any historical topic
02:47:28.399 um is is filled with wackos right there
02:47:30.359 are a lot of wackos in there but it
02:47:32.520 obscures that fact obscures the larger
02:47:35.399 fact which is the facts themselves tell
02:47:37.840 an unbelievable story yeah and so um
02:47:43.000 whatever I could get into it at Great
02:47:44.240 length but yeah um yeah they they're
02:47:46.880 still classifying documents 61 years
02:47:48.800 later both Trump and Joe Biden have in
02:47:53.080 violation of my read of federal law kept
02:47:55.720 those documents secret there's no living
02:47:58.200 person connected to the Kennedy
02:47:59.600 assassination it was a couple
02:48:01.720 Generations ago there's no one person
02:48:04.120 who's whose secrets are being protected
02:48:07.520 it's an institution or maybe countries
02:48:09.680 there may have been countries involved
02:48:10.960 too I mean I don't know the answer but
02:48:13.560 there's clearly something worth
02:48:15.760 protecting and I know that when I I
02:48:17.920 spoke to someone who seen the documents
02:48:20.359 okay two years ago and I got um I got
02:48:24.439 one fact out of them which is yes the
02:48:25.920 CIA was involved and by CIA CIA is a
02:48:28.040 huge organization but James Jesus
02:48:30.920 Angleton the head of the operations
02:48:33.920 directorate had knowledge of this which
02:48:35.960 I think is well known but that that's
02:48:37.640 the view of someone who saw the
02:48:38.680 documents so I thought that was news so
02:48:40.359 I went on TV and said
02:48:42.200 that um the next day I'll never forget
02:48:45.120 it I went quail hunting and I was
02:48:48.080 driving back and I got a phone call from
02:48:51.600 Mike pompeo's lawyer Mike Pompeo was the
02:48:53.800 Secretary of State but before then he
02:48:55.680 was the director of the CIA and in that
02:48:58.359 position he plotted the murder of Julian
02:49:01.000 Assan so he is a criminal as far as I'm
02:49:03.160 concerned but um his lawyer called me
02:49:05.720 and said you know you should know that
02:49:08.160 anyone who tells you the contents of
02:49:11.120 classified documents has committed a
02:49:12.800 crime he's threatening me he in my car
02:49:16.920 I'll never with my dog sitting next to
02:49:18.239 I'll never forget this and I said are
02:49:20.040 you really saying that to reveal that
02:49:22.840 the US government had a role in the
02:49:24.880 murder of a democratically elected
02:49:26.399 president to say that out loud that's
02:49:28.520 the crime what about the actual crime
02:49:30.920 which is murdering a president like
02:49:33.160 you're covering up for that
02:49:35.040 Mike he had no no response at
02:49:38.080 all and so Mike Pompeo is the one who
02:49:42.319 pressed Trump to keep those documents
02:49:45.359 secret and so it's like what's crazy to
02:49:47.239 me is not just that Pompeo did that I
02:49:49.080 think Pompeo is a really Sinister person
02:49:51.239 and a and a criminal I think that I
02:49:52.920 think that because the facts suggest
02:49:54.960 that he was caught Yahoo news Mike
02:49:58.520 isakov wrote a long piece on this
02:49:59.880 several years ago his employees went to
02:50:01.880 Mike iskov and said hey Mike Pompeo is
02:50:04.319 plotting to murder Julian Assange who
02:50:06.680 has never even been charged with a crime
02:50:08.239 in the United States as CI director
02:50:10.520 that's illegal you're not allowed
02:50:11.920 federal employees are not allowed to
02:50:13.399 just kill people they don't like okay
02:50:14.920 just to set the Baseline here so
02:50:19.439 that's who Mike Pompeo is but he somehow
02:50:22.760 intimidated Trump into not releasing
02:50:24.840 this well okay that's all bad right I
02:50:27.040 think it's criminal Behavior what's
02:50:28.960 crazy is how Mike Pompeo is treated he's
02:50:31.680 treated as like a republican Puba in
02:50:34.120 good standing he fully expects to become
02:50:37.479 the secretary of defense in a trump
02:50:39.520 Administration which is like completely
02:50:41.000 insane why would you take a criminal and
02:50:42.239 give him nuclear weapons okay that's my
02:50:43.760 view I think it's a common sense View
02:50:46.120 and like he goes to fundraisers and
02:50:47.600 dinners and everyone's like hey Mike
02:50:48.920 Pompeo it's like no you're the guy who
02:50:52.720 kept information the public has a right
02:50:54.479 to no secret you're the guy who plotted
02:50:56.560 the murder of someone who committed no
02:50:58.200 crime you are the outlaw you are the bad
02:51:00.640 guy but no he's treated as like you know
02:51:03.920 like a pillar of Republican Washington I
02:51:06.080 think that's I think it's mindbending to
02:51:09.040 watch that and by the way you know
02:51:13.160 whatever that's all I'll say by the way
02:51:16.479 no I mean you know people don't say that
02:51:18.080 cuz they're worried getting punished
02:51:19.239 they're worried about someone putting
02:51:20.319 Kitty porn on their computer members of
02:51:22.279 Congress are terrified of the Intel
02:51:24.520 agencies I'm not guessing at that
02:51:26.359 they've told me that including people on
02:51:28.520 the Intel committee including people who
02:51:30.000 run the Intel committee the people whose
02:51:31.960 job it is to oversee and keep in line
02:51:35.399 these enormous secretive agencies whose
02:51:38.399 budgets we can't even know they're black
02:51:40.960 budgets they the parents the agencies
02:51:44.960 are the children they're afraid of the
02:51:48.279 AG gencies that's not compatible with
02:51:51.720 democracy democracy is a really simple
02:51:54.279 system even representative democracy
02:51:55.800 like ours the people rule they do so
02:51:58.279 through elections they express their
02:51:59.560 preference through voting they send
02:52:01.920 their people to the capital city to run
02:52:03.760 the government on their behalf whenever
02:52:05.800 you have unelected people who are not
02:52:08.439 accountable to anyone making the biggest
02:52:10.239 decisions you don't have a democracy you
02:52:12.560 have something else another system I
02:52:14.080 would call it a tyranny or whatever you
02:52:15.359 want to call it it's not a democracy so
02:52:17.160 that's like super obvious it's playing
02:52:18.640 out in front of everyone and no one
02:52:19.680 cares and no one does anything about it
02:52:22.239 and I and I think the reason is because
02:52:24.120 they're threatened and if you look at
02:52:26.080 the committee chairman who allow this
02:52:27.600 [ __ ] to happen year after year they're
02:52:30.279 all and I don't know people say oh
02:52:32.760 they're compromised they're being
02:52:33.800 blackmailed whatever I don't have
02:52:34.840 evidence of that but I know them and
02:52:37.359 they all have things to hide I know that
02:52:39.000 for a fact and so it's not a stretch of
02:52:41.680 imagination to imagine that you know
02:52:44.960 some committee chairman who's allowing
02:52:47.319 warrantless spying on Amer Americans to
02:52:48.960 continue or whatever abuse they're
02:52:50.880 allowing knowing fully or hiding the
02:52:52.880 truth about uaps ignoring the UAP
02:52:54.600 disclosure Act of 2023 like why are they
02:52:57.120 doing that it's not impossible to
02:52:59.120 imagine that some guy with a drinking
02:53:00.600 problem or a weird sex life and that's
02:53:03.080 very common very common up there that's
02:53:05.479 why they're doing it because they don't
02:53:07.040 want to be exposed I don't I don't have
02:53:08.120 evidence of that I don't have proof of
02:53:09.279 that right but that that's not a crazy
02:53:10.920 thing to assume that that could be
02:53:13.479 happening and I said to somebody a very
02:53:16.200 powerful person
02:53:18.560 the other day in a conversation in my
02:53:20.160 kitchen an elected official holds a
02:53:22.319 really senior position a very famous
02:53:23.920 person I was going crazy I was so mad
02:53:25.640 about all this stuff and about the
02:53:27.920 warrantless spying and about the funding
02:53:29.479 for these insane Wars and I said to the
02:53:31.960 guy who serves in one of the legislative
02:53:35.080 bodies like got so mad my dogs were
02:53:37.080 afraid they're like well why are you
02:53:38.279 yelling because I don't yell at home but
02:53:39.920 I was like all these people are
02:53:41.680 controlled they're all you know got
02:53:44.040 weird sex lives and all these things are
02:53:45.720 hiding and they're being blackmailed by
02:53:46.960 the Intel agencies and he said that I'm
02:53:48.600 quoting I
02:53:51.640 know I was like are we okay so at this
02:53:54.640 point we're just sort of we're just sort
02:53:56.640 of admitting that's real like how why do
02:53:58.319 we allow that to continue the having
02:53:59.760 people compromise thing God that's an
02:54:01.720 old story it's the oldest story J G
02:54:04.560 Hoover I mean it's it's it's uh all of
02:54:06.840 them it's Epstein's Island it's
02:54:08.120 everything but look I don't have any I'm
02:54:10.600 telling you I'm What's The Phrase the
02:54:12.640 finance guys use open kimono like I'm
02:54:14.720 actually telling you all I know I don't
02:54:15.680 know anything else right um but I know
02:54:18.800 that the publicly available facts tell a
02:54:20.720 really clear story which is the
02:54:22.800 government is not acting on behalf of
02:54:24.920 the population and so it's inherently
02:54:27.520 illegitimate because its only legitimacy
02:54:30.560 derives from the citizenry the only
02:54:33.160 reason the government can do things that
02:54:34.960 it does kill people collect money by
02:54:36.600 force all the powers that it has come
02:54:38.800 from one place and that's the consent of
02:54:40.600 the government that's the only
02:54:42.479 legitimacy they have and that's where
02:54:43.960 it's fascinating this concept of Good
02:54:45.840 and Evil because when you think about it
02:54:49.000 if this is true and if these people are
02:54:51.399 compromised because they're secretly
02:54:54.600 perverts and creeps they are though and
02:54:57.160 they're corrupt and they they steal
02:54:59.960 money or they all these different things
02:55:02.200 are evil things lying controlling people
02:55:05.720 uh engaging in unnecessary Wars that are
02:55:08.000 going to cost thousands of lives for
02:55:09.640 profit all these things are evil things
02:55:13.399 so if evil is real evil would want those
02:55:17.520 kind of people to be in a position of
02:55:19.439 power yes and here's evil would want men
02:55:22.160 to breastfeed their children here's the
02:55:23.960 like op here's the here's the illusion
02:55:26.640 that we fall for time and again we
02:55:29.200 imagine that evil comes like fully
02:55:32.800 advertised as such like evil people look
02:55:34.840 like Anton Le
02:55:37.560 yeah you know what I mean black cloak
02:55:40.200 exactly sickle
02:55:42.439 evil is an independent force that exists
02:55:44.960 outside of people that acts upon people
02:55:46.880 I really believe that I've experienced
02:55:49.359 a lot and it's obvious and what vessel
02:55:54.800 do they choose the weak it's weak men
02:55:58.319 and women who are instruments of evil
02:56:00.680 the weaker the leader the more evil that
02:56:04.160 leader will be so it's and unfortunately
02:56:07.439 we've reached a time in American history
02:56:09.399 where every leader is either a woman or
02:56:11.960 a weak man pretty much and so there's
02:56:15.399 I'm sorry to say it that's just true and
02:56:17.279 the weaker the leader that's why Mike
02:56:18.760 Johnson everyone's like oh Mike
02:56:20.200 Johnson's such a nice guy well I know
02:56:21.680 Mike Johnson and he's perfectly nice guy
02:56:23.680 to the exent that he's like polite and
02:56:25.600 seems kind of Meek and restrained and
02:56:27.760 he's not saying [ __ ] every ever
02:56:30.359 you know what I mean he's got like very
02:56:31.640 sort of button- down affect um but he's
02:56:35.000 he's a weak man and that's the man you
02:56:37.680 should be afraid of the people who you
02:56:39.960 shouldn't be less afraid of are the you
02:56:42.800 know headstrong loud don't care what
02:56:45.439 anybody thinks yeah those guys will go
02:56:46.920 off track but they're probably not going
02:56:49.560 to bet you know genocide or blow up the
02:56:51.920 world in a nuclear exchange because they
02:56:55.080 might they may be obnoxious but they
02:56:56.399 know who they are weak people just
02:56:59.040 become a host for evil you know uh an an
02:57:04.080 open empty building that evil occupies
02:57:07.720 possesses even um and that's exactly
02:57:10.720 what's happening to Mike Johnson it's
02:57:11.920 like absolutely crazy what Mike Johnson
02:57:14.000 is doing but it's not because he's evil
02:57:16.880 it's because he's weak and therefore
02:57:18.840 susceptible to evil it's a meaningful
02:57:21.319 distinction that I have noticed it is a
02:57:23.319 very strange thing how
02:57:24.880 many weak people wind up being leaders
02:57:28.680 in this society and particularly because
02:57:31.479 so many people don't want their live
02:57:33.640 exposed they don't want that eye of
02:57:36.040 Sauron gazing down upon them if they try
02:57:38.399 to run for president I get it or the
02:57:40.760 physical threat yeah physical I mean
02:57:43.080 look at what's happening to the RFK
02:57:44.840 where the Biden Administration for the
02:57:46.399 first time ever denied him secrets
02:57:48.200 service protection it's absolutely as a
02:57:50.640 legitimate presidential candidate well
02:57:52.200 it's absolutely nuts yeah I mean how is
02:57:55.239 that I mean it's hard you know you
02:57:57.640 realize that a lot of the things that we
02:57:59.120 took for granted were actually voluntary
02:58:01.359 like people just didn't do things
02:58:03.600 because like that's just wrong that's
02:58:05.359 not fair you know what I mean that's bad
02:58:08.279 sportsmanship like there was a lot of
02:58:09.920 like self-restraint involved in running
02:58:11.920 a functional Society you can't kind of
02:58:14.640 in you can't just make an infinite
02:58:16.080 number of laws and enforce them that's
02:58:17.560 impossible you rely on people to just
02:58:20.040 not do bad [ __ ] because like I'm not the
02:58:22.279 kind of person who does bad [ __ ] mhm and
02:58:24.920 once the people in charge decide well
02:58:26.359 I'm just going to do whatever I want not
02:58:28.239 a lot you can do about it so the B
02:58:30.200 Administration denies him Secret Service
02:58:32.200 protection and you're like how can you
02:58:33.200 do that like well we're doing it what
02:58:34.560 are you going to do about it [ __ ] and
02:58:37.239 like the answer is nothing actually what
02:58:39.160 is this most recent bill that they're
02:58:41.160 trying to pass uh about the ability to
02:58:44.800 monitor
02:58:46.359 phones well it's just the nightmare
02:58:49.239 scenario um it's something that they've
02:58:51.080 already capable of doing because they
02:58:53.080 did it to you and they did it through an
02:58:54.399 encrypted app oh they do oh yeah how do
02:58:56.760 they do it do you know how they use how
02:58:59.000 they got into your phone um well there
02:59:02.840 are two ways to do it's it's interesting
02:59:04.880 and I was I was with Ed Snowden um in
02:59:07.840 Moscow and talked a lot about this
02:59:09.160 because he's got the technical he's
02:59:10.680 first of all an excellent and principled
02:59:13.080 person and his his exfeed is a really
02:59:15.560 good place to start for people to
02:59:17.120 understand what's Happening Here
02:59:18.840 um he's paid a huge price for being on
02:59:21.080 obviously for he's literally exiled to
02:59:23.520 Moscow um involuntarily but uh there are
02:59:27.200 a couple ways to do it um one you know
02:59:31.160 you could hack into signal I guess it's
02:59:35.560 open source um it was created with CIA
02:59:38.479 money as I'm sure you know I'm not sure
02:59:40.800 that's how you I don't think you need to
02:59:42.080 do that you just capture the phone
02:59:43.800 itself you just capture the phone and
02:59:46.000 the bottom line on digital security is
02:59:48.520 that nothing is safe from State actors
02:59:51.279 who want to spy on you period there's no
02:59:53.600 there's no electronic communication that
02:59:55.040 they can't monitor period what about
02:59:56.600 these things like Eric Prince has some
02:59:58.120 new phone out I think it's called
02:59:59.840 unplugged yeah Eric is a good friend of
03:00:02.760 mine and I've I I have a couple of those
03:00:05.479 phones and I've talked to him a lot
03:00:06.960 about it and he's a really a wonderful
03:00:09.200 person one of my favorite people
03:00:10.880 actually um but that that phone is is
03:00:14.720 designed for a different purpose I think
03:00:17.120 I know and that that phone is designed
03:00:18.880 to keep uh Apple and Google from
03:00:21.279 tracking you which is sort of a separate
03:00:23.479 category like um was this Jimmy this is
03:00:27.120 the bill I believe I think which Bill
03:00:30.279 the one you're were talking about oh
03:00:32.000 okay house bill on
03:00:34.040 72 can we just roll down to what you
03:00:36.200 highlighted so this is like a perfect
03:00:37.520 example so um the Turner heims
03:00:41.800 Bill Congressman Mike Turner and Jim
03:00:45.080 heims so who are Mike Turner and Jim
03:00:47.319 heims so
03:00:50.640 it just be funny both those guys are the
03:00:55.000 most and who knows why and you can sort
03:00:57.279 of fill in the blank on motive I'm not
03:00:59.399 going to but those are two of the most
03:01:03.640 reliable water carriers for the Intel
03:01:06.680 agencies and for basically the federal
03:01:09.760 bureaucracy in the Congress like these
03:01:11.600 are not people who are working for their
03:01:12.920 constituents these are people who are
03:01:14.680 working for permanent Washington I would
03:01:16.600 say these are two of the most Sinister
03:01:18.439 people I know more about Turner than
03:01:20.439 Hees um but so it's not surprising
03:01:22.760 they're doing this it would permit
03:01:23.840 federal law enforcement to also Force
03:01:26.040 any other service provider with access
03:01:27.640 to Communications equipment to hand over
03:01:29.319 data anyone with access to a Wi-Fi
03:01:31.439 router server or even phone anyone from
03:01:33.239 a landlord to a laundromat will be
03:01:35.120 required to help the government spy so
03:01:37.239 that's the story right there so
03:01:39.160 basically warrantless of course
03:01:41.640 warrantless absolutely and in you know
03:01:45.359 violation of the Fourth Amendment to the
03:01:46.479 Constitution as if anyone cares anymore
03:01:48.200 no one does clearly but I just remember
03:01:50.680 when I was a kid and we're roughly the
03:01:52.800 same generation you remember this too
03:01:54.600 people be like oh East Germany like
03:01:56.720 there are more spies than there are
03:01:57.960 people East Germany was like the most
03:01:59.319 elaborate surveillance State ever
03:02:01.800 created and of course it collapsed but
03:02:03.720 we always make fun of East Germany or
03:02:05.120 North
03:02:06.319 Korea who do who has more privacy the
03:02:08.840 average North Korean or the average
03:02:10.120 American well obviously the average
03:02:11.479 North Korean because there's less
03:02:13.080 technology the US government spies on
03:02:15.359 its own population more than the North
03:02:16.680 Korean government spies on its that's
03:02:18.160 just a fact I'm not saying North Korea
03:02:20.479 is preferable I'm not moving there I'm
03:02:21.760 not carrying water for North Korea what
03:02:24.720 I'm doing is criticizing my government
03:02:27.399 because I live here because it was
03:02:29.040 better it can be better it should be
03:02:30.479 better and it only will be when we
03:02:31.840 demand it and it's not some [ __ ]
03:02:34.840 esoteric like you have to be some crazy
03:02:38.319 civil liberties lawyer or something like
03:02:40.920 every person should demand just as a
03:02:44.040 starting point a baseline that no you
03:02:46.560 you're not allowed to spy on me I didn't
03:02:47.680 do do anything wrong right like what
03:02:50.359 right no privacy no Humanity you can't
03:02:53.399 be fully human without privacy and you
03:02:56.319 also have to take into consideration
03:02:57.840 that these people that are ahead of
03:02:59.200 these intelligence agencies that are
03:03:00.880 requesting these data are just they're
03:03:02.319 just human beings they're human beings
03:03:04.720 requesting data from other human beings
03:03:06.920 without going through a court without
03:03:09.399 going to a judge and getting a warrant
03:03:11.600 without stating a case without having
03:03:14.479 like some clear National Security
03:03:17.359 mandate something of course not and
03:03:19.760 there's no justification I mean by the
03:03:21.600 way we had fisa we've had the fisa the
03:03:24.520 foreign intelligence surveillance act
03:03:28.439 since I think 1977 so it predates 9/11
03:03:31.880 did it stop 911 oh I don't think it did
03:03:34.080 shut the [ __ ] up you're not protecting
03:03:35.920 us actually you open the southern border
03:03:37.920 to anyone who wants to come you're not
03:03:39.160 checking IDs you're not doing any kind
03:03:40.600 of Biometrics you're not even screening
03:03:41.960 for covid so clearly you don't care
03:03:43.479 about my safety stop telling me you do
03:03:45.319 you don't you're a criminal stop this a
03:03:48.840 you don't care about my safety so using
03:03:51.960 my safety as a pretext for spying me is
03:03:54.279 not going to fly cuz I'm not that stupid
03:03:56.479 I may be kind of stupid I'm not that
03:03:57.800 stupid no you're doing this for one
03:04:00.560 simple reason because this is what
03:04:01.920 organizations do they protect themselves
03:04:05.279 they exist for their own benefit all
03:04:07.200 human organizations from the church bake
03:04:09.560 sale committee to the Department of
03:04:11.439 Justice they all are the same they're an
03:04:13.840 organism just like any other and an
03:04:16.080 organism's main goal is is to survive
03:04:18.800 and reproduce to get bigger and you just
03:04:21.760 see this throughout the federal
03:04:22.760 bureaucracy well just so happens that
03:04:24.040 the largest human organization in
03:04:26.120 history is the federal government of the
03:04:27.439 United States and so all of this stuff
03:04:31.319 benefits it it acrs to its own power
03:04:33.479 that's like like let's say you believed
03:04:35.399 every quote piece of science or
03:04:37.760 scientific Claim about global climate
03:04:39.800 change you would not reach the same
03:04:41.840 policy conclusions you be like well the
03:04:43.960 first thing we need to do is Ban private
03:04:45.279 air travel because obviously that
03:04:46.319 doesn't make any sense and then the
03:04:47.960 second thing we need to do is you know
03:04:49.479 whatever you you'd look at it rationally
03:04:50.880 from a scientific if if you bought the
03:04:52.319 premise which I don't but if you did you
03:04:54.840 would that no you go through every
03:04:57.800 climate quote climate demand not one of
03:05:01.520 them disempowers large organizations
03:05:04.239 whether it's NOS or the government of
03:05:06.239 the United States not one of them they
03:05:07.840 all make the government more powerful
03:05:09.800 and they all make you less powerful so
03:05:12.239 that's when you know it's not really
03:05:13.319 about the temperature of the Earth's
03:05:15.800 atmosphere it's about making them more
03:05:17.920 powerful and disempowering you and it's
03:05:20.279 not about who runs those agencies the
03:05:22.640 bigger the agency the more effective it
03:05:24.359 will be in doing what all human
03:05:26.279 organizations do which is protect
03:05:28.560 themselves and increase their power it's
03:05:30.479 like that it's fundamental I guess
03:05:31.840 that's what I'm saying it's not about oh
03:05:33.160 elect Trump it'll change no it'll only
03:05:35.160 change when like we're just eliminating
03:05:37.040 the CIA and we're going to have like a
03:05:39.439 small Intel Gathering service that feeds
03:05:41.720 the president relevant information so we
03:05:43.479 can make inform foreign policy decisions
03:05:45.880 but we're not going to we're not going
03:05:47.479 to like overturn elections in other
03:05:49.239 countries in the name of democracy
03:05:50.680 because that's insane if we believe in
03:05:53.080 democracy then we're going to let people
03:05:54.359 vote for their own leaders because we
03:05:56.040 believe in democracy as a principle
03:05:58.439 right like you just get rid of all this
03:06:00.040 [ __ ] because it's not helping us it's
03:06:01.560 only hurting us and um it would take
03:06:05.479 someone uh you know who'd be willing to
03:06:07.600 be assassinated to do anything like that
03:06:10.359 and so is is you're choosing your
03:06:12.160 leaders ask yourself does this person
03:06:13.840 mean it enough to die and that's the
03:06:17.000 same question you ask about your own dad
03:06:18.439 does he love me enough to die for me
03:06:19.960 about your own husband does he love me
03:06:21.960 enough to protect me from a home home
03:06:23.279 Invader at risk to himself like the the
03:06:26.319 basic prerequisite for leadership is
03:06:28.080 love of the people you lead and the
03:06:30.399 willingness to die for them and if you
03:06:31.920 don't have that you shouldn't be leading
03:06:33.680 period it's true in the military it's
03:06:35.640 true in business it's true in your home
03:06:37.000 and it's true in the government and so
03:06:38.680 no president will fix this unless he's
03:06:40.399 like literally willing to die for it and
03:06:42.960 short of that it can't be
03:06:44.800 fixed I could think of no better way to
03:06:46.800 end this conversation than that Joe
03:06:48.880 Rogan ladies and gentlemen nailed it
03:06:51.399 well listen man it's been very fun
03:06:53.279 getting to know you I think you are a uh
03:06:58.680 very you're you're a controversial
03:07:01.160 character in the world but you're
03:07:04.279 misunderstood and uh I think if people
03:07:06.520 pay attention to your actual work and
03:07:08.319 the things that you talk about I think
03:07:10.120 you're you're generally a force of good
03:07:13.040 I really believe that I feel like I'm
03:07:14.520 the most conventional person who's ever
03:07:16.160 lived yeah I don't think I'm radical at
03:07:18.960 all I'm the opposite in this crazy
03:07:21.640 time someone who's conventional and and
03:07:25.000 wise seems radical maybe I'm hoping for
03:07:28.120 a better time yeah I think a better
03:07:30.080 time's possible me too I do it's just uh
03:07:34.000 we're in for a rough
03:07:35.920 ride yeah I'm not I'm not disarming
03:07:38.279 anytime soon sorry yeah thank you Tucker
