00:00:02.159 here we go
00:00:04.080 and boom we're live graham great to see
00:00:06.799 you again nice to meet you joe um and we
00:00:09.360 were just talking about your your new
00:00:10.960 book
00:00:11.920 america before that there's two versions
00:00:13.759 of it there's one version and then
00:00:15.280 there's a newer version that's a barnes
00:00:16.880 noble version that's specific to barnes
00:00:18.960 and noble that has an extra whole
00:00:20.480 chapter in it that's correct yeah yeah
00:00:22.400 and so they can get that at barnes noble
00:00:24.480 i'm just trying to keep bookstores alive
00:00:26.080 man
00:00:27.039 i think it's really important and that's
00:00:28.480 and that's one of the reasons that i did
00:00:30.240 this because because i i had finished
00:00:32.238 the book and then barnes and noble came
00:00:35.200 to me through my publishers and and said
00:00:37.200 they would like to do a special edition
00:00:39.280 of the book but in order to do that i
00:00:41.040 needed to write them some extra material
00:00:43.600 uh and and i had a lot of material that
00:00:46.399 i hadn't put in the book and i thought
00:00:47.680 well this is an opportunity to to put
00:00:49.760 that out there beautiful so if people
00:00:51.520 want that it's a little bit different
00:00:52.800 than there's a small gold well okay so
00:00:56.239 first of all my website
00:00:58.280 graemehancock.com has a page about
00:01:01.120 america before and the link to the
00:01:03.199 barnes noble edition is there as well as
00:01:05.519 the link to the standard edition which
00:01:07.119 is on amazon and itunes and all kinds of
00:01:09.439 all kinds of other places so graham
00:01:10.840 hancock.com and the america before page
00:01:12.799 the link to the barnes noble edition is
00:01:14.640 right there all right there it is so um
00:01:17.600 how is this before we can get into what
00:01:19.920 is it go to talks and events
00:01:22.960 okay we're on the graham hancock website
00:01:27.040 go to books go to america before boom
00:01:30.479 bam
00:01:31.680 there it is go to united states you can

00:01:36.320 noble special edition special edition
00:01:38.400 click on that there you go and then the
00:01:40.159 ebook as well the ebook is available the
00:01:42.640 audiobook which i read myself is
00:01:44.799 available there then if you scroll down
00:01:47.520 um oops that shouldn't be there damn
00:01:50.159 pop-ups
00:01:52.720 i am so happy you read it yourself i get
00:01:54.560 angry when someone else reads someone
00:01:56.399 who i'm like come on he can talk
00:01:58.799 yeah i i enjoy reading my books myself
00:02:01.520 and and what i've what i've learned from
00:02:04.000 feedback i get from audiences at
00:02:05.520 presentations is people like me doing
00:02:07.200 that oh yeah for sure yeah yeah a
00:02:09.598 hundred percent it's just weird when
00:02:10.878 someone else is talking in your voice
00:02:12.160 like hey man i know you're not graham
00:02:13.520 you know that i write fiction as well as
00:02:15.040 the announcement yeah and the one thing
00:02:16.480 i can't read is my fiction really well
00:02:19.280 yeah because fiction requires accents
00:02:21.040 you really need an actor
00:02:22.400 to read a fiction book who can get into
00:02:24.080 the different characters but for a
00:02:25.440 non-fiction book like america before
00:02:27.440 it's very straightforward for me just to
00:02:29.040 read it myself i agree i'm a tremendous
00:02:31.280 stephen king fan but when i read stephen
00:02:33.840 king's books where he reads them or
00:02:35.760 listen to him when he reads them they're
00:02:37.120 terrible he's awful at it i don't think
00:02:39.519 a novelist should should read their own
00:02:41.760 their own novels i think that's that's a
00:02:43.280 job for for an actor oddly enough i've
00:02:44.879 just been reading stephen king's dark
00:02:46.400 tower series yeah very near the end of
00:02:48.480 the seventh volume of that yeah i'm just
00:02:50.080 a giant fan of his but man when he reads
00:02:52.080 it he reads it like he's just reading it
00:02:54.080 yeah it's like oh this is rough it's
00:02:56.720 hard to get behind anyway um
00:02:59.200 america before um
00:03:00.959 so there's give us on the website
00:03:02.720 there's there's details about the book
00:03:04.400 there's a page where there are links to
00:03:06.400 the book and also the other thing i
00:03:07.599 would like to take this opportunity to
00:03:09.120 mention is i'm in america and canada for
00:03:12.159 the next seven weeks and i'm going to be
00:03:14.080 doing something like 25 presentations in
00:03:17.040 something like 20 american cities and
00:03:18.640 then three canadian cities in in
00:03:20.879 vancouver uh montreal and toronto and
00:03:24.319 that's all on the talks and events page
00:03:26.000 of my website so if anybody wants to
00:03:27.280 come along
00:03:28.720 and
00:03:29.760 meet this old man in person uh i will be
00:03:32.239 i'll be doing those events and are you
00:03:34.080 doing these at theaters and do you allow
00:03:35.920 q and a's like how absolutely absolutely
00:03:38.000 i allow i allow q a's i encourage that i
00:03:40.959 i feel as an author that frankly
00:03:43.440 speaking i'm nothing without my audience
00:03:45.200 i owe my audience my readers big time
00:03:48.799 and what i try to do at events is to
00:03:51.280 give back as much as i can so if people
00:03:53.120 want to take pictures with me i am
00:03:54.879 absolutely up for that i don't
00:03:56.560 understand why anybody would want to do
00:03:58.159 that but it's fun it's kind of fun and
00:04:00.480 when people want to come to the desk
00:04:01.760 where i'm signing and ask me personal
00:04:03.120 questions i'm ready to do that sometimes
00:04:05.439 on the british book tour which i just
00:04:06.720 finished i was behind in the in the
00:04:08.560 event space for four hours after the
00:04:10.319 event finished wow signing and taking
00:04:12.799 and taking pictures but it's a joy it's
00:04:14.959 a really opportunity for me to interact
00:04:16.639 with with with the people who actually
00:04:18.478 make my work matters that's fantastic
00:04:20.399 beautiful so what inspired this uh i
00:04:23.040 know
00:04:23.759 there's there's always been well you
00:04:25.919 first of all we should just say for
00:04:27.040 people who don't know
00:04:28.560 you have been at the front of the line
00:04:31.600 um for decades talking about these lost
00:04:35.840 civilizations and
00:04:39.600 from reading your work i mean i think
00:04:41.280 i've first read your work in the 90s
00:04:43.680 you exposed me to a lot of these what
00:04:46.800 were at the time controversial ideas
00:04:49.199 that have now been substantiated by
00:04:51.520 actual evidence particularly gobekli
00:04:53.360 teppy and
00:04:54.560 i mean the the the all the water erosion
00:04:57.360 stuff on the sphinx and i've since had
00:04:58.960 dr robert shock on the podcast to talk
00:05:00.720 about that as well but all this stuff um
00:05:03.520 was at one point very controversial and
00:05:06.720 now far less yes i mean whatever
00:05:09.919 traditional academics and traditional
00:05:12.240 historians that are trying to i guess as
00:05:13.840 archaeologists that we're trying to
00:05:15.680 resist they've let go a lot of that
00:05:17.759 they've had to with things like gobekli
00:05:19.759 they've had to because the evidence has
00:05:21.199 has overwhelmed them and go back to tepe
00:05:23.120 is an excellent example prior to the
00:05:25.520 discovery and excavation of gobeklitepi
00:05:28.479 uh which is a site in anatolia in turkey
00:05:31.440 it was the view very firm view of
00:05:33.360 archaeologists that there had been no
00:05:34.880 megalithic architecture anywhere on
00:05:37.120 earth and when i say megalithic i mean
00:05:38.560 literally big stones stone circles huge
00:05:40.880 constructions nothing like that before
00:05:42.960 at the very very earliest six thousand
00:05:45.199 years ago and they would point to sites
00:05:47.360 in for example malta a site called
00:05:49.520 gigantea which is about 5800 years old
00:05:52.400 that's the oldest megalithic
00:05:53.600 architecture in the world and they could
00:05:55.440 understand how that was because these
00:05:57.280 were agricultural societies they
00:05:58.880 generated surpluses you could free up
00:06:00.880 people who could become specialists in
00:06:03.199 architecture in astronomy and geometry
00:06:05.120 and they could apply their skills to the
00:06:06.479 construction of these sites but what
00:06:07.759 they never considered possible was that
00:06:10.319 a society that was hunter-gatherers
00:06:12.800 would have created a gigantic megalithic
00:06:15.039 site and then suddenly gobekli tepe is
00:06:17.520 discovered it dates to 11 600 years ago
00:06:21.440 it's more than 5 000 years older than
00:06:23.360 the supposedly oldest megalithic
00:06:25.120 architecture in the world and it is in
00:06:27.199 the center where there had been no
00:06:28.560 previous evidence of agriculture but the
00:06:30.319 moment gobekli tepe appears agriculture
00:06:32.800 appears as well um and this is just
00:06:35.840 something that's really hard for
00:06:37.120 archaeology to explain they've suddenly
00:06:38.560 got 5000 years of missing of missing
00:06:40.880 history that they've just never taken
00:06:42.240 into account and what i see them doing
00:06:43.759 is largely avoiding the problem rather
00:06:46.479 than getting getting to grips with it
00:06:48.800 directly and in fact there have been
00:06:51.199 there have been a great number of
00:06:52.639 changes in the last uh 20 years which
00:06:55.680 which uh have worked generally in favor
00:06:58.960 of the arguments that i've that i've
00:07:00.639 proposed well i'm so happy for you
00:07:02.639 because i know that for a long time you
00:07:04.240 were out there on your own with a lot of
00:07:06.319 these theories very very much so and and
00:07:08.960 uh
00:07:10.560 also sub subjected to the most the most
00:07:13.520 blistering and deeply unpleasant
00:07:15.759 criticism from uh from the
00:07:18.080 archaeological fraternity and from their
00:07:19.919 friends in the in in the media like how
00:07:22.720 dare this uh journalists uh propose that
00:07:26.000 history might be different or that we
00:07:27.280 might have a forgotten chapter in the
00:07:29.759 human story it was regarded almost as
00:07:31.360 offensive that i would put this material
00:07:33.280 out there and archaeologists felt it was
00:07:34.560 their responsibility to show the public
00:07:37.840 that i was full of [ __ ] and that was and
00:07:39.840 that was the whole way my work was was
00:07:42.160 greeted and in to a certain extent still
00:07:44.240 is greeted by archaeologists but things
00:07:45.919 have changed central to my work was the
00:07:48.080 notion of a global cataclysm roughly
00:07:50.080 twelve thousand five hundred twelve
00:07:51.280 thousand eight hundred years ago there
00:07:52.880 was
00:07:54.080 it made sense to me in 1995 when i wrote
00:07:56.800 fingerprints of the gods but there was
00:07:58.400 no compelling evidence for a global
00:08:00.080 cataclysm then i just all the evidence
00:08:02.240 seemed to point to that time and a
00:08:04.240 massive global event and then from 2007
00:08:06.960 onwards you know more than a decade
00:08:09.680 after i wrote fingerprints of the gods
00:08:11.120 we get a group of more than 60 major
00:08:13.199 scientists who are seriously proposing
00:08:15.120 that the earth was hit by multiple
00:08:16.720 fragments of a giant comet 12 800 years
00:08:19.680 ago and that this caused a huge rise in
00:08:21.440 sea level and extinctions of megafaunas
00:08:24.000 they are not saying that it also wiped
00:08:25.919 out a lost advanced civilization of
00:08:28.000 prehistory i'm saying that um but but
00:08:30.960 what what has changed is that we now
00:08:32.880 have compelling hard scientific evidence
00:08:35.440 i'm not saying every scientist accepts
00:08:37.039 it it's the nature of science to dispute
00:08:38.799 findings but we have a group of 60 major
00:08:41.360 figures who have seriously proposed this
00:08:43.599 in all the leading mainstream journals
00:08:45.360 and it's changed the balance of power in
00:08:47.760 this in this argument because one thing
00:08:49.680 that they used to say is hancock can't
00:08:51.600 be right because there was no global
00:08:53.120 cataclysm you know 12 or 13 000 years
00:08:55.519 ago well now we know there was and there
00:08:57.519 are various explanations for it so
00:08:59.040 that's moved things along and the other
00:09:00.240 thing that's changed a lot
00:09:02.560 is the attitude of
00:09:04.800 the man in the street
00:09:06.399 to
00:09:07.279 authority that has changed back in the
00:09:09.680 90s authority figures were the
00:09:12.160 gatekeepers they controlled everything
00:09:13.680 if an authority figure in a discipline
00:09:15.760 like archaeology said hancock is
00:09:17.519 completely wrong he's made all this
00:09:19.200 stuff up that would generally be
00:09:21.120 believed not by everybody but by the
00:09:23.040 majority of people today to have a
00:09:25.839 mainstream authority figure say that to
00:09:27.600 me is actually an advantage because
00:09:29.600 people are are so distrustful of
00:09:31.440 authority and rightly so because we've
00:09:33.040 been lied to by authority figures in all
00:09:35.120 fields for so long the [ __ ] has been
00:09:37.839 so enormous that people are finally
00:09:39.680 waking up but we can't trust what
00:09:41.200 authority figures say and i think we can
00:09:43.040 thank the internet for that we can thank
00:09:44.560 the internet yeah i'm sure you've seen
00:09:46.480 the more recent evidence of a crater
00:09:48.640 that they just discovered like fairly
00:09:50.399 recently greenland yes enormous
00:09:53.680 it's an enormous crater it's um 18 miles
00:09:57.279 wide
00:09:58.640 it had not been discovered before
00:10:00.320 because it's under ice it's under a lot
00:10:02.800 of ice at the end of the ice age
00:10:04.399 greenland was one area which never lost
00:10:06.480 its ice cover completely whereas north
00:10:08.240 america everywhere north of minnesota
00:10:10.320 was covered in ice a mile sometimes two
00:10:12.080 miles deep europe the same northern
00:10:14.240 europe but greenland
00:10:15.920 kept its eyes whereas the other parts of
00:10:18.160 the world lost their eyes at the at the
00:10:20.000 end of the ice age
00:10:21.760 and what's
00:10:23.279 interesting about greenland is there's
00:10:24.720 already evidence of
00:10:26.720 comet impact in greenland which goes
00:10:28.560 back to papers published in the
00:10:30.160 proceedings of the national academy of
00:10:31.600 sciences in 2013
00:10:33.920 that they found what are called impact
00:10:35.600 proxies in greenland in other words
00:10:38.079 nanodiamonds um carbon spherules and
00:10:41.120 evidence of a lot of platinum and iron
00:10:44.399 was found in a layer in the ice dated to
00:10:47.360 12 800 years ago but the next
00:10:49.760 development that you're absolutely right
00:10:51.040 and this was just a few months ago was
00:10:53.120 the discovery of this humongous crater
00:10:55.440 in greenland and evidence that it was
00:10:57.519 caused by an iron impactor of some kind
00:11:01.279 now
00:11:02.320 dating of it i would be irresponsible to
00:11:04.240 say that that crater definitely dates to
00:11:06.959 12 800 years ago because the work has
00:11:09.120 not been done to prove that yet but what
00:11:11.360 i can say and what the
00:11:13.680 specialists who have explored and
00:11:15.839 excavated the crater are saying is that
00:11:18.320 it's recent
00:11:19.680 they can say for sure that it happened
00:11:21.360 during the last ice age under it under
00:11:23.760 the crater is nothing but massively
00:11:25.680 disturbed and destroyed and completely
00:11:28.320 wrecked ice from the ice age from the
00:11:30.640 pleistocene above it is smooth perfect
00:11:32.880 ice from our epoch which is called the
00:11:34.640 holocene which began about 11 600 years
00:11:37.680 ago so all the evidence suggests that
00:11:40.320 this crater dates to that period between
00:11:42.480 twelve thousand eight hundred and eleven
00:11:44.000 thousand six hundred years ago but to
00:11:45.680 absolutely confirm that more work needs
00:11:47.600 to be done but it's part of a growing
00:11:49.279 pattern the younger dryers uh impact uh
00:11:52.800 scientists they is they call themselves
00:11:55.200 they call this the younger driest impact
00:11:57.279 hypothesis and it's because there was a
00:11:59.760 period in
00:12:00.959 in the earth's geological history that
00:12:03.040 geologists call the younger dryas which
00:12:04.880 lasted for one thousand two hundred
00:12:06.320 years from twelve thousand eight hundred
00:12:08.240 to eleven thousand six 600 years ago
00:12:09.920 it's a very mysterious period we see all
00:12:11.760 the megafauna dying off
00:12:13.680 suddenly and rapidly we see rises in sea
00:12:16.560 level we see huge collapse in in global
00:12:18.800 temperature it's a it's a cataclysmic
00:12:21.680 epoch and and what what what is becoming
00:12:24.560 clearer and and clearer
00:12:26.880 uh is that the evidence that a comet
00:12:28.880 behind it was behind it is it is
00:12:30.959 extremely strong and as more and more
00:12:32.800 evidence comes in we realize how
00:12:34.639 widespread it was so they found evidence
00:12:36.320 of the impacts as far south as
00:12:37.760 antarctica now previously they were
00:12:39.360 focused very much on north america now
00:12:41.279 as far south as antarctica as far east
00:12:43.600 as syria this was truly a global a
00:12:46.240 global event and and it changed the
00:12:48.079 world and i think and it's my case that
00:12:51.360 it wiped our memory of a previous
00:12:53.920 episode of of human civilization that
00:12:56.240 right at the epicentre of this cataclysm
00:12:57.920 was a civilization that we would regard
00:13:00.320 as advanced not a simple hunter-gatherer
00:13:02.639 civilization which was utterly wiped out
00:13:05.519 in this cataclysmic event and i should
00:13:07.360 say for anyone who's really fascinated
00:13:10.000 right now please
00:13:11.680 maybe pause and go listen to the one
00:13:14.639 that the two that you did with randall
00:13:16.399 carlson where really goes into depth
00:13:18.800 about the impact the evidence of these
00:13:20.720 impacts the evidence of the very quick
00:13:23.040 demise of the ice age and what may have
00:13:26.320 resulted in all these floods that you
00:13:28.160 read about in the epic of gilgamesh that
00:13:30.079 you read about in noah's ark and that
00:13:31.600 all these things are probably tales
00:13:34.399 of stories that people pass down from
00:13:36.399 generation to generation that survive
00:13:38.639 this time yeah because we now know that
00:13:40.399 at that time between 12 800 and 11 600
00:13:43.519 years ago truly global cataclysmic
00:13:45.360 events involving rapid rises in sea
00:13:47.600 level
00:13:48.399 did occur and suddenly the the worldwide
00:13:50.560 tradition of a of a global flood
00:13:53.040 stops being just a myth and starts being
00:13:55.440 a memory an account of of real events
00:13:57.839 it's been my privilege to work very
00:13:59.519 closely with randall carson yeah he's
00:14:02.079 absolutely amazing he is a total
00:14:04.880 genius he's also a gentle giant and such
00:14:07.279 a kind generous spirited person it's a
00:14:09.680 joy to work with him and every minute
00:14:11.600 spent with him is an education i had the
00:14:13.279 privilege of traveling across the
00:14:14.639 channel scablands in washington state
00:14:16.320 with randall and seeing things through
00:14:18.320 his eyes really opened my eyes to the
00:14:20.399 scale of this disaster you know you
00:14:21.760 could look at these giant boulders
00:14:23.120 called glacial erratics and they just
00:14:25.120 look odd sitting there in the landscape
00:14:26.639 but when you really consider how they
00:14:28.240 got there that they got there in
00:14:30.560 icebergs the size of oil tankers that
00:14:32.959 were carried on floods that were at
00:14:34.560 least 500 up to a thousand feet deep
00:14:36.800 that were tearing through the channeled
00:14:38.880 scapulas literally ripping the landscape
00:14:41.199 apart then the icebergs would ground on
00:14:43.440 valley sides the flood waters would
00:14:45.440 recede the icebergs would be left
00:14:46.959 they're giant icebergs and as they
00:14:48.880 melted away they revealed the rocks that
00:14:50.800 they had in chain that were caught up
00:14:52.480 within them and they're scattered all
00:14:53.760 over the landscape and you look at that
00:14:55.040 and you think anything that was
00:14:56.720 underneath that 12 800 years ago is gone
00:15:01.040 completely there can't be anything left
00:15:03.360 of it at all utterly utterly destroyed
00:15:05.760 and i would encourage people that are
00:15:07.600 interested in this to please watch the
00:15:09.040 youtube videos of it because randall
00:15:10.720 provides all sorts of video and
00:15:13.040 photographic evidence where you can take
00:15:15.040 a look at the landscape and you get a
00:15:16.560 perspective of how immense this
00:15:19.279 destruction was yeah it's it's really
00:15:21.199 it's really important to
00:15:22.880 to see that because it's easy enough to
00:15:24.560 talk about floods and and cataclysms but
00:15:27.040 actually to see its effect on the
00:15:28.720 landscape uh directly
00:15:31.040 um is uh it has an emotional and
00:15:34.079 emotional impact i felt i felt emotional
00:15:36.399 traveling traveling across the channels
00:15:37.839 gap lands real realizing that this was
00:15:40.160 was the heart
00:15:41.600 of an event
00:15:42.800 that changed the world uh completely
00:15:46.320 and the evidence continues to build i
00:15:48.959 have in america before i've not gone
00:15:50.880 over old ground that i went over in
00:15:52.800 magicians of the gods that we covered in
00:15:55.120 the various
00:15:56.480 interviews and podcasts in which it's
00:15:58.000 really a good idea that people take a
00:15:59.759 look at but what i have done is added
00:16:02.000 the new information published since 2015
00:16:05.040 which further supports the younger dryas
00:16:07.040 impact hypothesis and the notion that
00:16:09.519 multiple fragments of a giant comet hit
00:16:12.000 the earth and and created a absolute
00:16:14.320 global catastrophe so what was the
00:16:16.480 motivation behind creating this book
00:16:18.800 america before
00:16:21.120 it's a curious mixture of things i
00:16:24.160 have been exploring the possibility of a
00:16:27.360 lost civilization for more than 25 years
00:16:30.240 that was the essence of my book
00:16:32.079 fingerprints of the gods that was
00:16:33.279 published in 1995 that there has been a
00:16:36.320 huge forgotten episode in human history
00:16:38.480 i continued to follow that in a series
00:16:40.320 of other books and by the time i got to
00:16:42.440 2002
00:16:44.000 when i published a book called
00:16:45.279 underworld that followed seven years of
00:16:48.560 scuba diving on continental shelves
00:16:50.959 looking for structures that were
00:16:52.079 submerged by rising sea levels at the
00:16:53.920 end of the last ice age
00:16:55.600 i really felt i'd done it i felt i'd
00:16:58.320 walk the walk i'd
00:17:00.000 put put out to the public a massive body
00:17:02.320 of information and i thought my role in
00:17:05.359 this is over and i can breathe a sigh of
00:17:08.079 relief because it's hot in this
00:17:09.280 particular kitchen and i can go do
00:17:11.359 something else and i ended up writing a
00:17:12.959 book about psychedelics i ended up
00:17:14.559 writing supernatural meetings with the
00:17:16.319 ancient teachers of mankind about the
00:17:17.760 role of psychedelics in in the origins
00:17:19.679 of the of the human story but then
00:17:22.160 new information started to come out that
00:17:24.160 touched on the lost civilization idea
00:17:26.160 and i couldn't just stand by and ignore
00:17:27.919 that information that's why i published
00:17:30.320 magicians of the gods in 2015
00:17:33.039 and then as i was researching that book
00:17:35.200 i became aware of something i hadn't
00:17:36.960 realized before that there's a mass of
00:17:39.360 new information from the americas
00:17:41.360 specifically from the americas which
00:17:43.440 completely rewrites the story of human
00:17:45.440 history that the americas
00:17:47.600 have been misrepresented
00:17:50.080 for a very long time
00:17:51.919 by archaeology and archaeologists will
00:17:53.600 be annoyed with me for saying that they
00:17:55.360 have a way of forgetting their own
00:17:57.360 errors
00:17:58.400 of saying oh well we knew that all along
00:18:00.080 it wasn't it wasn't the case but the
00:18:01.520 fact of the matter remains that for best
00:18:03.200 part of 50 years from the 1960s through
00:18:05.520 until about 2010 american archaeology
00:18:08.720 was locked in a dogma that they actually
00:18:11.520 had a name for which was clovis first
00:18:15.360 that they invented a name for a culture
00:18:17.840 they called them the clovis culture we
00:18:19.360 don't know what they called themselves
00:18:21.600 they were hunter-gatherers
00:18:23.600 they first appear in the archaeological
00:18:25.600 record thirteen thousand four hundred
00:18:27.679 years ago and they vanish from the
00:18:29.520 archaeological record twelve thousand
00:18:31.120 six hundred years ago and for a very
00:18:32.720 long time it was maintained adamantly
00:18:35.120 that these were the first americans that
00:18:37.200 no human being
00:18:38.720 touched the soil of the americas until
00:18:40.960 13 400 years ago just animals but no
00:18:44.000 human beings present at all and any
00:18:46.880 archaeologist who attempted to dispute
00:18:49.039 that dogma and i use the word
00:18:51.039 deliberately there should be no room for
00:18:53.200 dogma in science but any archaeologist
00:18:56.240 who challenged that
00:18:57.760 would face severe problems with his or
00:19:00.320 her career they would be mocked and
00:19:02.880 humiliated at conferences like an
00:19:04.720 archaeologist called jackshank mars from
00:19:06.880 from canada who excavated in the in the
00:19:08.799 in the yukon humiliated at conferences
00:19:11.440 insulted accused of making stuff up uh
00:19:14.240 their research funding would be
00:19:15.760 withdrawn basically to challenge clovis
00:19:18.080 first was the end of your archaeological
00:19:19.919 career so naturally very few
00:19:21.679 archaeologists wanted to challenge
00:19:23.520 clovis first what was this gentleman in
00:19:25.200 the yukon what was this he's called jack
00:19:26.880 sank mars
00:19:28.320 and interestingly the smithsonian just
00:19:30.400 in 2017 uh did a big kind of maya culpa
00:19:34.320 big admission about this that everybody
00:19:36.320 had got things wrong that jack sank mars
00:19:38.320 had been ruined by the clovis first
00:19:40.320 lobby but he'd been right all along the
00:19:42.960 site he excavated in the yukon was
00:19:44.720 re-excavated in 2017 and every single
00:19:47.760 thing he said was correct even though
00:19:49.760 they had just sneered at him and what
00:19:52.000 year was he um
00:19:54.000 he was excavating in the 1980s in the
00:19:55.840 1990s
00:19:56.960 he's still alive he's still alive yeah
00:19:58.880 is he bitter well i think he's
00:20:00.559 vindicated you know and it's kind of
00:20:02.080 it's kind of nice to be vindicated
00:20:04.559 there's almost a place in folklore
00:20:06.160 folklore for the for the individual who
00:20:08.160 is scorned and humiliated you know by by
00:20:10.880 others but who turns out to be to be
00:20:12.960 right and he and he was right but my
00:20:15.200 point about this is that
00:20:17.280 what it meant was
00:20:18.960 since it was the dogma that clovis was
00:20:21.440 first that the oldest states were 13 400
00:20:24.559 years ago there seemed to be no logic to
00:20:26.880 archaeologists in digging deeper you
00:20:28.799 know how it is with archaeology that the
00:20:30.640 the upper levels are the youngest and
00:20:32.400 the deeper you go the older it gets
00:20:34.480 that's why we say upper paleolithic for
00:20:36.640 the late ice age and lower paleolithic
00:20:38.720 for the late start age and lower for the
00:20:40.960 older
00:20:42.159 stone age and the feeling was no need to
00:20:45.039 dig below the clovis layer because we
00:20:47.120 already know that there were no human
00:20:49.039 beings there before that and then a few
00:20:50.960 archaeologists i mentioned jack sank
00:20:52.559 mars but but
00:20:53.919 another is al gudyer from the university
00:20:56.320 of south carolina uh who excavated a
00:20:58.880 site called topper in south carolina now
00:21:01.919 topper is an incredibly rich clovis site
00:21:04.159 it's full of their tools their points
00:21:05.919 they made these special special flint
00:21:07.919 points that were used as arrowheads and
00:21:09.360 spears
00:21:10.320 a great clovis site
00:21:12.159 he finished excavating the clovis level
00:21:14.480 and then he did something
00:21:16.960 that was supposed not to be done he
00:21:18.960 decided to dig deeper and he carried on
00:21:21.200 deeping down digging down and there was
00:21:22.799 a layer of about a meter and a half of
00:21:24.960 of barren soil and then beneath that
00:21:27.440 more human artifacts and they finally
00:21:29.520 date those back to more than 50 000
00:21:31.840 years ago and then in 2017 published in
00:21:35.679 nature
00:21:37.360 by tom demare who's the chief
00:21:38.799 paleontologist at the san diego natural
00:21:40.799 history museum
00:21:42.240 and a bunch of other very high level uh
00:21:44.960 paleontologists published in nature
00:21:47.120 magazine evidence for human presence in
00:21:49.039 north america
00:21:50.440 130 000 years ago now this has really
00:21:53.360 put the cat amongst the pigeons now if
00:21:55.120 humans were present in north america 130
00:21:57.840 000 years ago and archaeologists have
00:21:59.600 been telling us for 50 years that they
00:22:01.280 were only present from 13 000 years ago
00:22:04.400 that's 10 times as long that we've had
00:22:06.880 humans in north america capable of doing
00:22:08.960 stuff and the archaeological dogma has
00:22:11.280 prevented any search for what they were
00:22:13.280 doing until until very recently what was
00:22:15.679 the evidence from 130 000 years ago okay
00:22:17.760 so what it's not the let me be clear
00:22:19.919 about this because because this is this
00:22:22.159 is something that is often
00:22:23.120 misrepresented in in my views it is not
00:22:25.600 the evidence for an advanced
00:22:27.440 civilization that we find 130 000 years
00:22:30.799 ago in america the evidence that we find
00:22:33.280 is evidence for human presence and what
00:22:35.760 they were doing was very much stone age
00:22:37.679 stuff it's a mastodon it's a mastodon
00:22:40.400 skeleton uh that was that was excavated
00:22:43.280 it was actually found by accident during
00:22:44.960 road construction near
00:22:47.039 near san diego um and and
00:22:49.840 an archaeologist was attached to the
00:22:51.440 road construction crew and immediately
00:22:52.960 stopped construction and they
00:22:54.480 investigated it thoroughly and what they
00:22:56.880 found was so much dynamite in the early
00:23:00.159 1990s when they found it that they
00:23:02.320 decided not to publish at the time
00:23:04.320 because what they found was evidence
00:23:05.760 that those mastodon bones had been
00:23:07.440 cracked open by human beings using tools
00:23:10.799 and that the marrow had been extracted
00:23:13.360 that one tusk had been left standing
00:23:15.200 upright in the ground and another had
00:23:17.280 been left beside it that
00:23:18.960 femur had a femur of the animal had been
00:23:20.960 taken away completely from the site
00:23:23.280 and there was assemblages of of
00:23:25.520 instruments that were used to smash and
00:23:26.960 break the bones and the conclusion of
00:23:28.320 the team was that only one kind of
00:23:30.640 creature could have done that work using
00:23:33.360 tools on a mastodon and that's human
00:23:36.080 beings that's classic classic human
00:23:38.080 behavior so this sets the goal posts in
00:23:41.440 a totally different place suddenly we
00:23:43.200 have to consider that humans have been
00:23:44.640 in america for 130 000 years we already
00:23:47.600 know that a dogmatic approach of
00:23:49.039 archaeology has rather refused to look
00:23:51.760 at anything older than 13 000 years ago
00:23:54.240 and what it does is
00:23:55.760 it generates an engine of demand that we
00:23:58.320 need to be looking at those missing
00:24:00.080 hundred thousand plus years we need to
00:24:01.840 be looking at it hard of course the
00:24:03.120 immediate reaction has not been to go
00:24:05.440 looking for stuff in the other hundred
00:24:07.120 thousand years most archaeologists have
00:24:09.360 responded by saying this is impossible
00:24:11.279 it can't be it can't be so but that's
00:24:13.039 precisely what they said to jacques mars
00:24:15.360 who said that humans were in blue fish
00:24:17.120 caves in the yukon 25 000 years ago and
00:24:19.360 it's precisely what they said to al
00:24:20.799 gudye who said humans had been at topper
00:24:23.200 50 000 years ago and they were both
00:24:25.279 right and i believe that tom demare and
00:24:28.080 his team you don't get a big article
00:24:30.640 published in nature unless it's already
00:24:32.880 pretty solidly based and pretty much
00:24:34.480 peer reviews it has produced a reaction
00:24:36.320 i would be wrong to say that it's
00:24:37.520 universally accepted it's very much
00:24:39.520 challenged but it's intriguing what is
00:24:41.679 the challenge the challenge
00:24:42.720 fundamentally comes from we
00:24:44.559 archaeologists know that there were no
00:24:46.880 human beings in the americas that far
00:24:48.480 back to put it in perspective it's about
00:24:50.640 60 000 years before the first evidence
00:24:52.799 of human beings in europe uh it's about
00:24:55.600 60 000 years before the first evidence
00:24:57.760 of human beings in australia and this is
00:24:59.760 just evidence of the first human beings
00:25:01.600 yes we have to point out how difficult
00:25:02.880 it is to find evidence it's extremely
00:25:04.720 difficult to find you know sometimes we
00:25:06.559 imagine that archaeologists are working
00:25:08.080 with masses of skeletal material no
00:25:10.159 they're not then they're not i mean the
00:25:11.760 whole this is one of the ironies the
00:25:13.840 whole clovis first dogma you would think
00:25:16.000 that they had masses of material to work
00:25:17.760 with they did have the tools but in
00:25:19.600 terms of skeletal remains just one just
00:25:22.480 one single skeletal remain now
00:25:25.760 one of the things that michael shermer
00:25:27.039 had sent me was this uh dispute that
00:25:30.000 perhaps the bones had been cracked open
00:25:32.400 by the excavation material yeah other
00:25:34.640 excavation machines i saw michael's
00:25:37.440 email email last night and i appreciate
00:25:39.600 that michael wants to continue to uh en
00:25:42.080 engage with this subject and that's his
00:25:43.679 job he's a he's a professional skeptic
00:25:45.600 and and it's his his role to do so but
00:25:47.440 what he what he misses out it's true
00:25:49.440 that a new paper has been published
00:25:51.279 which raises questions over
00:25:53.760 the uh what's called the saruti mastodon
00:25:56.559 site which is the site that tom demare
00:25:58.400 at san diego natural history museum
00:26:00.480 excavated and what's interesting
00:26:03.919 since i can
00:26:05.039 since michael took the trouble to write
00:26:06.640 the questions can i just sure can i just
00:26:10.080 read you something that i responded to
00:26:12.400 on this sure um which is that's the
00:26:15.120 microphone though yeah yeah
00:26:17.120 basically this this this paper
00:26:19.840 um was
00:26:21.840 in no way a refutation of the original
00:26:25.120 paper in nature as a matter of fact
00:26:27.679 the gentleman who wrote that paper never
00:26:30.559 even looked at the archaeological
00:26:32.480 remains that are in now in the san diego
00:26:35.440 natural history museum
00:26:38.240 what it is what he based it on is
00:26:41.039 reference i'm quoting from the abstract
00:26:43.360 of the paper itself
00:26:45.520 reference to a freeway right of way map
00:26:48.159 and construction plans contemporary road
00:26:50.960 building practices and worksite
00:26:53.120 photographs available on the internet in
00:26:55.440 other words the site was not visited
00:26:57.279 they simply looked at secondary
00:26:58.720 references they did not look at the
00:27:00.400 archaeological material and they ignored
00:27:02.640 the entire argument of tom demere and
00:27:04.720 his colleagues who had already addressed
00:27:06.720 that issue they didn't look at the bones
00:27:08.320 they did not look at the bones when you
00:27:10.880 when you break a fresh bone it has a
00:27:13.360 characteristic kind of spiral fracture
00:27:16.000 that does not happen when you break a
00:27:17.760 fossilized bone and tom demaray and his
00:27:19.840 team specifically ruled out road making
00:27:22.720 machinery as responsible for this
00:27:24.480 breaking pattern because they actually
00:27:26.240 carried out experiments on uh modern
00:27:28.960 elephants deceased elephants and they
00:27:30.880 broke their bones and the kind of
00:27:32.400 fracture that you get in a fresh green
00:27:34.640 bone is completely different from the
00:27:36.640 kind of fletcher you get in a in a
00:27:38.240 fossilized bone so unfortunately this
00:27:40.559 paper pays pays no attention to that it
00:27:42.480 just looks at road plans and says there
00:27:44.000 was road work there it must have been
00:27:45.200 done by road work i think it's very
00:27:46.640 sloppy very weak and it's certainly not
00:27:49.200 the answer we can expect ongoing debate
00:27:51.520 and that is that is healthy but this is
00:27:53.919 not a strong case at all so this points
00:27:56.000 to the first evidence that we found and
00:27:59.360 is there any effort underway to try to
00:28:01.600 uncover more evidence that uh from a
00:28:03.840 similar time well i'm i'm going to cite
00:28:06.240 tom tom demerit the chief paleontologist
00:28:08.240 at the san diego national history museum
00:28:10.159 that's what he would like to see he
00:28:12.159 makes the point to me i interview him i
00:28:13.919 i spent a day with him at the national
00:28:15.600 history museum he was very generous with
00:28:16.960 his time i did an extended interview and
00:28:18.880 i quote from it in in america uh before
00:28:21.840 and his wish is that archaeologists
00:28:24.320 instead of spending all their time
00:28:26.240 trying to find ways to dismiss and get
00:28:28.640 rid of his findings his wish is that
00:28:31.039 they would spend a little bit of that
00:28:32.559 time looking at deposits older than 13
00:28:36.080 400 years and even being willing to go
00:28:38.320 back as far as 130 000 years that's
00:28:41.760 that's would be a proper scientific
00:28:43.760 response here is a thorough body of work
00:28:46.480 put forward by a very
00:28:48.720 senior group of scientists who hesitated
00:28:50.880 before they published it they had the
00:28:52.399 information back in the 1990s but it
00:28:54.080 wasn't until refined dating techniques
00:28:57.039 later than in in the 21st century that
00:28:59.440 they finally were sure what they had and
00:29:01.520 that they published it in in nature in
00:29:03.279 2017. it's uh it's it's a it's an
00:29:06.159 important study and and i think what's
00:29:09.039 going to happen
00:29:10.240 uh is that we're going to find much more
00:29:12.080 evidence of a very ancient human
00:29:14.159 presence in the america americas and
00:29:16.080 that's what tom demery thinks as well
00:29:18.559 and as he points out if we don't look
00:29:21.120 then we're never going to find if we
00:29:22.480 allow dogma to stop us looking and
00:29:24.240 saying oh it's impossible that humans
00:29:26.159 were in the americas 130 000 years ago
00:29:28.159 so we won't bother to look what a
00:29:29.520 failure of science that is and and and
00:29:31.760 to spend all the time instead trying to
00:29:33.840 get rid of the evidence that that
00:29:35.840 doesn't fit the current paradigm well
00:29:37.520 it's so fascinating that just as
00:29:38.880 fortuitous discovery during a
00:29:40.640 construction site could change the way
00:29:42.640 people perceive things you just you've
00:29:44.480 got to wonder how much of that stuff is
00:29:46.799 under i mean how deep did they have to
00:29:48.080 go to find these mastodon bones well so
00:29:50.000 this is a this is a road cut that's
00:29:52.000 being made so those would be those would
00:29:53.279 be pretty deep down 10 15 feet down the
00:29:56.080 grader is going through and and
00:29:58.320 flattening them it varies from place to
00:30:00.480 place depending on on soil deposition
00:30:02.399 the stratification the stratification of
00:30:04.240 the soil but what the key the key point
00:30:06.720 is that what you need to do is go deeper
00:30:09.039 than thirteen thousand four hundred
00:30:10.320 years ago and you need to do so with um
00:30:12.559 dedication and vigor uh and and with
00:30:15.279 some kind of funding and at the moment
00:30:17.360 archaeology doesn't uh doesn't see the
00:30:19.600 point of that if um the paper in nature
00:30:23.600 by tom demaray was alone if there were
00:30:26.399 nothing else than that
00:30:28.320 uh i wouldn't place so much trust in it
00:30:30.880 but i've spent a lot of time during the
00:30:32.640 researching of this book with
00:30:33.840 archaeologists who dig did
00:30:35.930 [Music]
00:30:37.520 did dig deeper and what those
00:30:40.399 archaeologists all confirm is that there
00:30:42.559 have been human beings in the americas
00:30:44.240 for tens of thousands of years and it's
00:30:46.559 not surprising that that can be pushed
00:30:48.720 back to 130 thousand years ago because
00:30:51.039 part of the argument about the people of
00:30:52.720 the americas has to do with a place that
00:30:54.559 we now call the bering straits between
00:30:57.840 alaska and siberia which during the ice
00:31:01.520 age were
00:31:03.039 at times a land bridge they were exposed
00:31:06.159 because of because of lowered sea levels
00:31:08.480 but
00:31:09.360 migrants who crossed that land bridge
00:31:11.200 from siberia on many occasions over
00:31:14.399 periods of tens of thousands of years
00:31:15.919 would find themselves confronted then by
00:31:18.320 the north american ice cap which oddly
00:31:20.240 wasn't at the tip of alaska but began
00:31:22.240 further in so there was living space in
00:31:24.399 a bit of alaska but you couldn't get
00:31:26.080 through the ice mountains these these
00:31:27.840 literally ice mountains two two miles
00:31:30.240 deep covering the whole of north america
00:31:32.399 and preventing access to the unglaciated
00:31:36.320 parts of america the thing is that
00:31:39.360 what happened around 13 400 years ago
00:31:42.399 there had been a period of global
00:31:43.840 warming and the ice sheets began to melt
00:31:46.000 and a corridor opened up between what's
00:31:48.080 called the cordillera and ice sheet and
00:31:49.760 the laurentide ice sheet the two major
00:31:51.440 ice cubes in north america and it's
00:31:53.360 thought that migration came through that
00:31:55.200 corridor well the thing is that exactly
00:31:57.679 the same thing happened between 140 000
00:32:00.559 years ago and 120 000 years ago there
00:32:02.880 was an episode of global warming an ice
00:32:04.960 free corridor opened up and the same
00:32:06.880 opportunity to enter the americas was
00:32:08.640 there at that period than it was at the
00:32:10.720 later period and tom demery's point in
00:32:13.200 mind is that we have to pay much more
00:32:14.799 attention to that earlier period and
00:32:16.960 that's
00:32:17.760 really why i've gone ahead and uh and
00:32:20.480 written this book is to try to put
00:32:22.880 before
00:32:23.919 a a broad general audience hopefully in
00:32:27.200 language that that makes sense and an
00:32:29.440 assembly of all the latest information
00:32:31.919 that casts doubt on the story we've been
00:32:33.919 told because my goodness if archaeology
00:32:36.640 is wrong about the story of the peopling
00:32:39.200 of the americas if it's radically wrong
00:32:41.519 as it now appears to be
00:32:43.519 then our whole understanding of human
00:32:45.360 history has to change it's not just the
00:32:47.360 history of the americas it's the history
00:32:49.360 of the entire world it has been
00:32:51.840 an absolute article of faith amongst
00:32:54.240 archaeologists that civilization began
00:32:56.720 in the old world
00:32:58.880 and
00:33:00.320 indeed i have a i have a book in my my
00:33:02.320 library called history begins at sumer
00:33:05.600 and it's by samuel noah cramer a very
00:33:07.919 renowned archaeologist
00:33:09.840 and it's a good book actually but the
00:33:11.840 argument is that this is where
00:33:13.840 civilization began in the culture that
00:33:16.000 we call the sumerians in mesopotamia
00:33:18.159 between the tigris and the euphrates
00:33:19.679 rivers and that it began about 6000
00:33:22.480 years ago and that civilization is
00:33:24.080 entirely an invention of the old world
00:33:26.720 and has nothing to do with the new world
00:33:28.799 at all because the new world was
00:33:30.399 populated so late this is this has been
00:33:33.279 the this has been the argument and this
00:33:35.120 is the argument that now radically and
00:33:37.440 suddenly begins to change that the
00:33:39.679 americas this enormous landmass resource
00:33:42.399 rich
00:33:43.600 bountiful in in every way
00:33:46.320 south of minnesota south of the ice cap
00:33:49.120 vast land areas that are that are
00:33:50.799 bountiful get into south america central
00:33:52.480 america south america the amazon just
00:33:54.640 huge areas of land that were very very
00:33:57.600 offered great potential for for human
00:33:59.679 occupation dogma has said there were no
00:34:01.919 humans there now the first bits of
00:34:03.919 evidence are coming out that says there
00:34:05.679 were humans there and if that's the case
00:34:08.239 then we must consider the possibility
00:34:09.918 that the story of civilization might
00:34:11.679 have begun in the americas not in the
00:34:13.199 old world at all it might be a new world
00:34:15.599 invention not an old world invention
00:34:17.440 some of the more fascinating pieces of
00:34:19.520 evidence in south america have come out
00:34:21.280 recently about these uh channels and
00:34:24.159 pathways that they've found in the
00:34:25.679 amazon that could not have been created
00:34:28.000 any other way but by humans absolutely
00:34:30.560 creating irrigation humans creating
00:34:33.280 like it appears like grids like a city
00:34:35.760 grid definitely the amazon is a colossal
00:34:38.719 mystery and it's one of the subjects
00:34:40.960 that i explore in depth in america
00:34:43.040 before
00:34:44.159 first of all to give some basic figures
00:34:46.000 the amazon basin is huge the amazon
00:34:48.960 basin is seven million square kilometers
00:34:52.719 in area
00:34:54.159 um and within it five and a half million
00:34:56.879 square kilometers
00:34:58.400 uh remains almost entirely unstudied by
00:35:01.760 archaeologists and that's the five and a
00:35:03.440 half million square kilometers that is
00:35:05.119 still covered by dense rainforest and to
00:35:07.760 put that into perspective five and a
00:35:09.680 half million square kilometers is the
00:35:11.520 size of the entire indian subcontinent
00:35:14.400 so it's like saying we've done world
00:35:16.880 archaeology but we've just ignored india
00:35:19.119 you know
00:35:20.560 we've done world archaeology but we've
00:35:22.000 just ignored the amazon it's the same
00:35:23.920 the same migrant five and a half million
00:35:25.440 square kilometers the view was again
00:35:27.200 there was a dogma there was a
00:35:28.560 preconception human beings couldn't have
00:35:31.119 flourished in the amazon it's a
00:35:33.760 it's not a resource-rich area the soils
00:35:36.079 are poor um it's a difficult area
00:35:38.480 challenging to get to very far from the
00:35:40.480 bering straits so the view was that
00:35:42.800 humans hadn't entered the amazon until
00:35:44.480 about a thousand years ago
00:35:47.200 and then gradually little by little that
00:35:49.359 view has begun to change and it's begun
00:35:50.960 to change because of the tragic
00:35:53.520 clearances of the amazon because the
00:35:55.119 amazon rainforest is literally being cut
00:35:57.359 down and turned into soya bean farms and
00:36:00.880 and cattle ranches and in that cutting
00:36:02.640 down process has emerged things that
00:36:05.280 shouldn't be there at all
00:36:07.440 for example evidence that large cities
00:36:09.920 flourished in the emerson
00:36:11.599 enormous cities which were larger
00:36:13.920 than the there was a spanish explorer
00:36:16.000 who went down the amazon river system in
00:36:17.680 1541 to 1542 he was the first european
00:36:20.880 to cross the entire length of south
00:36:22.560 america from west to east
00:36:25.119 along the amazon he reported seeing
00:36:27.680 incredible cities advanced arts and
00:36:29.839 crafts millions of people a thriving
00:36:32.640 culture
00:36:33.839 and a hundred years later when other
00:36:35.440 europeans got into the amazon they
00:36:36.800 couldn't find these cities so they said
00:36:38.720 oh francisco orianna that was his name
00:36:40.880 made it all up it was just a it was just
00:36:42.720 a fantasy and then in the last decade as
00:36:45.200 the clearances of the amazon have
00:36:46.640 proceeded we've begun to see the traces
00:36:48.640 of those cities what happened was that
00:36:50.960 the spaniards brought smallpox into the
00:36:53.520 amazon smallpox
00:36:55.520 devastated the local population because
00:36:57.440 there was no immunity to it there was a
00:36:59.280 massive die-off the cities were deserted
00:37:01.760 within a 50 years they were completely
00:37:03.760 overgrown by the jungle and that's why
00:37:05.440 they were not seen by the explorers who
00:37:07.599 came in 100 years later but now the
00:37:09.040 jungle is being cleared those cities are
00:37:10.800 emerging and we can say that uh a city
00:37:13.040 like london which had a population of
00:37:14.640 roughly 50 000 in the 16th century there
00:37:17.200 were cities of that size all over the
00:37:18.800 amazon
00:37:19.839 huge numbers of them and a possible
00:37:22.880 total population of the amazon that
00:37:24.320 exceeded 20 million people what yes 20
00:37:27.599 million this is the the latest evidence
00:37:29.680 from the amazon and then you ask
00:37:30.960 yourself how did they do that how did
00:37:32.640 they feed 20 million people in the
00:37:34.720 amazon because it's a fact rainforest
00:37:36.800 soils are poor it's one of the reasons
00:37:38.880 these soya bean farms are a really
00:37:40.240 stupid idea because once you clear the
00:37:42.079 rainforest the land is largely unfertile
00:37:44.480 and you can't grow stuff on it for very
00:37:46.800 long so how did they feed all these
00:37:48.320 people the answer was
00:37:50.560 they invented a soil
00:37:52.480 and that soil has a name it's called
00:37:54.720 terra prata archaeologists refer to it
00:37:57.040 as amazonian dark earths or amazonian
00:37:59.359 black earth it's a man-made soil it's
00:38:02.160 thousands of years old it's full of
00:38:04.240 microbes that are not found in adjoining
00:38:06.720 soil it's based around biochar
00:38:10.079 and you can take a handful of eight
00:38:12.079 thousand year old terraprater and you
00:38:14.240 can add it to barren soil and that soil
00:38:16.640 will instantly become fertile it's
00:38:19.119 highly sought after in the amazon and it
00:38:20.960 explains how they fed these people there
00:38:22.640 was science in the atmosphere how did
00:38:24.000 they create this well this is something
00:38:25.680 that's not understood it's still not
00:38:27.359 understood by soul experts to this day
00:38:29.280 as to how that was done but it's one of
00:38:30.960 many intriguing evidences pieces of
00:38:33.119 evidence of much higher
00:38:34.960 uh development in the amazon that it has
00:38:37.680 been given credit for and of a kind of
00:38:40.079 science india jamie's got an image of it
00:38:41.920 up there so this is it this is terrapin
00:38:44.000 yeah yeah wow exactly and so was that
00:38:46.320 done by burns did they use controlled
00:38:48.480 burns they did they
00:38:50.480 one way that it was achieved was uh was
00:38:53.119 to do wet burning um of middens they
00:38:56.240 would be they would be burned and
00:38:57.760 smolder they wouldn't burn fiercely
00:38:59.680 which just produces charcoal they would
00:39:01.119 they would burn and smolder
00:39:03.200 and and that
00:39:04.720 what is called biochar would result and
00:39:06.880 that's part of the fertility of the soil
00:39:08.480 but the mystery is the microbial content
00:39:11.040 of this soil which is completely
00:39:12.480 different from the microbes in
00:39:14.160 neighboring soils and that's remains
00:39:16.000 unexplained so do they what are the
00:39:18.320 theories composting some sort of
00:39:19.920 advanced composting some sort of some
00:39:21.680 sort of advanced composting but again
00:39:23.920 what has not been explained is that is
00:39:25.680 the microbial
00:39:27.359 content of these soils so there there
00:39:29.119 first of all is an issue of how uh two
00:39:32.000 things how large populations get fed in
00:39:34.560 the amazon and evidence that there was a
00:39:37.040 culture in the amazon that was capable
00:39:38.880 of manipulating the environment in such
00:39:41.280 a way that it could support large
00:39:42.880 populations with the invention of terra
00:39:44.480 prata secondly new evidence previously
00:39:47.280 not recognized the amazon is basically a
00:39:49.200 garden the amazon is a man-made
00:39:51.599 rainforest
00:39:53.359 there are certain trees like brazil nut
00:39:55.680 trees or the ice cream bean tree which
00:39:58.079 are food crops which are very very
00:40:00.160 valuable and they dominate the uh
00:40:03.119 the tree regime in in the amazon they're
00:40:05.200 what's what's referred to as hyper
00:40:06.400 dominant species in other words people
00:40:08.880 living in the amazon over thousands of
00:40:10.640 years selected certain trees which they
00:40:13.359 then cultivated and grew so the whole
00:40:15.520 thing is not
00:40:16.800 simply a wild pristine rainforest it's a
00:40:19.119 very ancient man-made environment and
00:40:21.920 emerging from that man-made environment
00:40:23.839 as well as evidence of large cities
00:40:25.920 large populations and this mysterious
00:40:28.480 dark earth
00:40:30.160 are
00:40:31.040 huge geometrical structures
00:40:33.839 and again i go into this at length in
00:40:35.599 america before because i love this
00:40:37.280 mystery
00:40:39.040 we have in the uk structures that are
00:40:41.440 called henges um i live in the city of
00:40:44.000 bath and about 30 miles away there's a
00:40:46.400 beautiful
00:40:47.440 site called avebury and another more
00:40:49.920 famous site called stonehenge and what a
00:40:52.480 henge is
00:40:54.079 is a
00:40:55.280 ditch
00:40:56.160 which has been dug deep and then an
00:40:57.920 embankment has been pushed up outside
00:40:59.760 the ditch when people first saw these
00:41:01.680 structures they wondered if they'd been
00:41:03.040 built for defense but then it became
00:41:05.200 obvious they hadn't been built for
00:41:06.480 defense because if you want uh to create
00:41:09.280 a moat you put it outside your
00:41:11.280 embankment not inside your embankment so
00:41:14.160 a henge is an earthwork which consists
00:41:16.319 of a deep moat with a large embankment
00:41:18.720 outside it can be circular it can be
00:41:21.040 square and in the uk and other parts of
00:41:23.040 europe it often contains stone circles
00:41:25.119 megalithic stone circles as well but the
00:41:27.280 hinge itself is entirely an earthwork
00:41:29.520 what we find in the amazon are thousands
00:41:32.400 of henges that are now beginning to
00:41:34.640 emerge from the cleared area of the
00:41:36.160 jungle and others that have been
00:41:37.599 identified for the first time with lidar
00:41:39.920 lidar technology is being employed in
00:41:41.680 the amazon it's non-destructive you can
00:41:43.680 see what's under the trees what is lidar
00:41:46.240 light imaging and detective radar they
00:41:48.400 bounce laser beams down into the jungles
00:41:50.400 a whole pattern of them you need
00:41:51.680 helicopters and they but it doesn't
00:41:53.440 damage the rainforest and you can strip
00:41:55.599 away and see what's see what's there if
00:41:57.599 this isn't too much of a diversion let
00:41:59.119 me give you the example of guatemala
00:42:01.520 guatemala is a small country if i
00:42:03.760 remember correctly it's not much more
00:42:05.200 than a hundred thousand square
00:42:06.640 kilometers in size
00:42:08.640 it is filled with intriguing mayan ruins
00:42:11.839 everybody has heard of tikal
00:42:14.480 what archaeologists didn't know was that
00:42:16.319 literally within walking distance of
00:42:18.000 tikal
00:42:19.839 surrounding that whole area were more
00:42:21.520 than 60 000 structures that they hadn't
00:42:23.599 identified and these have all been
00:42:25.280 identified by lidar in a country that's
00:42:28.079 just a hundred thousand kilometers in
00:42:29.760 area
00:42:30.560 so you have to ask yourself in that five
00:42:32.880 and a half million square kilometers of
00:42:34.880 the amazon if lidar technology could be
00:42:37.040 applied comprehensively what would we
00:42:39.680 find beneath there and the evidence
00:42:42.480 already is extremely tempting and
00:42:44.400 extremely tantalizing and i'm intrigued
00:42:47.359 by these huge geometrical figures
00:42:50.319 which involve primarily
00:42:52.880 circles and squares and they are classic
00:42:56.000 henges in the sense that they are deep
00:42:57.760 ditches surrounded by huge embankments
00:43:01.119 they're
00:43:02.000 extremely geometrical for example you
00:43:03.839 can find an octagon surrounding a square
00:43:06.800 at a place called jacosa in the amazon
00:43:09.200 you can find a square
00:43:11.359 perfectly enclosing a circle now that is
00:43:13.680 an exercise called squaring the circle
00:43:15.920 that our
00:43:17.119 our academics have given to the greeks
00:43:19.359 they said the greeks were the first
00:43:20.480 person people who performed that
00:43:21.760 exercise but now we find in dated sites
00:43:24.400 in the amazon that this was being done
00:43:25.920 in the amazon long before the greeks
00:43:27.599 what are the dates the earliest dates
00:43:29.599 that have been found in these sites now
00:43:31.359 are about three and a half thousand
00:43:32.880 years old about three and a half
00:43:34.240 thousand years old but the evidence is
00:43:36.079 that the sites have been constantly
00:43:37.599 remade and what intrigues me
00:43:40.720 is what remains in that five and a half
00:43:43.520 million square kilometers that has not
00:43:45.359 been investigated yet we are just i
00:43:47.200 think looking at the edges of a mystery
00:43:49.440 the archaeologists involved who are
00:43:50.960 mainly from finland and also from brazil
00:43:54.240 feel the same their their estimate is
00:43:56.079 that there are thousands of these
00:43:57.440 structures remaining in the jungle and
00:43:58.880 they're open as to how old they may
00:44:01.119 ultimately prove to be the investigation
00:44:04.079 needs to be done but what's fascinating
00:44:06.000 about them is this very powerful
00:44:08.720 geometry and astronomy so a number of
00:44:10.800 the sites are perfectly aligned to true
00:44:12.720 north true south true east and true west
00:44:15.359 i'm not talking about magnetic north i'm
00:44:17.040 talking about true astronomical north to
00:44:19.200 do that there's only one way to do it
00:44:20.720 and that's with with astronomy so that
00:44:22.800 tells us that astronomers were at work
00:44:24.560 in the amazon the geometry is very
00:44:26.960 complex and very precise that tells us
00:44:29.200 that people with geometrical skills were
00:44:30.960 at work in the amazon and thirdly the
00:44:32.800 scale of the sites of hundreds of meters
00:44:35.040 gigantic earthworks on the scale of
00:44:36.640 hundreds of meters tells us that this
00:44:38.720 was highly organized uh project that was
00:44:41.040 undertaken on a very large scale by very
00:44:43.440 large numbers of people it's a wonderful
00:44:45.280 mystery and and it deserves
00:44:47.839 much further much further attention and
00:44:49.839 i'm i'm yeah that's jacob exactly the
00:44:52.240 square
00:44:53.040 squaring the circle so you can see the
00:44:55.040 the outside embankment and then inside
00:44:57.599 it is the square ditch and then there's
00:44:59.760 another embankment inside that and a
00:45:01.520 circle and a circle inside that's crazy
00:45:03.520 that they made a road right through that
00:45:05.440 modern road yeah you know because
00:45:07.119 because there's no respect for there's
00:45:08.720 no respect for the ancient for the
00:45:10.160 ancient world unfortunately
00:45:12.160 and there's another one look at that wow
00:45:13.920 wow that's incredible so that that's how
00:45:16.160 they found the the stuff that they found
00:45:18.800 in the amazon what imaging technology
00:45:20.960 were they using to find all these
00:45:22.800 initially initially it was entirely
00:45:25.440 found because areas of the rainforest
00:45:27.200 had been cleared economic interests said
00:45:29.520 we want to make a cattle ranch here or
00:45:31.200 we want to make a soya bean farm here so
00:45:33.119 we're just going to clear the rainforest
00:45:34.960 in the process of clearing the
00:45:36.079 rainforest they start discovering these
00:45:37.760 earthworks that had previously been
00:45:39.520 completely overgrown by the jungle then
00:45:42.319 the next step was to say
00:45:44.319 what can we what could we do to find out
00:45:46.400 more about this obviously they don't
00:45:48.000 want to destroy more jungle and luckily
00:45:50.720 we have a technology which is which is
00:45:52.400 lidar as i mentioned which
00:45:54.319 uses radar and using lidar they've been
00:45:56.960 identified able to identify many more of
00:45:59.520 these sites and then to get to the sites
00:46:01.839 without destroying the jungle and to
00:46:04.400 begin excavations on them and to find
00:46:06.560 that they go back in the cases of the
00:46:08.560 ones that have been explored so far at
00:46:10.720 least 3000 years
00:46:12.800 this is an intriguing development
00:46:15.040 completely unexplained in our
00:46:16.880 understanding of the amazon and what it
00:46:18.319 suggests is a heritage
00:46:20.640 of extremely ancient knowledge you don't
00:46:22.800 wake up one morning and you know create
00:46:24.640 a perfectly geometrical square or
00:46:27.119 circular earthwork that's perfectly
00:46:29.040 aligned to true north south east and
00:46:30.560 west on an enormous scale there has to
00:46:32.800 be a background to that there has to be
00:46:34.160 a reason for doing it and the evidence
00:46:35.520 is none of these sites were lived in
00:46:36.880 there's no habitation uh refuse found in
00:46:39.920 them whatsoever they were they we don't
00:46:42.560 know what they were used for i make the
00:46:45.119 case uh in america before that they're
00:46:47.920 connected to a system of ideas which is
00:46:50.319 found all around the world which which
00:46:52.640 is to do with death
00:46:54.160 and the afterlife destiny
00:46:56.640 of the soul
00:46:58.000 uh and i go into the issue of ayahuasca
00:47:00.400 uh in in this book because um first of
00:47:03.119 all ayahuasca is itself another example
00:47:05.839 of amazonian science um as you and i and
00:47:09.440 many of the the listeners and viewers
00:47:11.520 know
00:47:12.319 uh the active ingredient of ayahuasca is
00:47:14.560 dmt uh dimethyltryptamine
00:47:17.359 but dimethyltryptamine is not normally
00:47:20.560 accessible through the gut
00:47:22.240 uh we have to smoke it or or vape it to
00:47:24.720 get that rocket ship to the other side
00:47:27.280 of reality
00:47:28.560 and the journey lasts what 10 12 minutes
00:47:31.520 not much more than that and sometimes
00:47:32.960 sometimes quite a lot less
00:47:35.599 what ayahuasca does is it makes dmt
00:47:38.160 available through the gut the reason
00:47:40.079 it's not available through the gut is
00:47:41.599 because of an enzyme in the gut called
00:47:43.200 monoamine oxidase and that switches off
00:47:45.680 dmt on contact the ayahuasca vine which
00:47:49.440 is one of the two ingredients of the
00:47:50.800 ayahuasca brew the other ingredient is
00:47:52.800 leaves that contain dmt the ayahuasca
00:47:55.520 vine contains a monoamine oxidase
00:47:57.599 inhibitor which switches off the enzyme
00:48:00.640 in the gut and allows the dmt to be
00:48:02.880 accessed orally which produces a rather
00:48:05.599 different journey from the smoked or
00:48:07.599 vaped dmt trip it's a much longer
00:48:09.599 journey it's four or five hours it
00:48:11.200 allows you to integrate and to and to
00:48:13.119 interrelate with the strange landscapes
00:48:15.200 in which you find yourself amongst and
00:48:17.119 the entities that you encounter i'm not
00:48:19.119 making any claims about the reality
00:48:20.720 status of those entities but what i am
00:48:22.400 saying and it's a fact is that people
00:48:24.400 who work with dmt in ayahuasca do
00:48:26.480 encounter what they construe to be
00:48:28.319 entities uh who who communicate with
00:48:30.400 them intelligently so somebody in the
00:48:32.880 amazon out of 150 000 different species
00:48:35.520 of plants and trees selected two that
00:48:38.240 are not psychoactive on their own but
00:48:40.319 when put together create an
00:48:42.319 extraordinary
00:48:44.079 visionary brew
00:48:45.599 and ayahuasca means the vine of the dead
00:48:48.640 and what it's connected to
00:48:50.720 in south american religious and
00:48:53.280 spiritual thinking
00:48:54.880 uh is what happens to us when we die
00:48:58.880 and the tucano who are an amazonian
00:49:01.440 people who work regularly with ayahuasca
00:49:04.079 i mean the tucano actually will give a
00:49:06.240 teaspoon full of ayahuasca to a newborn
00:49:08.640 infant they feel ayahuasca is so
00:49:10.480 important that there is a hidden realm
00:49:12.559 around us which we are not normally
00:49:14.400 aware of and we need to be aware of it
00:49:16.240 and and ayahuasca is an important part
00:49:18.319 of that
00:49:19.440 in their ayahuasca journeys the tukano
00:49:21.839 shamans experience visions and they will
00:49:24.079 then come back to an alert normal
00:49:26.400 problem-solving state of consciousness
00:49:27.839 and they will paint and depict their
00:49:29.440 visions and what's intriguing and i go
00:49:31.280 into it in the book is that quite a
00:49:32.480 number of the tucano paintings of the
00:49:34.400 other world of the afterlife realm of
00:49:37.280 the entrance to the other world are
00:49:38.880 geometrical and they look exactly like
00:49:41.760 the geoglyphs so i'm beginning to wonder
00:49:43.599 whether these geoglyphs were part of a
00:49:45.920 system of spiritual ideas concerning
00:49:49.200 what happens to us after death and what
00:49:51.440 we need to do in this life to ensure a
00:49:54.079 beneficial outcome and oddly enough that
00:49:56.800 same system of ideas is found in the
00:49:58.800 mississippi valley in the amazon it
00:50:01.200 involves
00:50:02.400 particularly ayahuasca and the belief
00:50:04.480 that the ayahuasca journey takes you to
00:50:06.160 the afterlife realm and a journey along
00:50:08.160 the milky way in the mississippi valley
00:50:11.839 the mound builder sites up and down the
00:50:13.599 mississippi valley particularly
00:50:15.119 moundville in alabama exactly the same
00:50:18.240 system of religious ideas associated
00:50:20.400 with geometrical constructions that on
00:50:22.880 death the soul they're very specific
00:50:25.200 ascends to the constellation of orion
00:50:27.760 transits from the constellation of orion
00:50:29.440 to the milky way makes a journey along
00:50:31.760 the milky way which they call the path
00:50:33.920 of souls and encounters challenges and
00:50:36.559 ordeals where the soul must account for
00:50:39.119 the life that it has lived
00:50:41.760 then we go to egypt and what do we find
00:50:44.240 the same system of ideas
00:50:46.640 the soul must rise up to the
00:50:48.240 constellation of orion there's a narrow
00:50:49.920 shaft cut through the southern side of
00:50:51.599 the great pyramid of giza which targets
00:50:53.760 directly the lowest of the three stars
00:50:55.359 of orion's belt
00:50:57.040 widely accepted as a star shaft or a
00:50:59.280 soul shaft the soul would rise up
00:51:01.359 through that shaft get to the
00:51:02.880 constellation of orion which stands by
00:51:04.559 the banks of the milky way it would then
00:51:06.480 transit to the milky way which the
00:51:07.920 ancient egyptians called the winding
00:51:09.359 waterway and it would make a journey
00:51:11.520 along the milky way where it would be
00:51:13.680 confronted by challenges and ordeals
00:51:15.599 very similar idea to the tucano very
00:51:17.680 similar idea to the mississippi valley
00:51:19.599 as far as we know none of these cultures
00:51:21.440 were in contact with one another either
00:51:23.599 we're dealing with a huge unbelievable
00:51:26.240 extraordinarily detailed coincidence
00:51:28.720 involving architecture and ideas or
00:51:31.920 we're looking at the legacy that was
00:51:33.599 inherited in all of these different
00:51:35.280 places from a remote common ancestor and
00:51:37.920 and i believe that that's what we're
00:51:39.040 looking at what do we think the people
00:51:40.720 from the ancient mississippi valley that
00:51:43.040 culture what do we think they were using
00:51:44.800 if they weren't using ayahuasca or do we
00:51:46.720 think that that's what they were using
00:51:48.800 well that's that's that's an interesting
00:51:51.040 question whether whether visionary
00:51:52.720 substances are the only way uh to get
00:51:55.200 into altered states of consciousness and
00:51:57.520 and uh i would say
00:51:59.359 they they are definitely not uh of
00:52:01.359 course there are visionary substances
00:52:03.040 which are which are used in native
00:52:04.640 american
00:52:05.760 vision vision quests i've i've i've had
00:52:07.599 the
00:52:08.640 privilege of
00:52:09.760 peyote ceremony uh with the native
00:52:11.839 american church um i've never done that
00:52:14.000 what does it look like i i loved it
00:52:15.680 actually i thought i thought it was i
00:52:17.200 thought it was amazing it was it doesn't
00:52:19.040 overpower you in the way that dmt or
00:52:21.119 ayahuasca does uh it's it's it's much
00:52:23.280 gentler it's much more you feel much
00:52:25.040 more integrated and connected with with
00:52:26.960 with nature your thought processes are
00:52:28.720 quite are quite clear it felt it felt
00:52:31.040 just like a very beautiful and healing
00:52:32.480 experience and i love the ceremony that
00:52:34.000 i'm in i'm inside a teepee with with 30
00:52:36.480 or 40 other people and that there are
00:52:38.160 there are specific roles that are
00:52:39.920 assigned to those different individuals
00:52:41.280 one will keep the door another will be
00:52:42.800 responsible for the fire which is a work
00:52:44.800 of art in itself just gazing into that
00:52:46.720 fire and the glowing the glowing embers
00:52:48.960 is enough to induce an altered state of
00:52:51.119 consciousness on its own incredible
00:52:53.359 drumming which which drives your state
00:52:55.680 of consciousness into a kind of peak
00:52:57.839 peak experience this is a technology for
00:53:00.559 accessing other levels of experience and
00:53:03.760 other levels of reality and it's clear
00:53:05.359 that the native americans had a number
00:53:07.520 of advanced technologies in this area
00:53:09.680 the sun dance doesn't use a substance
00:53:11.920 but it uses austerity it uses pain
00:53:14.400 to drive an altered state of
00:53:15.599 consciousness the objective in every
00:53:17.119 case seems to be
00:53:18.559 let's just for a while get ourselves out
00:53:21.280 of the narrow rigid frame of the alert
00:53:23.760 problem-solving state of consciousness
00:53:25.119 we all need that it's incredibly useful
00:53:26.960 hunter-gatherers need it just as much as
00:53:28.720 people in in cities need it but it's not
00:53:31.599 the only state of consciousness
00:53:32.880 available to human beings and maybe
00:53:34.559 that's one of the big mistakes that
00:53:35.839 we're making in our culture
00:53:38.480 and was not made in in shamanistic
00:53:41.680 societies
00:53:43.200 that that is a a really interesting
00:53:45.839 breakdown that maybe that is one of the
00:53:47.119 big mistakes we're making in our culture
00:53:48.720 when people point to the problems that
00:53:50.400 we have in this country one of the
00:53:51.680 problems we have is our inability to
00:53:53.839 connect with each other yeah or to
00:53:55.359 recognize that we're all sharing this
00:53:56.960 space and time together and instead
00:53:59.040 wanting to uphold our own
00:54:01.040 religious or ideological ideas as being
00:54:04.079 the only one way to get going yeah the
00:54:05.839 only one way to get through and one of
00:54:07.760 the things that i've found
00:54:09.440 with these psychedelic experiences it it
00:54:11.839 really makes
00:54:13.359 ideologies
00:54:15.040 seem uh if not preposterous at the very
00:54:17.599 least insignificant in comparison to
00:54:19.839 human experiences absolutely the
00:54:21.359 experience of camaraderie and friendship
00:54:24.319 and and love it you realize like oh this
00:54:27.359 is what's important this is what it is
00:54:28.720 what's important is really about not not
00:54:30.960 enforcing your ideas or
00:54:32.960 pushing them on other people and forcing
00:54:34.960 people to behave the way you behave but
00:54:36.559 instead love and think about
00:54:39.359 religious ideas which cause so much
00:54:41.359 division so much chaos so much hatred so
00:54:44.160 much fear so much suspicion in the world
00:54:46.319 today
00:54:47.520 um is it
00:54:49.200 really what we want to do as human
00:54:50.800 beings simply to accept a package of
00:54:53.040 ideas that were believed in by our
00:54:55.280 ancestors to accept them whole without
00:54:57.680 question as absolute fact which we
00:55:00.240 regard as such authoritative fact that
00:55:02.319 in some cases we're willing to be deeply
00:55:04.960 unpleasant to people who hold different
00:55:06.559 views or perhaps even kill them we've
00:55:08.960 had this you know this recent event in
00:55:10.720 in in in sri lanka
00:55:13.200 primarily a religiously motivated
00:55:15.280 terrorist event it happens it happens
00:55:17.280 all over the world people feel so
00:55:18.720 convinced that the inherited package of
00:55:21.440 ideas that they had nothing to do with
00:55:23.280 creating and that they have never
00:55:25.119 questioned they're so convinced that
00:55:27.119 those ideas are right that in extreme
00:55:28.720 cases they're actually prepared to kill
00:55:30.720 other human beings who hold different
00:55:33.119 ideas they are they so insecure in their
00:55:36.480 own in their own beliefs that that
00:55:38.400 they're prepared to go to that level of
00:55:40.160 actually murdering another human being
00:55:42.240 who else they're so threatened by the
00:55:43.839 other beliefs that other human beings
00:55:45.200 hold so it's an abnegation of our
00:55:47.280 responsibility as human beings we should
00:55:49.359 be questioning things we should not be
00:55:51.200 accepting packages of ideas intact fully
00:55:53.599 formed and using them to drive the way
00:55:56.079 we behave towards one another that was
00:55:58.319 part of the human story but we need to
00:55:59.920 move on from that and it's a very
00:56:01.680 dangerous situation in a very complex
00:56:03.520 modern world with billions of human
00:56:05.599 beings on the planet to have these kind
00:56:07.599 of energies being generated where
00:56:08.960 certain groups of people are saying we
00:56:10.559 are absolutely right and you are
00:56:12.319 absolutely wrong we are superior you are
00:56:14.960 inferior this is a very very dangerous
00:56:17.760 path that we're that we're on and it
00:56:19.520 needs to be changed
00:56:20.880 personally
00:56:22.319 i know this is not a comment that will
00:56:24.640 go down well with many people but i am
00:56:26.640 strongly opposed to nationalism i don't
00:56:29.040 i don't see any virtue in nationalism it
00:56:31.839 is an accident of birth which nation you
00:56:34.400 were born in it was nothing that you did
00:56:36.640 for your own merit you didn't earn that
00:56:38.720 you were born by accident in in a
00:56:41.440 particular nation
00:56:42.960 why should we automatically feel that
00:56:44.720 other people who were born by accident
00:56:46.480 in that particular nation have something
00:56:48.240 special in common with us and that we
00:56:49.839 together are a group who are much more
00:56:51.440 important than other groups of people
00:56:53.119 i've been privileged to spend my life
00:56:55.040 traveling around the world living with
00:56:57.040 communities all over over the world and
00:56:59.520 one thing that really comes across to me
00:57:01.599 strongly it's it should be a cliche and
00:57:03.760 yet it's not is that we are all one
00:57:06.079 family that humans are intimately
00:57:08.160 interconnected all around the world that
00:57:10.079 you can go to the remotest area of the
00:57:12.160 amazon jungle and find the same hopes
00:57:14.640 the same fears the same dreams that we
00:57:17.440 have in industrialized cities shared by
00:57:19.520 the hunter-gatherers in the in in the
00:57:21.040 middle of the amazon so our
00:57:23.359 similarities as human beings and what we
00:57:25.920 share in common at the emotional level
00:57:27.839 and the level of love and at the level
00:57:29.359 of heart are far more important than our
00:57:32.400 differences that are defined by the
00:57:34.079 nation or the political group in which
00:57:35.680 we in which we grew up in and when i
00:57:37.839 when i say i'm against nationalism i
00:57:40.079 need also to make clear that does not
00:57:42.240 mean
00:57:43.520 and i hope i'm not taken out of context
00:57:45.920 by others who are listening to this that
00:57:47.359 does not mean i'm in favor
00:57:49.440 of world government i detest governments
00:57:52.000 that's another thing we need to grow out
00:57:53.839 of we don't need governments anymore if
00:57:56.319 we have them they should have a very
00:57:57.839 minimal role
00:57:59.200 in our society i think it's possible for
00:58:00.960 the human race to relate as one family
00:58:03.359 without leaders and governments who are
00:58:05.599 exploiting the worst aspects of our
00:58:07.839 character the lowest common denominator
00:58:09.599 of our society deliberately encouraging
00:58:12.160 fears and hatreds and suspicion what
00:58:14.000 responsible leaders should be doing is
00:58:16.160 encouraging love and unity and their
00:58:19.200 failure to do that in my view
00:58:21.520 disqualifies them from the leadership
00:58:23.599 role
00:58:24.559 entirely and that's why i've often said
00:58:27.040 i would not uh i would like to see a
00:58:29.119 situation in which no head of state can
00:58:32.079 be appointed to that position unless he
00:58:34.000 or she has first had 12 sessions of
00:58:36.400 ayahuasca
00:58:37.760 that would be the condition
00:58:40.559 don't even bother applying for the job
00:58:42.799 if you haven't done this and we have to
00:58:44.319 be there while you have it and we have
00:58:45.760 to be we want to see that you're
00:58:47.520 drinking every drop
00:58:49.599 and we want an experienced shaman
00:58:51.440 present who's really going to guide you
00:58:53.119 through the through the journey and i
00:58:54.480 suspect that that would be a
00:58:55.680 transformative experience for many of
00:58:58.160 our political class and that they would
00:58:59.839 start to question why they do what they
00:59:02.240 do why they exploit fears in order to
00:59:04.799 magnify their own position they'd start
00:59:06.400 to question that and to wonder about a
00:59:08.160 different destiny for humanity but
00:59:09.520 that's a dream i guess it's not going to
00:59:10.960 happen it's very very very well said and
00:59:13.280 i couldn't agree more my hope is that
00:59:15.440 what you were saying and what we were
00:59:16.799 discussing earlier about how the
00:59:18.000 internet has sort of eroded our faith in
00:59:20.799 many institutions as being the
00:59:23.440 only or the primary source of knowledge
00:59:26.000 that i hope that that takes place
00:59:28.559 globally in terms of the way we view
00:59:30.480 government yeah and that we do
00:59:32.799 your idea of like i love what america
00:59:35.119 stands for and what america stands for
00:59:37.280 is kind of a nation that's
00:59:40.319 where people go to you know this is one
00:59:42.559 of the more insidious problems with this
00:59:46.000 idea of building walls and keeping
00:59:48.079 people out making it incredibly
00:59:49.359 difficult to get here
00:59:51.200 the reason why i'm here is because it
00:59:53.119 was pretty easy to get here yeah that's
00:59:54.960 why i'm here
00:59:56.319 that's the essence of america a free and
00:59:58.240 open society come here and do better yes
01:00:00.319 that's the whole idea behind it and i
01:00:02.400 would hope that this idea of being able
01:00:05.599 to just if you want to do better you can
01:00:09.440 anywhere in the world yeah this could
01:00:11.040 eventually spread out that's this is
01:00:13.839 my hope i believe it can spread out and
01:00:15.680 and um you know i see many signs of hope
01:00:19.119 uh in in in america
01:00:21.440 uh america has become a big part of my
01:00:23.599 life not just because i wrote this book
01:00:25.839 but because i have children who are now
01:00:28.480 living in america i have a son and
01:00:29.920 daughter-in-law who who live in la i
01:00:32.000 have another son and daughter-in-law who
01:00:34.000 live in boston america i'm i'm british
01:00:36.400 but america has become a very central
01:00:38.319 part of my life and it's a fascinating
01:00:40.079 and amazing country and it's been my
01:00:41.599 privilege to travel thousands of miles
01:00:43.920 across america across many many many
01:00:45.680 different states and i i love this
01:00:47.359 country it's a it's an amazing place
01:00:50.000 only in america could we see
01:00:53.200 happening what has happened with
01:00:54.400 cannabis you know the the fact that at a
01:00:57.680 local level individuals have got
01:00:59.920 together mobilized petitions organized
01:01:02.720 votes and changed the law
01:01:05.520 changed the law def literally stuck a
01:01:07.920 finger up at central government and said
01:01:10.000 [ __ ] off this is none of your business
01:01:12.559 what i do with my consciousness in the
01:01:14.400 inner sanctum of my own life is not the
01:01:16.640 business of the state that's a very
01:01:18.240 american feeling it's it's something
01:01:20.079 that you don't find often in other
01:01:21.599 countries where the state is granted
01:01:23.119 much more power and much more authority
01:01:25.680 than it perhaps should be americans are
01:01:27.440 naturally questioning of government
01:01:30.000 authority and that has that is what has
01:01:32.400 led to the uh legalization increasing
01:01:35.520 legalization of cannabis which is going
01:01:37.200 to change the world in lots of ways but
01:01:39.280 then ironically at the same time
01:01:42.480 see the thing about
01:01:43.760 democracies
01:01:45.119 is that
01:01:46.559 in order to
01:01:48.799 get things done in a democracy you need
01:01:50.880 to persuade people of your point of view
01:01:52.880 so information becomes very important in
01:01:55.440 in democracies and information can be
01:01:57.119 abused people can be misled with
01:01:59.200 information they can be
01:02:01.040 told that what they're receiving is the
01:02:02.559 truth whereas in fact it's not the truth
01:02:04.799 and you can end up with a kind of
01:02:06.319 dictatorship that the people have given
01:02:08.240 their ascent to on the basis of of false
01:02:10.559 information and frankly i'd rather have
01:02:12.000 a real dictatorship which is which is
01:02:13.760 out in the open and clear rather than
01:02:16.400 one that has been subtly manipulated
01:02:18.400 into position through manipulating the
01:02:21.040 the the views of the of of the voters
01:02:23.760 but i am
01:02:25.119 and remain enormously encouraged by
01:02:27.680 america it may seem like a trivial issue
01:02:30.000 but the fact that state by state
01:02:32.000 cannabis is being legalized and that is
01:02:34.160 resulting from a grassroots movement
01:02:36.799 that this enormous change has been made
01:02:38.960 it's ironic it's strange that at the
01:02:40.640 federal level even though what eight
01:02:42.720 states now totally legal for
01:02:44.160 recreational uh 23 24 states legal for
01:02:47.920 for medical use that at the federal
01:02:49.359 level it's still a schedule one control
01:02:50.960 control drug this is a huge state of
01:02:53.520 dissonance that exists and america is
01:02:55.200 going to have to put it right what it
01:02:56.960 says to me is that people can change
01:02:59.119 things people can get together at the
01:03:00.799 local level and they can make a better
01:03:02.880 world because there's no doubt that the
01:03:04.160 cannabis laws were vicious and wrong and
01:03:06.079 cruel and evil and ruined people's lives
01:03:09.040 for for decades
01:03:10.960 and it's people who've changed that it's
01:03:12.559 not government has changed that it's the
01:03:13.920 people at the grassroots level america's
01:03:15.359 a country where that can happen and i i
01:03:17.520 i remain encouraged about about the role
01:03:20.160 of the american people while often in
01:03:22.079 despair about the role of the american
01:03:24.240 state yeah i'm encouraged as well and
01:03:26.160 you know it's interesting ben and jerry
01:03:27.599 released something yesterday which is
01:03:29.280 really on 4 20 i should say which was uh
01:03:32.720 talking about the drug laws in this
01:03:35.119 country and and talking about how many
01:03:38.319 it's really really opening this the the
01:03:41.119 idea of like how unjust these laws were
01:03:43.599 and how many of these laws targeted
01:03:45.280 people of color and how many people who
01:03:47.680 are white people have profited off of
01:03:49.920 this and how many people are still in
01:03:52.400 jail
01:03:53.520 for for crimes that they committed you
01:03:55.599 know
01:03:56.240 air quote crimes yeah that are no longer
01:03:58.240 crimes that are no longer crimes yeah
01:03:59.760 and this is ridiculous these these
01:04:02.160 records should be expunged they should
01:04:03.599 be completely responsible i see that
01:04:05.039 california has made some steps in that
01:04:06.720 direction there has been some expunging
01:04:08.160 of records well we can only hope that
01:04:10.079 also what opens up next is psilocybin is
01:04:13.760 now going to be on the ballot absolutely
01:04:15.520 and when that opens up i mean what you
01:04:17.599 really think marijuana is a gateway drug
01:04:19.280 well guess what it is if psilocybin gets
01:04:21.760 in yes because psilocybin can
01:04:23.520 legitimately change the world certainly
01:04:25.839 it really i mean i think marijuana can
01:04:27.680 change the world and i really do think
01:04:28.960 that cannabis is changing people's
01:04:30.880 perceptions and making people more calm
01:04:33.359 and friendly and yeah and even the what
01:04:35.680 they talk about with paranoia i welcome
01:04:38.400 that and the reason why i welcome that
01:04:40.319 is i think people are entirely too cocky
01:04:42.400 yeah the the life we live as bizarre as
01:04:45.359 you could ever imagine in a book and
01:04:47.359 we're just accustomed to it because it's
01:04:48.960 our day to day take it all for granted
01:04:50.720 yeah marijuana removes those blinders
01:04:52.880 and it really makes you understand that
01:04:55.599 this is a strange strange life and these
01:04:59.039 a lot of these
01:05:00.400 pitfalls and problems that we have in
01:05:02.319 our society are due to fear and they're
01:05:04.400 due to the ignorance and they're they're
01:05:06.480 due to this this lack of connection with
01:05:08.720 each other and cannabis and many of
01:05:10.640 these other psychedelic drugs they
01:05:12.720 encourage this connection with each
01:05:14.319 other which is i think what we need it's
01:05:16.559 it's certainly what we need and and it's
01:05:18.720 an aberration in human culture that
01:05:20.400 we've created a society that demonized
01:05:22.640 these substances and made them illegal
01:05:24.720 it's a relatively recent thing it's
01:05:26.160 really just the last the last hundred
01:05:27.599 years it's a it's a tiny part of the
01:05:30.000 human story and yet we were so arrogant
01:05:32.000 as a society that we could set aside
01:05:34.400 thousands of years of human tradition
01:05:36.640 and experience and wisdom working with
01:05:38.400 the plant medicines we just set it aside
01:05:40.880 turn them into criminal substances and
01:05:42.880 say we know everything what a what a
01:05:44.720 huge and stupid mistake that is um on
01:05:48.319 cannabis as a quote-unquote gateway drug
01:05:52.319 it absolutely is in this sense that the
01:05:54.640 legalization of cannabis is going to
01:05:56.720 open the doors to as you say to the
01:05:58.960 legalization of psychedelics because
01:06:00.960 what's happening is that the population
01:06:02.799 is completely waking up to the fact that
01:06:05.440 they have been bullshitted and lied to
01:06:08.400 about cannabis for the best part of a
01:06:10.559 century and once that dawns on people
01:06:14.400 the realization at a direct personal
01:06:16.400 level here's this herb i love i have
01:06:18.640 been lied to
01:06:20.640 systematically misinformed by central
01:06:23.359 government about this about this herb
01:06:26.160 that leads to questioning of everything
01:06:28.160 that central government does and so in
01:06:29.839 that sense it is a gateway to a
01:06:31.440 questioning society the psychedelics are
01:06:34.240 different in that in that psilocybin um
01:06:38.319 actually does lead you to question stuff
01:06:40.720 it leads you to really ask questions
01:06:43.359 about about everything about your role
01:06:45.440 in the world about you as a person about
01:06:47.200 how you relate to other people and about
01:06:49.200 the whole system on this planet and that
01:06:50.799 the beautiful
01:06:52.160 gorgeous planet that we that we have and
01:06:54.160 what we're doing to it that that also
01:06:56.000 enters and enters awareness so it erodes
01:06:58.559 confidence and authority and it also
01:07:00.319 erodes confidence and authority that
01:07:01.839 doesn't have experiences that you've
01:07:03.280 experienced exactly that's the part of
01:07:04.880 the problem is that these people that
01:07:06.079 are holding people back from these
01:07:07.839 psychedelic experiences they've never
01:07:09.760 had them they've never had they don't
01:07:11.119 even know what they're rallying they're
01:07:13.039 coming to it from a place of fear and
01:07:14.559 prejudice uh they're simply accepting
01:07:17.200 stuff that they've been told without
01:07:18.640 really thinking it through and and and
01:07:20.559 examining it then again it's a failure
01:07:22.640 of of what human beings should should be
01:07:25.200 doing we have to get we have to get rid
01:07:26.720 of this fear and ironically it's bad for
01:07:28.799 them as well it's bad for the people
01:07:30.640 that are actually encouraging this these
01:07:32.960 laws to be enforced yes it's bad for the
01:07:35.599 it's bad for the whole of the whole of
01:07:37.039 society because it is healthy for a for
01:07:40.160 a society where adults become
01:07:42.400 self-realized individuals where they
01:07:44.799 make their own responsible choices about
01:07:47.039 their own lives where they don't say oh
01:07:49.280 government must make this choice for me
01:07:51.839 that's the next step for humanity we
01:07:53.839 start we need to start becoming our own
01:07:55.680 leaders and making our own choices and
01:07:59.359 that is that is what's being revealed
01:08:01.440 now that we're getting to the skull
01:08:03.200 beneath the smile of the war on drugs
01:08:05.440 we're realizing that it's part of a big
01:08:07.440 program of lying that has been about
01:08:10.319 keeping people's minds closed down not
01:08:12.799 wanting free thinking i've made this
01:08:14.480 point several times but our society is
01:08:16.479 not against altered states of
01:08:17.759 consciousness as such
01:08:19.679 our society will allow big pharma to
01:08:22.080 make billions of dollars with drugs that
01:08:23.920 alter consciousness like cerosat and
01:08:25.759 prozac antidepressants which in my
01:08:27.839 opinion having had some experience of
01:08:29.600 them are amongst the most horrible drugs
01:08:32.000 on the planet they are very harmful very
01:08:34.640 dangerous drugs but they're completely
01:08:36.080 legal and they're encouraged with our
01:08:37.679 system likewise alcohol very dangerous
01:08:40.158 drug
01:08:40.960 causes fights causes drunk driving
01:08:43.120 accidents leads to cirrhosis of the
01:08:44.719 liver completely legal and open our
01:08:46.960 society is not against altered states of
01:08:48.880 consciousness as such it's against
01:08:50.479 particular kinds of altered states of
01:08:52.158 consciousness that lead to questioning
01:08:54.158 of the existing control system that's
01:08:57.359 what's that's what's going on here here
01:08:59.679 here well said and as you know i have my
01:09:02.560 own story with uh with with cannabis
01:09:05.040 yeah and well you and i had a moment we
01:09:07.279 had a moment which was which was a quite
01:09:09.520 a life-changing moment for me because i
01:09:11.198 if i may just rehearse a little bit of
01:09:12.719 this for
01:09:13.600 for the audience um in 2011 i had a
01:09:17.759 series of ayahuasca sessions in which it
01:09:20.719 was shown to me that i was using
01:09:22.799 cannabis completely wrong
01:09:24.799 that it had become a dominant force in
01:09:27.279 my life that it was making me you're
01:09:29.198 speaking about paranoia and i agree with
01:09:30.799 you paranoia is a is a useful thing if
01:09:32.960 only to overcome it that it was making
01:09:34.399 me paranoid that it was making me
01:09:35.759 suspicious that i approached everybody
01:09:37.439 around me in a state of suspicion and i
01:09:40.000 was shown this by ayahuasca and given a
01:09:43.040 very strong message you need to quit
01:09:45.120 cannabis
01:09:46.640 what i didn't realize at the time is
01:09:48.719 that the problem was not cannabis the
01:09:51.120 problem was me
01:09:53.120 that i needed to fix those aspects of
01:09:55.280 myself before i could have a proper
01:09:57.199 relationship with cannabis so after that
01:09:58.960 i asked a session having smoked cannabis
01:10:01.440 for decades
01:10:03.280 literally 16 hours a day seven days a
01:10:05.600 week i quit i quit for three years
01:10:08.320 and then i'm on your show and we're
01:10:10.800 sitting we're sitting opposite one
01:10:12.159 another as we are now and you asked me a
01:10:13.920 question um are you still off the
01:10:15.840 cannabis and i say well i'm thinking of
01:10:18.239 dipping my toes back in the water at
01:10:19.520 which point you produce a joint
01:10:22.239 and and we smoke it together
01:10:24.560 first of all
01:10:26.239 after three years your tolerance is way
01:10:28.480 down on cannabis so i got really stoned
01:10:31.120 i did listen to that interview back and
01:10:32.640 somehow i held it together oh you held
01:10:34.480 it together brilliantly you opened up
01:10:36.400 and it was like a wave of information
01:10:38.480 came pouring out of you yeah it was
01:10:40.239 wonderful it was a liberation for me and
01:10:42.080 what it said to me is
01:10:43.600 it's time to go back to cannabis uh but
01:10:46.159 perhaps in a different way it doesn't it
01:10:48.239 i need a different relationship with
01:10:49.679 this amazing medicine and and if i can
01:10:52.159 forge that if i can make that different
01:10:53.760 relationship happen then it can be a
01:10:55.840 constructive and positive part of my
01:10:57.440 life and i can say definitely that that
01:10:59.440 has been the case that's excellent and
01:11:01.280 so it's all thanks to you joe i probably
01:11:02.800 would still be off cannabis if it hadn't
01:11:04.159 been for that joint well i think people
01:11:06.320 can develop these patterns of behavior
01:11:08.400 that are destructive with anything
01:11:09.920 whether it's with alcohol or cannabis or
01:11:11.920 you know yes sex or anything people get
01:11:14.719 they get in ruts and you know it doesn't
01:11:17.040 mean that the cannabis is bad this means
01:11:18.960 that you are on a bad mental path yes
01:11:21.120 you know exactly and i mean i'm not
01:11:23.120 encouraging it for everybody because
01:11:24.480 some people genuinely biologically
01:11:26.560 doesn't jive with them yeah yeah yeah
01:11:29.040 the fundamental thing is we as adult
01:11:31.120 human beings need to take responsibility
01:11:32.960 for our own lives and our own decisions
01:11:35.440 yeah and we need not hand that
01:11:37.040 responsibility over to governmental
01:11:39.120 institutions especially when it concerns
01:11:41.040 something as intimate and
01:11:42.960 personal as our consciousness and my
01:11:46.080 view is the ancient world had the right
01:11:48.800 attitude to this kind of thing and the
01:11:50.640 modern world
01:11:51.840 does not and that we can sit down and
01:11:54.239 learn a lot from the ancient world a lot
01:11:56.640 of people ask me
01:11:58.560 you know hancock you've been arguing
01:12:00.320 that there's a loss there's been a lost
01:12:01.760 civilization in the in the human story
01:12:04.159 but
01:12:04.880 what what sort of civilization do you
01:12:07.120 think it was well one of the things i
01:12:08.719 think is it was a civilization that used
01:12:10.480 psychedelics i think it was a
01:12:11.760 civilization that emerged from shamanism
01:12:14.480 but did not stay at the hunter-gatherer
01:12:16.239 stage but that took the essence of
01:12:17.760 shamanism and integrated it into a very
01:12:20.080 different kind of civilization from our
01:12:21.920 own which pursued things in different
01:12:23.920 ways a lot of archaeologists have said
01:12:25.679 to me but we don't find any plastic
01:12:27.679 bottles from the ice age that means
01:12:30.080 there was no advanced civilization
01:12:31.840 during the ice age well hang on maybe an
01:12:34.080 advanced civilization might have decided
01:12:35.840 never to get involved in plastic in the
01:12:37.440 first place maybe there would have been
01:12:39.040 a clear choice not to make plastic maybe
01:12:41.280 they did things in completely different
01:12:43.040 ways
01:12:44.080 maybe
01:12:45.520 they
01:12:46.320 cultivated powers of the human mind that
01:12:49.280 we dismiss and regard as uh completely
01:12:52.480 completely unimportant you know
01:12:55.199 yeah this is the thoughts about egypt
01:12:56.640 correct it's about about egypt and and
01:12:59.199 and about other things i mean the
01:13:01.040 specific example i give
01:13:03.520 is above the king's chamber in the great
01:13:06.880 pyramid are five further chambers
01:13:10.320 and these chambers are roofed and
01:13:12.560 floored with granite beams that weigh
01:13:15.679 about 70 tons each and there are
01:13:18.320 hundreds of them and these 70 ton
01:13:20.800 granite beams which to put in context a
01:13:22.800 70 ton beam is equivalent in weight to
01:13:24.719 35 large suvs these 70 ton granite beams
01:13:29.199 have been elevated to a height of more
01:13:30.719 than 350 feet above the ground and
01:13:32.800 carefully and precisely
01:13:34.800 placed in position
01:13:36.880 it is
01:13:37.920 very hard for archaeologists to explain
01:13:40.400 how that was done using purely leverage
01:13:43.199 and mechanical advantage you can say oh
01:13:45.679 perhaps they built a ramp and and and
01:13:48.080 hold the stones up the ramp then you
01:13:50.480 have to confront basic laws of physics
01:13:52.400 you can't haul a stone
01:13:55.199 weighing tens of tons up a slope that
01:13:57.760 exceeds 10 degrees then you start doing
01:14:00.400 the calculation how long a ramp do i
01:14:02.800 need with a 10 degree slope to get to
01:14:05.360 350 feet above the ground and the answer
01:14:08.080 is you need a [ __ ] long ramp
01:14:10.320 which which should still be there
01:14:12.640 because not it couldn't have been a sand
01:14:14.320 ramp it would have collapsed under the
01:14:15.679 weight of those stones it had to be as
01:14:16.880 massive as the pyramid itself so this
01:14:19.600 begins to seem like an absurd idea the
01:14:22.159 the idea that is foisted on us by
01:14:23.840 archaeology maybe the idea that they
01:14:26.320 regard as absurd namely that psychic
01:14:28.880 powers were cultivated by ancient
01:14:30.880 civilizations that they could use powers
01:14:32.800 of the human mind that we have allowed
01:14:34.400 to lapse maybe that idea deserves
01:14:36.960 further consideration
01:14:38.960 we have gone down a path of leverage and
01:14:41.199 mechanical advantage we're used to
01:14:42.960 relying on machines but we hear
01:14:45.360 anecdotal reports of people who have
01:14:47.360 telekinetic powers who can move things
01:14:49.600 with their minds of people who have
01:14:51.120 telepathic powers and our automatic
01:14:52.960 reaction is to just dismiss all of that
01:14:55.840 because science says it's impossible um
01:14:58.480 be
01:14:59.120 because uh science regards consciousness
01:15:01.760 as as local to the brain and doesn't see
01:15:03.920 how it can exert itself
01:15:05.840 outside of that but maybe we should open
01:15:07.600 up to those possibilities that we're
01:15:08.960 dealing with a very different kind of
01:15:10.320 culture that used techniques that we
01:15:12.719 have allowed to lapse and maybe we could
01:15:14.239 wake those techniques up again maybe the
01:15:16.400 ability of human beings to do almost
01:15:19.199 superhuman things is resident
01:15:22.480 within all of us but sleeping well it's
01:15:24.880 pure speculation that they use some sort
01:15:26.719 of a telekinetic power but it's pure
01:15:28.719 speculation but it's absolute that they
01:15:30.560 did something that we don't understand
01:15:32.640 if you think about the distance between
01:15:34.880 us and the construction just the modern
01:15:37.199 accepted construction dates of the great
01:15:39.040 pyramid it's more than five thousand
01:15:40.960 years ago or close to five thousand
01:15:42.400 years ago great pyramid is supposed to
01:15:43.600 be about four thousand five hundred
01:15:44.640 years old yeah that's really old it's
01:15:46.800 incredible
01:15:47.840 to think that someone back then could do
01:15:50.080 something that would perplex us today
01:15:52.320 with modern machinery yeah and that
01:15:54.320 somehow or another they figured this out
01:15:56.239 it's almost like
01:15:57.760 what they had done was leave behind
01:16:00.080 something that was so stupendous
01:16:03.280 so
01:16:04.320 monstrously impressive that it would
01:16:07.199 transcend time yeah and that you would
01:16:09.679 have to look at it even thousands and
01:16:11.360 thousands of years later and say hey
01:16:13.600 like this this defies
01:16:16.320 conventional explanation this is not a
01:16:18.320 simple and i've seen some of the
01:16:19.520 conventional explanations of the
01:16:21.360 construction of the pyramid and they
01:16:23.280 conveniently neglect those chambers
01:16:25.199 above the king's chamber they do they
01:16:26.880 conveniently neglect a lot of those
01:16:28.480 massive stones
01:16:29.840 and it's because it's it's one of those
01:16:31.840 things you just go oh i don't know what
01:16:34.000 is this jamie they're the they're the
01:16:36.000 chambers
01:16:36.960 above the above the king's chambers and
01:16:38.640 each one of those floors is is consists
01:16:40.880 of a row of 70-ton granite blocks
01:16:44.560 that have been raised 350 feet above the
01:16:46.560 ground and not only that but brought
01:16:47.920 from aswan in the south of egypt 500
01:16:50.320 kilometers south of the south of the
01:16:51.920 great pyramid so if there's any time in
01:16:53.440 history where you could go
01:16:55.440 in a time machine and go back and
01:16:57.520 observe would that be the time
01:17:00.159 i am just completely fascinated by the
01:17:02.960 ice age
01:17:04.480 at the moment if you had one shot to go
01:17:06.800 back and see what it was like in some
01:17:08.800 place
01:17:09.840 you wouldn't go to the construction of
01:17:11.120 the great pyramids
01:17:12.560 i think right now where i'd go is 12
01:17:15.280 hundred years ago in the beginning of
01:17:16.480 the younger dry ass ah just to see
01:17:18.239 because i think that's where the whole
01:17:19.760 human story changes i think that's where
01:17:21.760 we change tracks from one path to
01:17:24.320 another path and following those
01:17:26.480 cataclysmic events of the younger dryers
01:17:28.640 between 12 800 and 11 600 years ago
01:17:31.679 following those the signs of
01:17:33.360 civilization that we see emerging are
01:17:35.440 not the beginnings of civilization
01:17:37.280 they're a restarting of civilization
01:17:39.760 that had existed before the cataclysm
01:17:42.320 and for that reason um i would uh i
01:17:45.440 would like to be present
01:17:47.440 during that cataclysmic event if only to
01:17:49.360 satisfy myself that it was indeed a
01:17:51.199 comet you see the the one thing there's
01:17:53.040 no dispute about anymore
01:17:55.120 is that the younger dryas was a
01:17:57.040 cataclysm you can't they can't argue
01:17:59.199 about that the the the megafauna that
01:18:01.840 that that die off the disruption of
01:18:03.520 human activity that takes place at that
01:18:05.199 time the huge climate changes this was a
01:18:07.440 cataclysm by any standards where the
01:18:09.040 argument still goes on is what caused
01:18:11.199 the what caused the cataclysm i vote
01:18:13.520 strongly for comet multiple fragments of
01:18:16.719 a comet hitting the north american ice
01:18:18.400 cap and hitting greenland as well but
01:18:21.360 there are other researchers in the field
01:18:22.960 like my colleague robert shock who
01:18:24.640 thinks that the sun is more involved
01:18:26.800 this is healthy this is very very
01:18:28.400 healthy that there should we should be
01:18:30.000 approaching this problem from many
01:18:31.440 different perspectives and trying to
01:18:33.440 figure out what the [ __ ] caused this
01:18:35.360 extraordinary event that occurs at a
01:18:38.320 pivotal moment in the human story
01:18:40.480 the end of the stone age the beginning
01:18:42.239 of the mesolithic the end of the ice age
01:18:44.320 the beginning of the current age of the
01:18:45.760 earth and suddenly we see these signs of
01:18:48.080 civilization appearing and in places
01:18:49.679 like gobekli tepe those signs already
01:18:51.760 include highly sophisticated knowledge
01:18:54.480 and that's why i feel
01:18:56.480 we really need to investigate the amazon
01:18:59.679 there are there are three places in the
01:19:01.520 world which are really lacking in the
01:19:03.440 investigation right now
01:19:05.120 one of them is the amazon five and a
01:19:07.360 half million square kilometers very
01:19:09.280 little archaeology done another is the
01:19:11.120 sahara desert the sahara desert
01:19:13.920 tough place to work i can understand why
01:19:15.600 there's little archaeology done there
01:19:17.199 but the sahara desert was green during
01:19:18.960 the ice age it had a completely
01:19:20.320 different climate regime we should
01:19:21.679 consider the possibility that missing
01:19:23.040 parts of the human story are there and
01:19:24.560 then under the continental shelves
01:19:26.320 because sea level rose 400 feet these
01:19:28.480 are three domains that archaeology has
01:19:32.000 largely not investigated and and it has
01:19:34.560 largely not done so they say well why
01:19:36.080 would we spend the money on marine
01:19:37.520 archaeology it's much better to spend it
01:19:39.440 on looking for shipwrecks rather than
01:19:41.280 looking for signs of a lost civilization
01:19:42.880 because we archaeologists know there was
01:19:44.480 no lost civilization so that's the
01:19:46.800 argument for the resources there and and
01:19:48.960 the same the same with the amazon and
01:19:50.640 the same with the with with the sahara
01:19:52.320 desert places in the very places in the
01:19:54.159 world
01:19:55.040 that those amongst us who are charged
01:19:58.000 with the responsibility of interpreting
01:19:59.760 the past have not looked at
01:20:02.080 are the very prices we should be looking
01:20:04.320 at i had a thought once while i was
01:20:07.120 under the influence
01:20:09.360 and it was um a thought that one day
01:20:12.480 computational powers will reach a point
01:20:15.920 where they will be able to take into
01:20:17.520 consideration all of the objects on
01:20:20.080 earth
01:20:21.120 and what we know about the history and
01:20:24.320 vividly recreate the past through
01:20:27.040 computation to the point where you could
01:20:28.719 actually know who did what when people
01:20:31.679 did things and that i mean i don't even
01:20:34.239 know if this would be physical
01:20:36.159 today certainly not be possible but with
01:20:39.840 the exponential increase in
01:20:42.080 computational power and technology and
01:20:44.640 innovation that one day will reach a
01:20:46.640 point where you'll be able to watch
01:20:49.040 you'll be able to see what happened and
01:20:51.280 they'll be able to recreate what
01:20:52.640 happened exactly and that this would be
01:20:55.199 something that would be
01:20:56.960 it's
01:20:58.400 impossible for us to imagine that
01:21:00.080 someone would be able to do that right
01:21:01.760 now yeah but that one day with
01:21:04.159 technology as it gets more and more
01:21:07.040 advanced we will reach some sort of a
01:21:09.840 some innovation or some sort of an
01:21:11.760 invention that will allow us to go back
01:21:15.040 and see literally see what what happened
01:21:18.320 how things were done
01:21:19.920 technology is is changing our whole
01:21:22.400 understanding of the past and what
01:21:23.760 you're envisaging is perfectly possible
01:21:26.320 we will we will come to a time if 100
01:21:29.040 years 500 perhaps less if if we don't
01:21:31.920 you know first destroy ourselves
01:21:33.600 entirely as a civilization we will come
01:21:35.520 to a time where our cleverness and our
01:21:37.679 techniques will allow a much wider
01:21:40.080 opening up of the past than has
01:21:41.600 presently happened but it is already
01:21:43.600 happening
01:21:44.960 one of the areas of science that i go
01:21:47.280 into in america before is genetics
01:21:51.120 and and dna
01:21:52.960 this is an area of science that
01:21:55.120 was not much informing archaeology until
01:21:58.880 about the 1990s but since the 2000s has
01:22:02.480 become very important in archaeology
01:22:04.400 because the technology has been
01:22:05.600 developed where ancient dna can be
01:22:08.960 extracted and tested and you can
01:22:10.560 actually genotype an entire individual
01:22:12.480 from dna that may be 15 20 000 20 000
01:22:15.520 years old
01:22:17.040 and this
01:22:18.400 new technology of genome sequencing and
01:22:21.600 and dna is another factor that is
01:22:24.639 raising huge question marks over the
01:22:26.880 past of the americas and one of the
01:22:29.760 issues i go into
01:22:32.080 in this book
01:22:33.280 is the presence in the amazon rainforest
01:22:36.880 of a very specific clearly identifiable
01:22:40.480 pattern of dna which is only found in
01:22:43.199 one other place in the world and that is
01:22:45.360 in australasia
01:22:47.120 in papua new guinea and amongst
01:22:49.280 australian aborigines it's australasian
01:22:52.080 dna uh now south america in not only in
01:22:55.360 south america but in the depths of the
01:22:57.840 amazon rainforest amongst tribes who've
01:23:00.080 only been contacted in the last 20 or 30
01:23:02.320 years
01:23:03.440 and furthermore although skeletal
01:23:05.360 remains are rare it has been found in
01:23:08.639 ancient skeletal remains that are close
01:23:10.639 to 11 000 years old in the amazon so
01:23:12.719 that tells us that this dna signal has
01:23:14.960 been in the amazon for at least 11 000
01:23:17.280 years the geneticists think that it came
01:23:19.520 to the amazon during the last ice age
01:23:22.080 and this raises a huge mystery because
01:23:24.480 the peopling of the americas is supposed
01:23:26.400 to have occurred from siberia across the
01:23:29.920 bering straits down through that
01:23:32.000 ice-free corridor into north america
01:23:34.159 down through north america into south
01:23:35.679 america into central america and finally
01:23:37.760 into south america if that was the whole
01:23:40.239 story then we would find this dna signal
01:23:43.679 in north america and in central america
01:23:46.320 we would not find it only
01:23:48.400 in the amazon
01:23:49.840 and i talked to some of the leading
01:23:51.280 geneticists about this but specifically
01:23:54.000 um
01:23:54.800 professor sk willis lev at the
01:23:56.159 university of copenhagen who's been
01:23:58.560 the lead author in a number of
01:24:00.400 major studies of ancient dna and i asked
01:24:02.880 him what do you make of this
01:24:04.320 australasian dna uh in in the amazon and
01:24:07.120 and he said honestly
01:24:08.960 we don't have a proper explanation for
01:24:11.120 it at the moment but what he did say is
01:24:13.440 that the most parsimonious explanation
01:24:16.159 he used that specific word the most
01:24:18.000 parsimonious explanation is that a group
01:24:20.560 of people during the ice age crossed the
01:24:23.760 pacific ocean
01:24:25.520 and settled up and ended up in south
01:24:27.360 america and settled in the amazon and
01:24:29.280 brought their dna with them that would
01:24:31.120 account perfectly for the dna data and
01:24:34.080 when a scientist says the most
01:24:35.360 parsimonious explanation what that
01:24:37.440 scientist is saying is he likes that
01:24:38.800 explanation but it's a simple direct
01:24:41.040 clear explanation of the dna mystery but
01:24:43.679 then he added however it doesn't make
01:24:45.760 practical sense and i asked him why
01:24:47.760 doesn't it make practical sense and he
01:24:49.120 said because the archaeologists tell me
01:24:52.080 that no human population was capable of
01:24:54.800 crossing the pacific ocean during the
01:24:56.719 ice age at which point it was natural
01:24:58.639 for me to say do you really trust the
01:25:00.960 archaeologists and he said well in
01:25:02.880 science we do trust the work of other
01:25:04.719 scientists we don't really question it
01:25:06.159 we don't really investigate it that's
01:25:07.679 their side of the their side of the
01:25:09.199 business um and and my my view is that
01:25:12.000 that is rather than
01:25:15.679 rather than except rather than taking
01:25:17.520 this weird anomalous australasian dna
01:25:20.400 signal uh in the in in the in the heart
01:25:23.040 of the amazon uh as something to be
01:25:25.840 explained away and as something to be
01:25:29.600 for it to be denied that it could be
01:25:31.840 connected to a voyage across the pacific
01:25:33.840 ocean maybe it's the first compelling
01:25:35.840 evidence that voyages were taking place
01:25:38.000 across the pacific ocean during the ice
01:25:40.320 age and maybe we should be opening up
01:25:42.639 that whole issue for exploration and
01:25:44.320 again i think a lost a lost civilization
01:25:46.719 is the best answer and that near the end
01:25:48.880 of the ice age
01:25:50.239 when when the younger dryas cataclysm
01:25:53.199 unfolds it's not an overnight thing it's
01:25:55.679 very bad twelve thousand eight hundred
01:25:57.360 years ago there's about one thousand two
01:25:59.440 hundred years of horror i don't think
01:26:00.960 the civilization went down in a single
01:26:03.120 day at night i think there were
01:26:04.719 survivors i think bits of it were left i
01:26:07.199 think their project was to restart
01:26:09.280 civilization and i suggest very strongly
01:26:12.560 that where they tried to mount that
01:26:14.320 project was amongst the hunter-gatherers
01:26:16.639 who coexisted in the world with them at
01:26:19.600 that time
01:26:20.800 we ourselves are an advanced
01:26:22.560 civilization at least that's what we
01:26:24.639 call ourselves and we coexist in the
01:26:27.040 world with hunter-gatherers uh it's not
01:26:29.280 an odd idea that an advanced
01:26:30.800 civilization and together should coexist
01:26:32.960 and there is separation between us and
01:26:34.800 the amazonian hunt together as there are
01:26:36.400 tribes in the amazon that are
01:26:38.000 uncontacted and that we that we don't
01:26:40.239 know even exist
01:26:42.719 if
01:26:43.679 a catastrophe on the level of the
01:26:46.000 younger dryas were to occur today
01:26:49.520 i don't think that our civilization
01:26:51.600 would make it through we are the spoiled
01:26:53.760 children
01:26:54.800 of the earth we are just used to having
01:26:57.679 everything laid on you know the
01:26:59.840 supermarket shelves are groaning with
01:27:03.040 with food we can get food delivered to
01:27:05.679 our homes we have roofs over our head we
01:27:07.440 have shelters we have clothing
01:27:08.800 everything is taken for granted
01:27:10.800 i guess you're an exception but very few
01:27:12.880 people in modern western culture know
01:27:15.280 how to survive they don't have survival
01:27:16.960 skills they don't know how to hunt they
01:27:18.800 don't know how to gather they don't know
01:27:20.480 how to grow crops because they've handed
01:27:22.880 that responsibility over to others we
01:27:24.560 live in a society that's highly
01:27:25.920 segmented and specialized and different
01:27:27.600 people specialize in different things
01:27:29.040 but nobody has the vast general survival
01:27:32.159 skill that a hunter-gatherer has so in a
01:27:34.480 global cataclysm actually at first
01:27:37.000 counter-intuitively the people who would
01:27:39.040 survive it would be the hunter-gatherers
01:27:41.040 and an advanced civilization would be
01:27:42.880 smart if they were survivors to seek
01:27:45.040 refuge amongst hunter gatherers
01:27:47.760 to to make that the place where they
01:27:49.360 might try to start restart their
01:27:50.880 civilization and that's why i think that
01:27:53.199 this australasian dna signal in the
01:27:56.000 amazon may be part of the evidence for a
01:27:58.400 sort of outreach effort that was being
01:28:00.480 made by a lost civilization seeing the
01:28:02.480 disaster coming down on it and realizing
01:28:04.480 that something needed to be done well
01:28:06.480 it's fascinating to me that the
01:28:08.239 geneticists would rely on the
01:28:09.679 archaeologist being that the geneticists
01:28:11.840 have the actual dna they can examine
01:28:14.080 where the archaeologists are piecing
01:28:15.679 things together yeah little tiny bits of
01:28:18.000 information
01:28:19.280 over the entire
01:28:21.040 landscape and then you consider how much
01:28:23.360 information they don't have access to
01:28:25.040 that's in the ground exactly
01:28:27.440 so much i strongly resist the idea that
01:28:29.440 archaeology is a science i i don't think
01:28:31.600 it should be described as a science what
01:28:33.360 do you think it should be described it's
01:28:34.639 more like a kind of philosophy it's a
01:28:36.480 it's it's a it's an attempt to
01:28:38.800 interpret the past uh based on rather
01:28:42.800 flimsy and limited evidence and what you
01:28:44.880 find in that interpretation is that the
01:28:46.560 preconceptions of the individuals
01:28:48.239 involved are being imposed upon the
01:28:50.159 evidence which then turns out to support
01:28:52.480 their preconceptions and that's not a
01:28:54.400 scientific way of doing things a
01:28:55.760 scientific way of doing things is
01:28:56.960 testing testing hypotheses and false
01:28:59.199 seeking to falsify them and seeing if
01:29:00.719 they if they if they work out so the
01:29:03.040 problem is drawing these conclusions and
01:29:04.880 then being too rigid with these
01:29:06.159 conclusions
01:29:07.679 further evidence that's that's my view
01:29:09.679 yeah that that um archaeology has been
01:29:12.960 has been much too rigid and and that
01:29:14.960 there's a
01:29:16.000 there's a climate of fear in archaeology
01:29:18.560 i don't mean to pick particularly on
01:29:20.159 archaeologists here i think this is
01:29:21.679 generally true
01:29:23.280 across other disciplines as well
01:29:27.440 these days academics are driven by the
01:29:29.199 need to publish research papers that's
01:29:31.120 what they build their careers on if they
01:29:32.800 can get a paper on their bit of research
01:29:35.199 published in nature or the proceedings
01:29:36.800 of the national academy of sciences etc
01:29:38.880 that's good for their careers but then
01:29:41.520 you confront the gatekeepers in those
01:29:43.520 publications who regard any
01:29:46.159 archaeological idea that is not part of
01:29:48.320 the mainstream accepted consensus with
01:29:50.239 great suspicion and are most
01:29:52.400 most reluctant uh to to you know to
01:29:55.679 publish to publish that information
01:29:58.159 now what is the mainstream uh
01:30:01.199 when archaeologists talk about seafaring
01:30:03.760 humans when what what do they date that
01:30:06.159 too well there's the great asians yes
01:30:08.719 the great seafaring adventure that is
01:30:10.639 accepted by archaeology is called the
01:30:12.719 polynesian expansion and it's a
01:30:14.480 remarkable story and that occurs roughly
01:30:16.960 three thousand to three thousand five
01:30:19.040 hundred years ago and those polynesians
01:30:21.600 were amazing ocean navigators they could
01:30:24.159 they could cross distances of thousands
01:30:26.480 of kilometers with pinpoint accuracy i
01:30:29.120 mean it's not an accident that the
01:30:30.880 polynesians found easter island finding
01:30:33.679 easter island is a really challenging
01:30:35.600 project easter island is two thousand
01:30:37.920 miles from the coast of south america
01:30:39.760 it's two thousand miles from the nearest
01:30:41.520 other island which is tahiti it's just a
01:30:43.840 little speck in the middle of the ocean
01:30:45.920 but the polynesians found it and settled
01:30:48.480 there and appeared to have brought a
01:30:49.920 reproductively viable population there
01:30:52.159 and appear to have made voyages back and
01:30:54.400 forth but
01:30:55.600 that was three thousand to three
01:30:56.880 thousand five hundred years ago that was
01:30:58.480 not twelve thousand eight hundred years
01:31:00.480 ago
01:31:01.360 and this is this is where
01:31:03.199 archaeology's adamant position that
01:31:05.760 ocean voyaging
01:31:07.199 was begun by the polynesians and that
01:31:09.360 there was no major ocean voyages before
01:31:11.280 that i think needs to be strongly
01:31:12.960 questioned and it needs to be strongly
01:31:14.320 questioned in the light of this dna
01:31:15.920 evidence from the amazon rather than
01:31:17.679 rejecting the evidence an attempt should
01:31:19.679 be made to consider what that might mean
01:31:21.760 well it's interesting because we know
01:31:23.120 that the egyptians had boats yeah and so
01:31:26.560 what i mean if there were boats 4 500
01:31:29.120 years ago why do we think that they
01:31:30.480 didn't try them out in the ocean that
01:31:31.679 doesn't make any sense especially if
01:31:32.960 they existed a thousand years prior
01:31:34.960 which is also possible
01:31:36.719 archaeologists wouldn't argue that the
01:31:38.400 egyptians had boats but but that is that
01:31:40.639 is still within the the framework of
01:31:42.719 accepted history it's it's the notion of
01:31:44.880 a of a global navigating culture
01:31:47.920 in the ice age that archaeologists can't
01:31:50.800 swallow it's a subject that i've kept on
01:31:53.280 coming up against over a number of years
01:31:55.360 i think the best evidence for it is
01:31:57.600 ancient maps uh which show the world as
01:32:00.560 it looked during the last ice age i
01:32:02.880 first explored this in fingerprints of
01:32:04.400 the gods and i've touched on the mystery
01:32:05.760 again and i have an appendix on the
01:32:07.440 subject in in in this book because i
01:32:09.440 think these are very important we're
01:32:11.120 talking about maps that were drawn
01:32:13.440 roughly between the 1300s and the 1700s
01:32:17.920 in other words in relatively recent
01:32:19.840 history however these maps were largely
01:32:23.520 based on much older source maps which
01:32:26.159 they copied and we can say that for sure
01:32:28.560 because one of the famous maps is the
01:32:30.320 piri reese map which was created by a
01:32:32.480 turkish admiral called pirie reese in
01:32:34.239 the year 1513.
01:32:36.400 actually only a corner of his map has
01:32:38.080 survived it was originally a world map
01:32:40.080 we now just have a bit that shows the
01:32:41.440 east coast of uh south america and north
01:32:44.000 america and the west coast of africa
01:32:46.560 pirrie reese writes in that map that it
01:32:49.199 is in his own handwriting that he based
01:32:51.360 it on more than 100 older source maps
01:32:54.400 some of which had come from the library
01:32:57.360 of alexandria in other words that maps
01:32:59.679 had been when the library of alexandria
01:33:01.520 had been destroyed in the fourth century
01:33:03.280 idea whenever it was some of its
01:33:05.280 contents had been rescued and brought to
01:33:07.280 constantinople which became the turkish
01:33:09.120 capital and pirie reese had access to
01:33:10.880 those maps and he incorporated
01:33:12.639 information from those maps on his maps
01:33:15.600 as well as incorporating more recent
01:33:17.920 navigational information and this is one
01:33:19.920 of a whole category of maps which are
01:33:22.080 extremely hard to explain all of them
01:33:24.400 based on older source maps now lost all
01:33:27.280 of them incorporating extremely precise
01:33:30.080 relative longitudes and latitudes
01:33:32.480 latitude is not that difficult a
01:33:34.239 technological feat but longitude is a
01:33:36.800 difficult technological feat longitude
01:33:39.440 involves a chronometer it involves
01:33:41.120 knowing the time at the place you began
01:33:42.800 your voyage and the local and local noon
01:33:44.880 as well and calculating the difference
01:33:46.639 between them you need a chronometer that
01:33:48.719 will keep accurate time at sea with the
01:33:51.679 motions of a ship and it's just a plain
01:33:53.280 fact that our civilization did not
01:33:55.600 invent such a chronometer until the late
01:33:58.080 18th century before that we didn't know
01:34:00.960 what longitude we were at and ships were
01:34:03.199 constantly sailing unexpectedly into
01:34:05.199 coastlines that they thought were
01:34:06.400 hundreds of miles
01:34:07.840 further away so the discovery of the
01:34:09.520 technique to do longitude was a major
01:34:11.679 civilizational advance its presence in
01:34:14.560 maps based on much older source maps
01:34:17.040 that actually show the world as it looks
01:34:18.960 during the last ice age suggests that
01:34:21.199 somebody during the last ice age was
01:34:22.880 mapping the world and had mastered the
01:34:25.040 technique of calculating
01:34:27.120 longitude
01:34:28.560 classic example of these maps
01:34:32.320 and i make a point of this is what's
01:34:34.400 called the pinkerton world map which was
01:34:37.199 drawn in the year 1818
01:34:40.239 and it was based on the latest
01:34:42.159 navigational information at that time i
01:34:44.800 reproduced that map in the in the book
01:34:47.120 what's missing from the map entirely
01:34:49.199 missing is antarctica there's just a
01:34:51.760 hole at the bottom of the world there's
01:34:54.000 nothing there and the reason the reason
01:34:56.400 there's nothing there
01:34:57.840 there's another there's another
01:34:59.120 pinkerton map that uh that shows that um
01:35:02.560 the
01:35:03.679 the reason that you'll need to find one
01:35:05.679 that's centered on antarctica
01:35:07.760 the reason the reason that antarctica is
01:35:10.080 not there is that our civilization
01:35:12.000 hadn't discovered antarctica in 1818 so
01:35:15.040 they couldn't authentically put it on a
01:35:16.639 map in 1818. actually we discovered it
01:35:19.840 in 1819 and that's when it starts
01:35:21.920 appearing on modern maps
01:35:24.560 the problem is that antarctica rep
01:35:26.880 appears repeatedly on these much older
01:35:29.440 maps and it appears in the right place
01:35:32.480 and a bit bigger than it is today but
01:35:34.560 very much as it looked during the last
01:35:36.239 ice age so what all of this suggests to
01:35:38.800 me is that the world was mapped and
01:35:40.639 explored by a global seafaring culture
01:35:42.960 with a level of technology that was at
01:35:44.880 least equivalent to ours at the end of
01:35:46.480 the 18th century uh during the ice age
01:35:49.199 wasn't there also a map of greenland
01:35:51.280 that showed it underneath the ice yes
01:35:53.440 there are and and and uh another
01:35:56.400 intriguing thing i mean i mentioned the
01:35:58.320 piri reese map just now
01:36:00.239 shown on the piri reese map lying off
01:36:02.800 the east coast of north america is a
01:36:05.040 large island with a row of megaliths
01:36:07.679 like a road of megaliths running up the
01:36:10.239 middle of it
01:36:11.520 um that island is in the exact place of
01:36:14.719 the grand bahama banks uh and and uh
01:36:18.639 is it
01:36:19.440 on this one yeah it is um but can i
01:36:22.159 point it out to you because you're not
01:36:23.360 sure it's um
01:36:26.000 it's there that's right there okay this
01:36:27.440 thing that one okay right here it's
01:36:29.920 great that you can bring this up jamie
01:36:31.120 that's amazing so this island is sitting
01:36:33.440 there off the southeast coast of north
01:36:35.440 america look at the way they used to
01:36:37.040 draw things back then too and and what
01:36:39.199 you see running down the middle of it is
01:36:41.040 this road-like feature of of
01:36:44.400 yes i see right there yeah
01:36:47.920 now the thing is
01:36:49.360 it was a long period of my life when i i
01:36:51.199 did a lot of scuba diving and i was
01:36:52.960 looking at underwater structures and one
01:36:54.719 of the sites i dived on was the bimini
01:36:56.960 road which is in the grand bahama banks
01:36:59.520 and the bimidi road is exactly where
01:37:01.520 that island is and the the here's the
01:37:03.760 issue
01:37:04.560 i don't care whether the bimini road is
01:37:06.480 natural or man-made for me the mystery
01:37:08.960 is that it is shown above water on that
01:37:11.440 map and the last time it was above water
01:37:13.440 was thousands and thousands of years ago
01:37:16.159 so for me this is all evidence that we
01:37:18.320 shouldn't dismiss the possibility that
01:37:20.159 our ancestors had achieved a level of
01:37:22.080 technology where they could explore and
01:37:23.760 map the world's oceans we shouldn't
01:37:25.119 dismiss that there it is right there so
01:37:26.960 we don't know what those stones are or
01:37:28.960 how they were created but boy do they
01:37:31.920 look
01:37:33.360 in japan we're looking at now but go
01:37:35.040 back to that image jimmy did the last
01:37:36.480 image that we were just looking at look
01:37:38.000 at that i mean that looks so man-made
01:37:40.320 and you can see that it's rather like
01:37:41.920 the the pattern that's shown on the on
01:37:44.000 the island in the in the map how deep is
01:37:45.920 that today oh it's not very deep it's
01:37:47.280 about 20 feet
01:37:48.719 but we think that that was above water
01:37:51.440 it was definitely above water during the
01:37:53.119 last ice age uh when it when it finally
01:37:55.360 went underwater may have been as late as
01:37:57.119 eight or nine thousand years is there
01:37:58.480 anything else compelling that's in the
01:37:59.920 immediate area that seems to indicate
01:38:01.760 that there was some sort of a man-made
01:38:03.040 structure well nobody's looked for it uh
01:38:05.280 and the whole effort of archaeology has
01:38:07.119 been to dismiss the significance of the
01:38:08.800 bimini robe why would they dismiss that
01:38:10.560 well they say it's just amazing they say
01:38:12.000 it's totally natural come on
01:38:14.560 is it let's go go back to that image
01:38:16.159 again
01:38:17.119 listen but but we'll this is the uh go
01:38:18.960 back to that image that we just saw yeah
01:38:20.960 are you sure as somebody who spent a lot
01:38:23.119 of time diving on the bimini road i can
01:38:25.040 tell you i absolutely do not think it's
01:38:27.040 natural i think it's a man-made
01:38:28.480 structure but the argument is that it's
01:38:30.000 a kind of beach rock that forms in these
01:38:32.080 blocky formations
01:38:33.760 yes beach rock does form in blocky
01:38:35.280 formation but here i believe that the
01:38:36.800 beach rock has been used as a
01:38:38.159 construction material
01:38:39.760 but i repeat
01:38:41.440 the key issue is not whether the bimini
01:38:44.000 road is man-made or not the key issue is
01:38:46.719 that it features on a map above water
01:38:49.679 and that is a dating project that tells
01:38:51.760 us that somebody was mapping that bit of
01:38:53.760 the world when it was above water
01:38:56.880 takes us back a very long a long way
01:38:58.719 into the past the one that you just
01:39:00.320 pulled up you know look at that one it's
01:39:02.000 a stunning place it's an amazing amazing
01:39:03.840 sight it's just like the odds of that
01:39:05.840 being in that order with those uniformly
01:39:08.639 sized rocks first how long is that oh
01:39:11.679 hundreds of feet it's a huge it's
01:39:13.520 actually shaped like the letter j it's a
01:39:15.440 it's a giant underwater structure it's
01:39:17.360 really really an enormous thing and very
01:39:19.040 very beautiful to dive on and there's
01:39:20.320 lots of very gentle sweet nurse sharks
01:39:22.159 down there that you can play with so
01:39:23.520 that looks much more like random that's
01:39:26.080 more random a bits of it bits of it do
01:39:27.679 look more random and bits of it look
01:39:29.600 highly constructed i would not um i
01:39:32.400 would not seek to
01:39:34.000 to claim that the bimini road is
01:39:36.239 absolutely man-made my claim about the
01:39:38.159 bimini road is it's really [ __ ] weird
01:39:40.080 that it appears on a map above water
01:39:42.080 yeah uh a map that was drawn in 1513
01:39:44.560 based on older source maps now when they
01:39:46.960 found that ancient greek uh computer
01:39:50.400 thing um what is that called antikythera
01:39:53.040 mechanism yes yeah again that testifies
01:39:55.760 to a lost navigational skill that yeah
01:39:59.119 that we have not taken account of
01:40:00.719 incredibly complex and it took a long
01:40:03.199 time for them to figure out what that
01:40:04.639 even is yeah what do they think that is
01:40:06.639 now um it tracks the movements of the
01:40:09.360 planets it's a it's a navigational
01:40:11.040 device it's uh it it's a geared cogged
01:40:14.719 system that allows you to track the
01:40:16.480 passage of time and figure out where you
01:40:18.320 are it's it's some kind of navigational
01:40:20.080 device it's not fully understood and how
01:40:21.600 old is that i think that goes back to
01:40:23.760 greek times i'm guessing here because
01:40:26.239 the greek times are not of great
01:40:27.840 interest to me but i'm thinking around
01:40:29.679 about 500 bc
01:40:31.280 so
01:40:32.239 at least 2 000 years old 2000 plus and
01:40:35.440 we know that there had to be more than
01:40:37.920 one of these things yes
01:40:40.159 you can't you can't have something like
01:40:41.600 that without without a vast effort
01:40:44.080 behind it
01:40:45.280 human beings were working on creating
01:40:47.119 this geared and cogged machinery uh that
01:40:50.000 that reflected the pattern oh is that a
01:40:51.760 recreation that's a recreation
01:40:54.880 yeah do you can you buy one of those
01:40:58.000 it looks like you buy that dude fine
01:41:01.119 bookmark that we need one right there
01:41:03.360 right next to the plastic cells so such
01:41:05.440 a thing is a is a cultural artifact
01:41:07.360 which doesn't just appear out of nowhere
01:41:09.360 it hasn't it has to have a context it
01:41:10.960 has to have a background and again
01:41:13.440 my suggestion would be
01:41:16.480 perhaps a secret technology it's very
01:41:18.560 odd that very few of these have been
01:41:20.880 found and it may be that ship owners and
01:41:23.040 navigators in greek times were extremely
01:41:25.760 careful about who they shared this
01:41:27.760 technology with of course
01:41:29.920 they may it may have been as top secret
01:41:31.760 as you know nuclear power is in in our
01:41:34.560 world today and that makes sense but
01:41:37.360 the fact is that then we have to we it
01:41:39.600 exists it's real it's there yeah and
01:41:42.400 then we must consider
01:41:44.080 what's behind it what what led to that
01:41:46.719 is that just the latest manifestation of
01:41:48.719 something that that goes much more
01:41:50.719 deeply back into human human culture and
01:41:53.119 i i think that is i think i suppose my
01:41:55.360 main my main message is that we have
01:41:58.159 a so far untold backstory that we're
01:42:00.719 concentrating entirely on the front
01:42:02.320 story and the back story is missing very
01:42:05.440 largely missing from the picture and
01:42:06.800 what i've tried to do is to fill in bits
01:42:08.560 of the backstory do you have anything in
01:42:10.560 this book about the olmecs
01:42:12.639 no not really um i i mentioned i
01:42:14.880 mentioned them briefly uh i explored the
01:42:17.760 olmec mystery uh in considerable depth
01:42:20.880 can you explain that to people maybe in
01:42:22.880 the fingerprints of the gods uh yes so
01:42:25.679 it's considered to be the earliest high
01:42:27.520 culture of central america everybody's
01:42:30.159 heard about the aztecs everybody's heard
01:42:32.800 about the maya
01:42:34.320 but before the aztecs and before the
01:42:36.639 maya
01:42:37.600 there were a culture who are referred to
01:42:40.320 as the olmecs again we don't know what
01:42:43.920 they called themselves that's what the
01:42:45.520 aztecs called them they called them the
01:42:46.800 olmecs and it means the rubber people
01:42:48.239 because they that rubber producing area
01:42:50.960 of of mexico
01:42:52.960 they worked in
01:42:54.880 giant megalithic constructions that what
01:42:57.600 they're most famous for
01:42:59.440 is these huge carved human heads which
01:43:02.719 can be on a scale of up to 20 to 25 tons
01:43:06.000 uh in weight
01:43:07.520 and and which have curious features
01:43:10.000 which have been interpreted variously as
01:43:11.840 polynesian
01:43:13.520 african
01:43:14.880 don't look like classic native american
01:43:17.199 features
01:43:18.320 but one of the things one of the things
01:43:19.920 i've realized is that there is no
01:43:22.159 classic native american feature that the
01:43:24.639 native americans are a very have a very
01:43:27.600 complex genetic story with very many
01:43:30.080 different elements
01:43:31.679 brought into it and we shouldn't be
01:43:33.040 necessarily surprised by the supposedly
01:43:35.199 non-native american look
01:43:38.400 what do we think those helmets were that
01:43:39.840 they were wearing
01:43:41.040 nobody knows because no physical example
01:43:44.000 of such a helmet has ever been found
01:43:45.520 just like no physical example of an
01:43:47.280 egyptian pharaoh's helm a crown has ever
01:43:49.679 been found all we see is the stone the
01:43:51.760 stone reproductions of them do they
01:43:54.000 universally wear these helmets
01:43:56.239 they pretty much all wear these helmets
01:43:58.080 in in in the olmec stone work there's
01:44:01.040 another fascinating figure from laventa
01:44:05.040 one one of the olmec sites which is the
01:44:08.080 earliest ever image of a plumed or
01:44:11.520 feathered serpent the feathered serpent
01:44:13.600 is a famous icon in central america
01:44:16.239 quetzalcoatl who's the the god of peace
01:44:19.119 the bringer of civilization
01:44:21.920 who is associated for example with the
01:44:24.000 famous um pyramid of kukulkan which is
01:44:26.880 just another name for quetzalcoatl at
01:44:28.639 chichen itza where on the spring equinox
01:44:31.119 a shadow effect creates the image of a
01:44:33.520 serpent
01:44:34.480 coiling down the stairway and joining
01:44:36.719 with the carved head of the serpent
01:44:38.400 there's the the image from lavender
01:44:40.080 that's the earliest image of a plume
01:44:41.520 serpent uh in the americas
01:44:44.800 and sitting in the middle of it and i
01:44:46.320 made a big deal out of this because i
01:44:47.679 think it is a big deal in magicians of
01:44:49.199 the gods sitting in the middle of it is
01:44:50.960 this human figure who's holding this
01:44:53.199 strange bag in his hand and
01:44:56.320 it's just a fact that those identical
01:44:58.880 bags are found in ancient sumer in the
01:45:01.520 hands of individuals who were considered
01:45:03.360 to be civilization bringers and they
01:45:05.679 also show up on pillar 43 at gobekli
01:45:08.800 tepi
01:45:09.920 i call them man bags and in that case at
01:45:12.239 gabelli tepe we know they're at least 11
01:45:14.239 600 years old so i wonder if we're
01:45:16.080 looking at a sort of badge of office of
01:45:17.679 a group of civilizers who traveled
01:45:19.199 around the world trying to bring back to
01:45:21.360 life a lost civilization and passed down
01:45:24.320 i deploy a concept in this book that i
01:45:26.480 actually got from richard dawkins
01:45:28.719 richard richard dawkins is the author of
01:45:30.400 the book called the selfish gene and
01:45:32.400 he's not one of my favorite people
01:45:34.000 because he's a he's a materialist
01:45:36.000 reductionist and he doesn't believe in
01:45:38.080 spirit or or any mystery in life that
01:45:39.920 we're just accidents of chemistry and
01:45:41.760 biology he also has no psychedelic
01:45:44.000 experience and he said no i did
01:45:45.360 challenge him at a public event to to go
01:45:47.440 to go have a dozen sessions of ayahuasca
01:45:49.440 and still take acid once oh just once it
01:45:51.840 would be enough but he has an excellent
01:45:53.520 out because and sadly he's had he's had
01:45:55.679 a stroke so he has a good excuse for not
01:45:57.920 for not doing that but
01:45:59.440 he's a clever man and one of his
01:46:01.199 concepts that he's introduced into human
01:46:03.040 culture is the concept of the meme
01:46:05.520 we're all i think familiar with that
01:46:07.119 word genes are
01:46:09.199 physical reproductive mechanisms they
01:46:11.119 reproduce themselves down the
01:46:12.960 generations they replicate they multiply
01:46:15.040 they're passed on from one individual to
01:46:16.719 another memes are cultural objects
01:46:18.560 cultural ideas that are passed on and
01:46:20.880 replicate and reproduce themselves and
01:46:23.119 what i see
01:46:24.320 right across the americas and right
01:46:26.480 across the old world as well is a set of
01:46:28.960 memes that involve the sky that involve
01:46:32.239 the ground that involve geometry that
01:46:34.880 involve notions of life after death
01:46:37.440 and i think the only way to explain
01:46:39.440 these is that they have been inherited
01:46:41.840 from an earlier culture that was in some
01:46:43.840 way connected with the ancestors of all
01:46:46.480 of these all of these cultures i think
01:46:48.159 that's what we're looking at in the
01:46:49.280 amazon we're looking at a meme which was
01:46:51.360 deliberately created once you mobilize a
01:46:54.080 population to start creating huge
01:46:56.480 geometrical structures you are also
01:46:58.880 facilitating many other possibilities
01:47:00.960 that an organized population allows i
01:47:03.600 think that's what happened at quebec
01:47:04.960 litepe i think that's why they created
01:47:06.960 the megalithic site there to mobilize
01:47:09.280 the local population of hunter-gatherers
01:47:11.440 to give them a project to do to engage
01:47:13.840 them and in the process of engaging them
01:47:16.239 to teach them the skills of agriculture
01:47:18.719 which were which which are fundamental
01:47:20.560 to to any concept of of civilization and
01:47:22.960 it's weird the way agriculture just
01:47:24.560 suddenly appears in in quebec tepe and
01:47:28.080 there's huge agricultural mysteries in
01:47:30.480 the amazon as well
01:47:32.880 um may i share a couple of those
01:47:34.960 mysteries with you before you do that
01:47:36.480 though can you pull up that image uh
01:47:38.159 from gobekli tepe of pillar was it a 433
01:47:42.000 in enclosure d
01:47:43.440 i would like to see that that guy
01:47:45.119 holding that bag that's that is really
01:47:47.199 funny
01:47:48.480 the bags are in a row along the top of
01:47:50.239 the pillar
01:47:51.280 um
01:47:53.199 it's pillar 43 in in in enclosure d i'd
01:47:55.760 go back to tapi is there uh an image of
01:47:58.080 that online that's available oh okay
01:47:59.600 here we go
01:48:00.880 yeah there's the bag so there's the bags
01:48:02.880 in a row in a row along the top it's the
01:48:05.440 same sort of square shaped bag with a
01:48:07.280 curved handle that you find on the
01:48:09.199 earliest image of the pillow of the
01:48:10.719 feathered serpent and that you find no
01:48:12.639 you have to go above that jamie
01:48:15.840 just a little bit higher up the pillar
01:48:17.440 those bags right yeah right right at the
01:48:19.360 top there um it's odd that this symbol
01:48:21.760 crops up in in many different cultures
01:48:23.760 and tends to be associated with what's
01:48:25.520 the mainstream interpretation of those
01:48:27.360 there is no mainstream interpretation of
01:48:28.880 those banks
01:48:29.920 that's my interpretation of those bags
01:48:32.800 which i which i freely confess that's
01:48:34.320 how that's how i read them i'm intrigued
01:48:36.080 by the anomaly that the similar bag and
01:48:38.000 turns up in the hands of the
01:48:39.119 quetzalcoatl figure and turns up in
01:48:41.280 mesopotamia repeatedly um in in the
01:48:44.480 hands of the individual so called the
01:48:45.920 apkalu the the magicians of the gods the
01:48:48.480 beginner bringers of civilization and
01:48:50.080 the plume serpent quetzalcoatl was it's
01:48:52.480 an aztec card right and quest
01:48:54.480 equestriatal is an aztec is an aztec god
01:48:57.040 but but the aztecs acquired him from
01:48:59.360 earlier cultures the very fact that an
01:49:01.040 image of the plumed serpent is given
01:49:02.719 such priority in all mech culture tells
01:49:05.520 us that that system of ideas was present
01:49:07.520 during all mech times which takes us
01:49:09.600 back at least to 1500 bc probably quite
01:49:13.360 a bit earlier than that whereas the
01:49:14.560 aztecs are 1500 a.d so there's 3 000
01:49:18.080 years between the aztecs and the olmecs
01:49:19.920 and that same system of ideas is running
01:49:22.400 through all of those cultures and the
01:49:24.080 mayans had a name for it as well
01:49:25.760 kukulkan and what do you think that
01:49:28.320 plume serpent was
01:49:30.000 i think he's
01:49:31.199 it's very clear from from the accounts
01:49:33.360 that have survived that what he's
01:49:34.560 associated with are two things in
01:49:36.719 particular
01:49:37.920 one of them he's a god of peace he's not
01:49:40.320 a war god and the and the other thing
01:49:44.080 that he's primarily about is
01:49:46.719 giving the gifts of civilization this is
01:49:49.119 what you human beings need to know in
01:49:52.000 order to move on to the next level uh
01:49:55.040 that is that is the function and the
01:49:56.960 role of quetzalcoatl and it's there are
01:49:59.440 very similar we could refer to them as
01:50:02.080 civilizing heroes who are found in other
01:50:05.040 cultures and other locations osiris in
01:50:07.360 egypt plays that role
01:50:09.520 as a bringer of civilization there's
01:50:11.520 hardly a culture in the ancient world
01:50:13.440 that doesn't remember a time
01:50:15.520 far back in remote prehistory when some
01:50:19.280 kind of supernaturals or advanced human
01:50:22.560 beings and i prefer the latter that some
01:50:25.040 kind of advanced human beings were
01:50:27.360 involved in a project to disseminate a
01:50:30.480 civilization i mentioned the
01:50:32.400 tucano in the amazon who who are
01:50:35.679 big drinkers of
01:50:37.199 of ayahuasca
01:50:39.040 the tucano have a fascinating origin
01:50:40.960 myth
01:50:41.760 uh they say that their and they the
01:50:44.000 origin myth states specifically that
01:50:46.239 their ancestors were brought to the
01:50:48.400 amazon they were brought to the amazon
01:50:50.880 by a group of supernaturals who included
01:50:53.840 the daughter of the sun and an
01:50:55.840 individual called the helmsman who
01:50:58.080 steered the serpent canoe in which this
01:51:00.800 settlement mission in the amazon was was
01:51:02.719 performed and what these so-called
01:51:04.239 supernaturals did was they brought the
01:51:06.400 ancestors of ducano to the amazon and
01:51:08.560 they showed them the best places to
01:51:10.080 settle the best places where they where
01:51:12.239 they might find hunting the best places
01:51:13.760 where they might create a village the
01:51:15.040 best places for agriculture and then
01:51:17.280 they left
01:51:18.400 but they left them behind one gift and
01:51:20.560 that gift was ayahuasca wow
01:51:23.520 that's the story of the origin myth of
01:51:25.119 the tucano and it sounds to me
01:51:28.480 rather like the other side of the story
01:51:30.480 of that dna signal in the amazon that a
01:51:32.960 group of people were deliberately
01:51:34.560 settled uh in the amazon by human beings
01:51:38.080 who they chose to regard as uh as
01:51:41.440 supernaturals that's that's what makes
01:51:43.040 sense of it to me um when i interrupted
01:51:45.280 you to talk about quetzalcoatl what were
01:51:47.440 you about to say i can't remember
01:51:49.280 i'm in california i've been smoking lots
01:51:50.960 of dope you know
01:51:54.480 we were talking about different things
01:51:55.840 in the amazon should we rewind and
01:51:57.520 figure out what we said yeah the serpent
01:51:58.960 god you were talking about uh before
01:52:00.840 quetzalcoatl before that
01:52:03.119 um i have another question the almex did
01:52:05.760 you were talking about the genetics of
01:52:07.840 these um uh people that live in native
01:52:10.400 americans that they vary widely but the
01:52:13.199 olmecs seem to have very similar
01:52:15.440 features the thick lips the wide noses
01:52:18.080 why do we think that is well this is
01:52:21.440 part of a
01:52:22.639 curious mystery that is not unconnected
01:52:25.280 to the genetic mystery it's been known
01:52:28.320 by archaeologists for quite a long time
01:52:30.719 that there are anomalous
01:52:32.960 skulls
01:52:34.400 in parts of brazil
01:52:36.639 which
01:52:37.679 appear to show
01:52:39.760 very strongly polynesian or african
01:52:43.040 features very much like the features
01:52:45.199 that we see on the on the olmec heads
01:52:48.320 and a number of archaeologists who got
01:52:49.920 into trouble with their colleagues for
01:52:51.440 this have used that to argue many years
01:52:53.920 ago 30 40 years ago that that the
01:52:56.719 settlement story of the americas is much
01:52:58.639 more complicated uh than we've you know
01:53:01.440 than we than we've realized and and what
01:53:04.239 the what the dna is doing is uh it's
01:53:07.360 telling us that there was something
01:53:09.520 really weird uh happened happened with
01:53:11.840 settlement
01:53:12.880 they you see what happened with those um
01:53:16.239 african or polynesian-looking skulls was
01:53:19.360 that they were tested for dna
01:53:22.560 when dna technology was not as advanced
01:53:25.360 as it is today and what that dna showed
01:53:28.400 was that they were more closely related
01:53:30.320 to modern native americans than they are
01:53:32.800 to any other people in the world so the
01:53:35.040 notion that there was some connection
01:53:36.320 with polynesia or africa was dismissed
01:53:40.080 but now that we have very firm evidence
01:53:43.280 of an australasian genetic signal
01:53:46.320 australian aborigines papua new guinea
01:53:48.880 melanesians with those kind of features
01:53:51.440 now that we have the genetic evidence
01:53:52.960 that is found in the amazon we have to
01:53:54.320 go back to that old evidence and and
01:53:56.000 reconsider it
01:53:57.440 wow yeah i would love to find out what
01:54:00.560 that is
01:54:01.520 they've always fascinated me the the
01:54:03.199 olmecs it's always been such a strange
01:54:06.159 image the the large heads with the
01:54:08.800 helmets on them and how
01:54:10.639 do they universally look like that i
01:54:12.400 mean all the all of the features are
01:54:14.239 very very similar they're very very very
01:54:16.239 similar and always with the helmets and
01:54:18.719 almost always i won't claim that every
01:54:20.960 single olmec head has a helmet of it
01:54:22.480 because i think i've seen one that
01:54:23.760 didn't it's quite a while ago since i
01:54:26.159 explored the the olmec area but what's
01:54:28.320 fascinating about them is they are they
01:54:30.400 are supposedly the first high
01:54:31.840 civilization of central america that
01:54:33.679 they create structures on a massive
01:54:35.280 scale that you can see connections
01:54:37.760 between them and the later the later
01:54:39.599 maya that whole mystery of the mayan
01:54:41.199 calendar was clearly inherited from the
01:54:43.280 olmecs it wasn't something the maya made
01:54:45.199 up the olmecs used that same symbolism
01:54:47.679 so the mayan calendar is actually an
01:54:50.080 allmec calendar and if we then consider
01:54:52.639 the possibility that the olmecs may just
01:54:54.560 be the latest the the earliest surviving
01:54:56.880 manifestation of that calendar it could
01:54:58.480 go back much further than that
01:55:01.040 do you plan on having any debates with
01:55:03.440 people that oppose these ideas
01:55:06.159 um well it was interesting on
01:55:08.159 your very show joe to
01:55:10.560 to have the debate that involved michael
01:55:12.880 shermer who's the editor of the skeptic
01:55:15.280 magazine and
01:55:17.599 some colleague of his who came in on
01:55:20.480 line yeah who i got a bit annoyed with
01:55:23.119 um and and myself and uh my great friend
01:55:26.960 and colleague the genius randall carson
01:55:29.599 uh and and um i felt that that was
01:55:32.480 a very useful uh debate
01:55:35.040 um i felt that it's possibly the first
01:55:37.360 time that those of us on the alternative
01:55:39.920 side of the argument about history were
01:55:42.320 given an opportunity really to put our
01:55:44.239 evidence forward and and to confront
01:55:46.639 so-called skeptics uh well it's so cold
01:55:49.440 that's what he calls himself
01:55:51.199 my michael sharma with this evidence and
01:55:53.840 obviously i'm biased but i i don't feel
01:55:57.040 that he fielded the situation
01:55:59.520 particularly well i don't think
01:56:00.880 mainstream archaeology came out of that
01:56:02.719 looking really good i think it came out
01:56:05.040 of that looking rather ignorant and uh
01:56:07.199 and uninformed uh and and a man like
01:56:10.639 michael shermer who is a professional
01:56:13.119 skeptic uh cannot begin to match the
01:56:16.080 knowledge of a man like randall carson
01:56:18.159 who has devoted his whole life to
01:56:20.400 walking the walk of the geology
01:56:23.119 of the end of the ice age in in in north
01:56:25.199 america and that showed on on that
01:56:27.520 debate so i think the debate was worth
01:56:29.520 doing uh i think it showed that the
01:56:31.679 alternative side isn't just wishy-washy
01:56:34.159 stuff out there on the fringes of things
01:56:36.400 that there are those of us working in
01:56:37.679 this field who are using really solid
01:56:40.080 information and who are who our project
01:56:42.560 is to rewrite history and we're not
01:56:44.480 going to do that with slight information
01:56:46.639 it has to be solid information i think
01:56:48.480 we had the opportunity on your show to
01:56:51.360 to say that that that solid information
01:56:53.599 is there i'm not claiming it was a
01:56:55.280 complete victory for the alternative
01:56:57.199 side michael sherman is a smart guy and
01:56:59.440 he put forward some good arguments too
01:57:01.520 and there were constructive aspects of
01:57:03.119 that debate which i which i appreciated
01:57:05.040 i'd like to see much more engagement and
01:57:07.520 much more positive approach i wish the
01:57:09.360 skeptics welcome to their skepticism but
01:57:11.760 i wish they'd be less hateful less less
01:57:14.560 full of derision less less despising
01:57:17.119 well they're so defensive with their
01:57:18.719 ideas and and so and so defensive with
01:57:21.040 their ideas when the possibility is
01:57:22.560 there for for a constructive uh debate
01:57:26.320 you know well what's interesting to me
01:57:28.480 is that as this evidence piles up and it
01:57:30.880 seems to be continuing to pile up as
01:57:33.119 more like the the these impact sites and
01:57:37.119 more of this uh ancient civilization
01:57:40.639 material gets unearthed it's almost
01:57:43.199 insurmountable yeah it's almost and this
01:57:45.040 is how this is how paradigms shift i
01:57:47.199 mean everybody's familiar with the
01:57:48.639 concept of a paradigm shift and and
01:57:50.880 there's a book called the structure of
01:57:52.639 scientific revolutions by thomas kuhn
01:57:54.639 which outlines what a paradigm shift is
01:57:57.040 where
01:57:57.840 an established model in some discipline
01:58:00.719 of science that has been in control of
01:58:02.639 people's thinking for a very long time
01:58:04.880 suddenly falls apart and it doesn't fall
01:58:07.199 apart suddenly what happens is that
01:58:09.119 there's an accumulation of evidence
01:58:11.280 which that model cannot explain that
01:58:13.679 paradigm cannot explain it it seemed
01:58:15.360 like a great paradigm at one point but
01:58:17.599 then it doesn't explain this and then it
01:58:20.000 doesn't explain like like the paradigm
01:58:22.239 that says that megalithic architecture
01:58:23.840 is only six thousand years old and that
01:58:25.520 the first megalithic architecture was in
01:58:27.119 malta that can't explain the massive
01:58:29.599 megalithic site of gobekli tepe in
01:58:31.280 turkey 5 500 years before that it's
01:58:34.639 evidence like that the slow accumulation
01:58:36.560 of evidence that the existing system
01:58:38.239 cannot explain that at eventual point no
01:58:41.280 matter how strongly the advocates of the
01:58:43.360 existing system hold on to it no matter
01:58:45.920 how determined they are in their defense
01:58:48.159 no matter what dirty tricks they may
01:58:50.239 choose to deploy to undermine their
01:58:52.239 opponents sooner or later the evidence
01:58:54.480 overwhelms them and the paradigm goes
01:58:56.719 down and you have a new way of thinking
01:58:59.199 and that that is the story of science
01:59:01.679 and it is a story that i think i think
01:59:03.440 we're at a tipping point in our
01:59:05.599 understanding of the past of the human
01:59:07.119 species i am not saying that i am 100
01:59:10.320 right i believe that what what i'm doing
01:59:12.560 that's worthwhile is i'm asking
01:59:14.400 questions about the past that haven't
01:59:16.080 been asked enough i'm putting
01:59:17.920 archaeologists on the spot and demanding
01:59:20.159 that they explain themselves i don't i
01:59:23.440 don't claim that i'm right i'm offering
01:59:24.880 an alternative theory and my objective
01:59:27.199 is to get people to think for themselves
01:59:29.199 to think about this stuff and not to
01:59:30.880 accept
01:59:31.920 the voice of authority as the as the
01:59:34.080 soul
01:59:35.599 medium of truth that's that's what i've
01:59:37.599 tried to do have you had uh any uh
01:59:40.800 archaeologists review any of this work
01:59:42.960 and change their opinions
01:59:44.400 no
01:59:45.280 no i haven't but what i what i have
01:59:48.000 found uh and i've i found it
01:59:50.000 interestingly during the research trips
01:59:52.159 for america before
01:59:54.000 uh is a younger generation of
01:59:55.920 archaeologists who are in the field
01:59:58.800 and they are quite different from the
02:00:01.119 older generation of archaeologists who
02:00:02.719 were running the whole scene 25 years
02:00:04.639 ago of course now we have a very
02:00:06.159 different younger generation a younger
02:00:07.599 generation that has been exposed to
02:00:09.520 open-minded thinking
02:00:11.599 that has been exposed to the internet
02:00:13.760 that itself as part of the general
02:00:15.679 pattern of the younger generation is
02:00:17.280 suspicious of authority i'm meeting
02:00:19.360 young archaeologists on sites for
02:00:20.719 example i met a couple of really amazing
02:00:22.719 young minds
02:00:24.320 on a site called um blackwater draw uh
02:00:27.440 in um uh arizona uh new mexico where
02:00:30.639 where the one of the first clovis sites
02:00:32.960 the young archaeologists i met there
02:00:35.119 were incredibly open-minded and and
02:00:37.679 really willing to consider extraordinary
02:00:39.920 possibilities about the past and
02:00:41.440 privately admitted to me that they'd
02:00:42.880 read my books
02:00:44.719 well that's where i get the hope i get
02:00:46.719 the hope in this young generation that
02:00:48.159 is growing up with the internet that
02:00:49.360 does understand that there's a lot more
02:00:51.920 out there than just what they're being
02:00:53.440 taught in schools yes yeah this is this
02:00:56.400 this is where the where the hope lies
02:00:58.239 and it lies in in every area and it's
02:01:00.080 why
02:01:01.199 one of the one of the intriguing things
02:01:03.440 that has happened with me and your show
02:01:06.239 is an important part of this is that
02:01:08.719 when i go around
02:01:10.239 giving public events doing a public
02:01:12.560 presentation
02:01:14.159 of my work
02:01:15.520 the demography of the audience is is
02:01:17.599 extremely interesting and this is true
02:01:19.040 whether i'm giving the talk in britain
02:01:20.800 whether i'm giving it in canada whether
02:01:22.639 i'm giving it in america part of the
02:01:24.719 audience are older people who read me in
02:01:27.280 the 1990s who got onto my work with
02:01:29.760 fingerprints of the gods in 1995 and
02:01:31.679 they've stuck with me and they've
02:01:33.199 carried on reading my work but another
02:01:36.239 part of the audience a very big part of
02:01:38.000 the audience consists to a large extent
02:01:41.119 of young people most of whom are men but
02:01:43.199 there are women amongst them as well
02:01:45.520 and what those
02:01:47.119 mainly young men come up to me and say
02:01:49.599 at the end of the event is
02:01:52.320 we first encountered your work on joe
02:01:54.080 rogan's show
02:01:55.360 and
02:01:56.159 it completely opened our minds it
02:01:58.239 changed it i've had so many young men
02:02:00.560 say this has changed my life and then i
02:02:03.119 asked myself well why should a different
02:02:04.880 take on the past change people's lives
02:02:07.440 why should people feel that their lives
02:02:08.880 have been changed by a different take on
02:02:10.400 the past which i add they would not know
02:02:12.400 about unless you'd had the good grace to
02:02:14.560 to bring me on on your show these ideas
02:02:16.880 would not be known but they are known
02:02:18.560 because of the amazing outreach of your
02:02:20.239 show and the answer to that question why
02:02:22.480 does it why does it change a person's
02:02:24.320 life is that once we realize
02:02:27.840 that we have been misinformed about our
02:02:31.760 past
02:02:32.880 that everything that we've built our
02:02:34.560 idea of who we are upon and of where
02:02:37.360 we're going as a culture may be founded
02:02:39.840 on
02:02:40.560 falsehoods and perhaps even deliberate
02:02:43.679 lies once that is realized
02:02:46.480 then all the questions about the nature
02:02:48.719 of the society we live in become open
02:02:51.199 and and people young people are feeling
02:02:54.080 the need to take an independent path not
02:02:56.560 to not to follow the path that has been
02:02:58.639 set down for them uh by by previous
02:03:01.440 generations and in some way and i'm very
02:03:03.760 gratified to hear this the fact that i
02:03:06.080 i'm an elder now i'm 69 next next
02:03:08.639 birthday the fact that i look great
02:03:11.199 thank you the fact that i as an elder um
02:03:14.239 have
02:03:15.040 consistently pursued an independent past
02:03:17.440 apart have been
02:03:18.880 willing to put up with the [ __ ] that's
02:03:21.440 been thrown at me over the years but
02:03:24.000 have stuck to my guns and have continued
02:03:26.239 to add new information to the dossier of
02:03:28.560 information that i put forward that is
02:03:30.960 and i'm encouraged to see this that's
02:03:32.560 found as inspiring by younger people and
02:03:34.719 what what better gift could an old guy
02:03:37.520 hope to leave to the world than a
02:03:39.760 younger generation who feel inspired by
02:03:41.599 that person's work to change the world
02:03:43.920 well i'm very very thankful that i could
02:03:46.080 introduce people to you because your
02:03:48.239 first book that i read of you
02:03:50.159 fingerprints of the gods changed my view
02:03:51.920 of the world i mean i remember putting
02:03:54.080 that book down after i was finishing
02:03:55.440 going wow like if if he's right like
02:03:58.880 this whole thing is a mess yeah
02:04:01.280 a complete mess
02:04:02.719 because our idea of who we are
02:04:04.719 is very much founded in our idea of who
02:04:06.719 we were
02:04:08.000 and and one of i think one of the
02:04:09.360 mistakes that's made in our civilization
02:04:12.400 is that uh
02:04:13.840 we are very conceited we're very big
02:04:15.760 headed and we tend to review the
02:04:18.159 view the whole story of history as
02:04:20.159 though it's a project that leads to us
02:04:22.320 that we're what it's all about and i
02:04:24.400 think what is um
02:04:26.400 what is uh how can i put it undermining
02:04:29.840 of the existing system
02:04:31.599 about
02:04:32.639 a new take on uh the past is is is the
02:04:36.320 notion that we're not what it's all
02:04:38.480 about at all uh that there may have been
02:04:41.119 an earlier civilization that reached a
02:04:43.440 high level of advancement perhaps
02:04:45.040 different from ours but nevertheless an
02:04:46.800 advanced civilization which was just
02:04:49.040 taken out of the story completely by a
02:04:51.840 global cataclysm uh then we suddenly we
02:04:54.719 suddenly realize that in a way we're
02:04:56.239 here accidentally that it's not been a
02:04:58.000 process that's been all about us uh and
02:05:00.800 and that if we've been misinformed about
02:05:02.800 how we got here then we need to get the
02:05:04.960 true information about about what's
02:05:07.199 going on so so these are um in a way
02:05:10.320 profoundly revolutionary ideas they do
02:05:12.480 they do lead people on a path of inquiry
02:05:14.960 that leads to questioning of everything
02:05:17.280 and our fears that you were just
02:05:19.520 discussing earlier about how soft we are
02:05:23.040 in comparison to past civilizations in
02:05:25.679 terms of like our ability to live off
02:05:27.280 the land
02:05:28.239 that's one aspect that bothers me but
02:05:30.800 one of the big ones that bothers me is
02:05:32.239 the fact that everything is digital all
02:05:34.239 of our information is stored on hard
02:05:35.760 drives you bet and if that goes down
02:05:38.960 there's not much left you have paper
02:05:41.119 books and and you know a few thousands
02:05:44.159 of years
02:05:45.760 imagine what would be left yeah we would
02:05:48.080 lose all of our advancement well i can i
02:05:50.639 can speak to this at a at a personal
02:05:52.960 level there was a time when i was an
02:05:55.440 excellent map reader
02:05:57.119 i i i could navigate anywhere with with
02:06:00.560 maps you know my wife santa and i did
02:06:02.800 huge journeys in mexico back in the
02:06:04.560 early 1990s in really cheap hire cars
02:06:07.920 with maps and we found our way
02:06:10.080 everywhere without any problem today
02:06:13.199 i can hardly use a map the skill of
02:06:15.520 using a map has lapsed within me why
02:06:18.159 because of gps gps technology has come
02:06:20.960 along and it's and it always tells me
02:06:23.679 where i am and
02:06:25.440 being a bit lazy
02:06:27.199 i just accept that that technology but
02:06:29.760 then i
02:06:30.639 had caused to ask myself this just the
02:06:32.239 other day supposing gps supposing all
02:06:34.400 the satellites go down and there's no no
02:06:36.239 gps is the whole the whole
02:06:37.920 industrialized human race is going to
02:06:39.440 suddenly be lost uh all those uber
02:06:41.840 drivers who don't know their way from a
02:06:43.840 to b and who rely entirely on their
02:06:45.679 gps's they won't know they won't know
02:06:47.520 where they're going and it's and it's
02:06:49.040 true with digital data the digi digital
02:06:51.520 data unlike unlike print data
02:06:54.560 is um very fragile
02:06:57.119 and requires programs in order to access
02:06:59.520 and interpret it that are much more
02:07:01.280 complicated than simply cracking the
02:07:03.119 code of a lost language i mean the
02:07:05.040 programs vary between different phone
02:07:07.199 platforms exactly they vary in computer
02:07:09.280 platforms it's just
02:07:10.880 it's so fragile and it's so uh i mean i
02:07:13.840 don't know if there's any precautions
02:07:15.119 that have been taking place to preserve
02:07:16.400 this information in case of like what
02:07:18.560 robert shock described coronal mass
02:07:20.719 ejection or something down all the
02:07:22.400 satellites yeah no i don't think i don't
02:07:24.159 think preparation has been made and i
02:07:25.840 don't and i don't and it's very clear
02:07:27.599 that that preparation is not being made
02:07:30.239 for the risk of uh another uh cosmic
02:07:33.280 impact
02:07:34.320 um
02:07:35.280 and again a point that i'd like to make
02:07:37.520 about this is that we are
02:07:40.000 we are in a sense in a place where
02:07:41.760 history can repeat itself uh that there
02:07:44.960 are certain cycles at work
02:07:47.440 uh the work on the comet impact 12 800
02:07:50.880 years ago
02:07:52.560 has very clearly and specifically
02:07:54.560 identified the debris trail of that
02:07:57.199 comet and that debris trail is the
02:07:59.760 taurid meteor stream and it's called the
02:08:02.480 torrid meteor stream because it appears
02:08:04.320 to emanate from the region of the sky in
02:08:06.000 which the constellation of taurus sits
02:08:08.960 it doesn't it's within our solar system
02:08:10.800 it's an optical illusion
02:08:12.719 the torrid meteor stream is a giant
02:08:15.520 complex of debris
02:08:17.760 it is 30 million kilometers wide what
02:08:21.440 you had was an original comet that might
02:08:23.920 have been 100 to 200 kilometers in
02:08:26.560 diameter a small moon which fragmented
02:08:29.520 and broke up into multiple multiple
02:08:31.679 parts and those parts began to spread
02:08:34.159 out along the whole orbit of the torrid
02:08:36.320 meteor stream and to widen the whole
02:08:38.800 thing widened so it's like a giant tube
02:08:40.800 of debris and the evidence and the
02:08:42.880 argument is that 12 800 years ago
02:08:45.679 several large bits of that debris fell
02:08:48.320 out of the torrid meteor stream and
02:08:50.239 impacted with the earth the problem is
02:08:52.639 that the torrid meteor stream still
02:08:54.560 exists and our planet still passes
02:08:57.360 through it twice a year
02:08:59.599 and those passages take place in june
02:09:02.159 and in november and each passage takes
02:09:04.639 12 and a half days
02:09:06.320 and the same group of scientists who are
02:09:08.480 who are looking at the evidence for the
02:09:10.079 impacts 12 800 years ago are deeply
02:09:13.280 concerned that we may face future
02:09:15.520 impacts from the tory meteor stream that
02:09:17.679 there are still large objects up there
02:09:19.840 this is not theory this is a fact
02:09:21.280 there's a comet up there uh called comet
02:09:23.920 enki which is part of the torrid meteor
02:09:26.400 stream it's a large fragment of the
02:09:28.320 original giant comet comet enki has a
02:09:30.400 diameter of i don't know five or five or
02:09:32.159 six kilometers there's there's 19
02:09:34.960 recognized huge objects within the
02:09:36.880 toried meteor stream calculations
02:09:38.560 indicate that there may be as much as
02:09:40.079 200 asteroids within the toried meteor
02:09:42.800 stream uh of a diameter of a kilometer
02:09:45.119 or more which would have catastrophic
02:09:46.880 effect if they if they hit the earth and
02:09:48.960 responsible astronomers regard the
02:09:50.960 torrid meteor stream as the greatest
02:09:52.719 collision hazard facing mankind at the
02:09:54.400 present time and it's not something that
02:09:57.199 we need to fall into despair about
02:09:59.440 because it's perfectly within the level
02:10:01.679 of our technology to do something about
02:10:04.159 it what could they do well
02:10:06.000 to give you an example uh commercial
02:10:07.920 interests are looking right now and the
02:10:09.360 technology is there to mine asteroids we
02:10:11.679 can go to asteroids if the commercial
02:10:13.840 interest is high enough we can go to
02:10:16.159 them we can mine them we can extract
02:10:17.840 minerals we can bring them back to the
02:10:19.119 earth the same technology would allow
02:10:21.599 you to move asteroids or comet fragments
02:10:24.239 you don't want to
02:10:25.599 blow them up with a nuke that would be a
02:10:27.840 really bad idea that would that would
02:10:30.400 turn
02:10:32.159 one large object into multiple smaller
02:10:34.960 objects which could cause equally
02:10:36.560 massive devastation and and would be
02:10:38.480 very difficult to predict where that
02:10:39.760 devastation was going to fall what you
02:10:41.760 want to do is to nudge them and move
02:10:44.079 them out of the dangerous orbit into
02:10:46.079 into a less dangerous orbit and and the
02:10:48.159 evidence is in the next 30 years we are
02:10:50.000 going to be passing through dangerous
02:10:51.920 filaments of the torrid meteor stream
02:10:53.440 and if we were smart we would be
02:10:55.199 devoting some resources to protecting
02:10:57.760 our cosmic environment just as there are
02:10:59.520 many issues that we need to devote
02:11:01.119 resources to unfortunately the one
02:11:03.920 that's most attractive to our
02:11:05.360 politicians at the moment is warfare
02:11:08.400 we
02:11:09.199 devote limitless resources to
02:11:12.239 technologies of mass destruction there
02:11:14.239 really is no end to the amount that
02:11:16.560 we're prepared to spend on that in terms
02:11:18.480 of our so-called security we feel
02:11:20.079 somehow we're making ourselves more
02:11:21.840 secure by having these incredible
02:11:23.840 weapons and spending trillions of
02:11:26.079 dollars on them but the cosmos doesn't
02:11:28.480 give a [ __ ] about any of that the cosmos
02:11:31.040 is out there with these with these giant
02:11:33.360 giant objects uh which have a far
02:11:36.079 greater explosive power than all the
02:11:37.840 nuclear um
02:11:39.840 weapons stored on earth at the at the
02:11:42.000 present time the comet shoemaker levy 9
02:11:44.400 which hit jupiter in 1994 had a total
02:11:48.400 calculated explosive power of 300
02:11:50.719 gigatons if you took the entire nuclear
02:11:53.440 arsenal of the world today and blew it
02:11:55.119 all up at once it would yield 6.4
02:11:57.440 gigatons so these objects are producing
02:12:00.159 catastrophic results on a scale that far
02:12:02.960 far beyond anything that we ourselves
02:12:04.639 could do with nuclear weapons it's time
02:12:06.480 we spent a bit less time and money on
02:12:09.119 weapons of mass destruction and a bit
02:12:11.040 more on looking after this beautiful
02:12:12.639 garden that we call the earth and that
02:12:14.800 is our home and it will be the home of
02:12:16.480 our children and our children's children
02:12:18.239 i'm a grandfather now i feel
02:12:19.840 passionately about this we need to look
02:12:21.920 after this planet it's our
02:12:23.360 responsibility as a human species to do
02:12:25.840 so and one of the challenges it's not
02:12:27.679 the only challenge there are many many
02:12:29.599 other challenges one of the challenges
02:12:31.440 is to pay attention to our cosmic
02:12:33.840 environment and to realize that the
02:12:36.480 cosmos can intervene
02:12:38.679 cataclysmically in the human story and
02:12:41.040 that the toried meteor stream in
02:12:42.480 particular may have been a hidden hand
02:12:44.320 in human history that there may have
02:12:45.599 been other impacts in the last 13 000
02:12:47.679 years that affect have affected and
02:12:49.679 changed the course of humanity on this
02:12:52.000 earth and the ancients were very good at
02:12:54.560 paying attention to the sky
02:12:56.480 we ourselves have amazing tech to study
02:12:59.199 the sky but for some reason we're
02:13:00.719 ignoring this problem of cosmic impacts
02:13:03.520 and that's incredibly irresponsible
02:13:05.280 because as i said a moment ago it is a
02:13:07.599 solvable problem it is within the limits
02:13:10.159 of our technology it would require a
02:13:12.639 global cooperative effort to sweep our
02:13:15.040 cosmic environment clean but it could be
02:13:17.280 done and a side product of that global
02:13:19.440 corporation might be a friendlier more
02:13:21.920 nurturing more loving more positive
02:13:24.239 human community
02:13:25.760 it is very odd that we have this
02:13:28.480 infantile nature even as grown adults
02:13:30.960 and world leaders
02:13:32.320 that we don't we do like to ignore
02:13:35.119 imminent danger as long as it hasn't
02:13:37.199 affected us in the past yes
02:13:39.440 there's no real moment we can point to
02:13:42.159 other than tunguska
02:13:44.480 in you know photographic history modern
02:13:46.800 history where you could take pictures of
02:13:48.159 things
02:13:49.440 if i can if i can pause you on that very
02:13:51.440 point the evidence is compelling that
02:13:53.840 the tunguska event was an object that
02:13:56.239 fell out of the torrid meteor stream
02:13:58.079 that happened at the peak of the beta
02:13:59.760 torrids in june 1908
02:14:02.239 that it's extremely likely that that
02:14:05.520 tunguska object came from the torrid
02:14:07.760 meteor stream because we were passing
02:14:09.280 through the torrid meteor stream at
02:14:10.560 exactly that time and what the tunguska
02:14:13.280 object is estimated to be
02:14:15.199 between 60 and 190 meters in diameter so
02:14:18.239 it's not a very big object it's not a
02:14:19.760 kilometer scale object it's it's it's
02:14:22.480 it's big but it's not that big it
02:14:24.079 doesn't even hit the earth it it's an
02:14:26.239 air burst it explodes in the sky
02:14:29.679 above fortunately an uninhabited area of
02:14:32.880 siberia but the devastation is huge it
02:14:35.760 wasn't even noticed for some years
02:14:37.679 afterwards until scientific teams went
02:14:39.440 in and studied the area and discovered
02:14:41.040 that 80 million trees across 2000 square
02:14:43.520 kilometers had been completely flattened
02:14:46.079 by that air burst
02:14:47.679 and to put that in context 2 000 square
02:14:49.760 kilometers is the size of london so
02:14:52.880 anybody who knows london is aware that
02:14:54.480 there's a ring road around london called
02:14:56.079 the m25 if that airbus had taken place
02:14:58.719 over central london everything of london
02:15:00.719 out as far as the m25 would have been
02:15:02.880 gone completely is that what it looks
02:15:04.880 like today
02:15:06.560 pretty close pretty close it says like
02:15:07.840 100 years later there's still no trees
02:15:09.520 yeah
02:15:11.199 and and if you've got you look above
02:15:12.960 there you're looking at the black and
02:15:14.159 whites that were taken in the early
02:15:15.520 1900s
02:15:17.280 which which revealed the extent of this
02:15:19.199 of
02:15:20.000 of this damage so it's just stupid of us
02:15:22.239 not to pay a bit more attention to this
02:15:23.920 especially when we have the tech to
02:15:25.440 actually do something about it we have
02:15:28.000 that
02:15:28.800 that nature though when it comes to
02:15:30.639 climate change there's a curious denial
02:15:33.440 there's a denial um of the role of
02:15:35.760 cataclysms in the human story and there
02:15:38.000 there is even a word for that in in
02:15:40.079 science and it's called
02:15:41.800 uniformitarianism and and this is a
02:15:43.840 particular philosophy of science where
02:15:45.599 the view is that
02:15:47.199 everything as we see it in the world
02:15:49.040 today is how things have always been so
02:15:51.440 if we don't see cataclysms today and
02:15:53.760 they're not playing a major part in our
02:15:55.679 story today then there weren't
02:15:57.679 cataclysms and they didn't play a major
02:15:59.760 part in our story in the past that's why
02:16:02.400 although it's before the time of human
02:16:03.840 beings when the evidence that the
02:16:06.239 dinosaurs were made extinct by a comet
02:16:08.880 or an asteroid
02:16:10.560 first came out um lewis and walter
02:16:13.119 alvarez the father-son team who were
02:16:14.800 behind that science were ridiculed by
02:16:17.119 their colleagues and they were told it's
02:16:18.400 absolutely absurd of course no cosmic
02:16:21.599 event could have made the dinosaurs
02:16:23.360 extinct they spent 10 years taking that
02:16:25.360 ridicule until they found the crater in
02:16:27.440 the gulf of mexico since then the whole
02:16:30.000 scientific community has accepted that
02:16:32.558 the course of life on this planet was
02:16:35.599 radically changed by a cosmic impact and
02:16:39.200 you know i like to joke about it but it
02:16:41.120 was a cosmic impact that was big enough
02:16:43.359 literally to turn dinosaurs into
02:16:45.519 chickens
02:16:46.718 because that's what's left of the
02:16:48.160 dinosaur line is you know the birds yeah
02:16:51.519 and at the same time
02:16:53.760 skulking in those primeval forests is
02:16:56.240 this little mammal and it looks a bit
02:16:58.160 like a shrew
02:16:59.920 65 million years ago going nowhere
02:17:03.280 the dinosaurs rule the earth then the
02:17:05.439 cosmos intervenes the dinosaurs are
02:17:07.439 swept out of the way and what happens
02:17:08.959 the mammals start to evolve very rapidly
02:17:11.359 and they start to occupy niches that
02:17:12.959 were previously closed to them and the
02:17:15.359 bottom line is we would not be here the
02:17:17.439 human species would not be here we would
02:17:19.040 not be having this conversation if the
02:17:20.959 dinosaurs had not been made extinct 65
02:17:23.359 million years ago
02:17:24.959 so these are world-changing events and
02:17:27.200 my argument is that such a
02:17:28.398 world-changing event occurred between
02:17:30.080 twelve thousand eight hundred and eleven
02:17:31.439 thousand six hundred years ago and it's
02:17:32.799 high time we paid more attention to it
02:17:35.840 is there any evidence that there was
02:17:38.000 other species of human beings that
02:17:40.398 existed in the americas like we're
02:17:42.879 finding in russia
02:17:45.359 and there's
02:17:47.120 many of them that are being discovered
02:17:48.879 all over the world now these sub-species
02:17:51.519 of human beings yeah
02:17:53.760 this is
02:17:55.200 an issue that i go into in in america
02:17:57.519 before
02:17:58.718 and what first drew me into it was
02:18:01.040 dennis over cave uh in siberia
02:18:04.558 i think everybody's heard of the
02:18:05.679 neanderthals and these days i think
02:18:07.280 everybody's heard of the dennis ovens as
02:18:08.718 well a lot of people have it a lot of
02:18:10.240 well i guess a lot of people haven't but
02:18:12.000 but first of all let's take the
02:18:13.519 neanderthals uh for a long time it was
02:18:15.679 held that the neanderthals were stupid
02:18:17.599 primitive sub-humans shambling lacking
02:18:20.558 symbolism turns out that that's not true
02:18:22.799 at all the latest scientific on evidence
02:18:25.200 on the neanderthals is that they were
02:18:26.718 symbolic creatures that they did do art
02:18:28.638 that they were in every sense human and
02:18:30.799 they were in every sense human because
02:18:32.959 anatomically modern humans interbred
02:18:35.200 with neanderthals you can't interbreed
02:18:36.879 with another species they they clearly
02:18:39.359 were uh human beings but they looked
02:18:41.679 rather different from us and that's why
02:18:43.599 certain populations in the world today
02:18:45.920 still have three to five percent of
02:18:48.160 neanderthal uh dna
02:18:50.638 then in russia in denisova cave they
02:18:54.000 find a single pinky bone from a little
02:18:56.398 finger and they do the dna testing on it
02:19:00.000 they're able to get a complete genome
02:19:02.160 from it and what they discover is this
02:19:04.240 isn't a neanderthal this isn't an
02:19:06.478 anatomically modern human being this is
02:19:08.398 another human species uh who they named
02:19:11.679 the denisovans they think they're more
02:19:13.280 closely related to neanderthals than
02:19:15.040 they are to anatomically modern humans
02:19:17.040 but they're clearly another human
02:19:18.398 species and they also interbred with
02:19:22.080 anatomically modern humans and denisovan
02:19:24.160 dna survives interestingly enough it
02:19:26.799 survives
02:19:27.920 predominantly in australasia in papua
02:19:31.280 new guinea and amongst
02:19:33.359 australian aborigines so as part of the
02:19:35.679 research for this book i went to
02:19:38.398 denisova cave i had an amazing actually
02:19:41.200 just incredible trip to russia i hadn't
02:19:43.679 i hadn't expected it to be like that at
02:19:45.760 all siberia i mean america is vast but
02:19:49.200 my god crossing siberia this is endless
02:19:52.720 rolling plains you know this just vast
02:19:55.439 area how did you cross it we
02:19:57.840 took a car
02:19:59.520 you can't travel independently in russia
02:20:01.439 it's very difficult you have to get you
02:20:02.880 have to get permission and you have to
02:20:05.040 state in advance where you're going to
02:20:06.640 be stopping off at so what i found and i
02:20:09.439 just did so through the internet was a
02:20:11.439 was a local guy called sergey kugin
02:20:14.640 who had a little tour business um
02:20:17.439 in in in siberia in the city of
02:20:20.240 novosibirsk i got in touch with him
02:20:23.680 he found a translator who would
02:20:25.280 translate my emails and i said we want
02:20:27.359 to make this journey to dennis over cave
02:20:30.240 and can you set this up for us and get
02:20:31.920 all the permissions and and he did and
02:20:33.520 so we flew into novosibirsk sergey and
02:20:36.399 his uh translator who turned out to be a
02:20:38.720 a russian student who spoke good english
02:20:41.200 joined us and we did this immense
02:20:43.040 journey across siberia
02:20:45.600 oh it took us three days to get to to
02:20:47.520 get to dennis over cave three days
02:20:49.040 driving every day three days of driving
02:20:50.399 every day some stopping off along the
02:20:51.920 way incredible hospitality of the of of
02:20:54.240 the russians that we were amongst very
02:20:56.319 independent people people who are living
02:20:58.319 out there in the wilderness and who
02:21:00.000 actually do do know how to survive is
02:21:02.080 the first time i've ever drunk milk
02:21:03.840 fresh from the cow literally milked
02:21:06.160 right out of the cow and poured down my
02:21:08.000 throat it was it was delicious and the
02:21:10.399 cream i mean thick thick cream very very
02:21:13.200 so there was a lot of things about
02:21:14.160 russia that surprised me dennis over
02:21:16.399 cave is a fascinating beautiful place to
02:21:18.640 visit it's another it's another example
02:21:20.880 of a missing chapter in the human story
02:21:23.040 that is beginning to be pieced together
02:21:24.640 it's obvious now that we were not alone
02:21:27.120 that there were multiple other human
02:21:28.800 species who were human enough to
02:21:30.800 interbreed with us and leave leave dna
02:21:33.680 and this denisovan species was only
02:21:35.359 discovered in like was it 2000 something
02:21:37.280 very recently the 2000s
02:21:39.439 it's a very it's a very recent discovery
02:21:41.600 and and did they really get behind art
02:21:43.840 did they leave behind art better than
02:21:45.600 that they they left behind um certain
02:21:48.720 physical objects
02:21:50.319 which are extremely hard to explain
02:21:53.040 one of them is a green stone bracelet
02:21:57.280 and that bracelet is in the form of a
02:21:59.280 torque which was therefore slipped on
02:22:01.439 sideways onto the hand it's not a full
02:22:03.359 ring
02:22:04.640 and
02:22:05.600 a hole has been drilled through the
02:22:07.439 bracelet
02:22:08.399 and from that hole it's been possible to
02:22:10.399 reconstruct that a pendant was hung then
02:22:13.040 the archaeologists there it is then the
02:22:15.280 archaeologist started to take a look in
02:22:17.680 detail at the drill marks on that hole
02:22:20.960 and what they discovered was a huge
02:22:22.640 anomaly that that was drilled with a
02:22:24.800 stable fixed drill and it was drilled at
02:22:28.080 extremely high speed it's a this is
02:22:31.120 thought to be 40 or 50 000 years old
02:22:33.840 there is not supposed to have been any
02:22:35.760 such technology in that period that was
02:22:37.680 capable of drilling with a stable fixed
02:22:39.840 drill and yet there it is and and and
02:22:42.560 there it appears so there there are also
02:22:45.840 incredible very fine uh needles bone
02:22:48.880 needles that the denisovans made very
02:22:50.720 long ones which suggest that they were
02:22:52.240 stitching very heavy stuff together and
02:22:54.160 the suggestion has been were they making
02:22:56.000 skinned boats for example to to use to
02:22:58.240 navigate that would explain how they
02:22:59.840 managed to get themselves to australia
02:23:02.000 which is where the largest amount of
02:23:03.439 denisovan dna uh
02:23:05.680 survives today there's one of those
02:23:07.520 there's one of those needles so that
02:23:09.200 there are indications of strangely out
02:23:11.920 of place technology amongst the
02:23:13.680 denisovans which is 20 30 000 years
02:23:16.000 earlier in the human story than it than
02:23:17.760 it should be those kind of needles that
02:23:19.680 kind of bracelet you could expect to
02:23:21.439 find them in what archaeologists call
02:23:22.720 the neolithic but to find it in the
02:23:24.800 paleolithic is very puzzling and and
02:23:27.439 very odd and it suggests that the
02:23:28.640 denisovans would certainly not
02:23:31.600 shambling sub subhumans that they they
02:23:33.760 were refined creatures can you find out
02:23:35.520 what year they discovered the dennis
02:23:36.880 ovens jamie can you google that real
02:23:38.319 quick i i want to say it's in the 2000s
02:23:40.880 but i mean
02:23:42.720 imagine that human beings have been
02:23:44.960 around for this long here we are in 2019
02:23:47.600 and within the last decade or so they
02:23:49.600 figured this out yeah we're discovering
02:23:52.080 new stuff about ourself we're
02:23:53.520 discovering that our story is much
02:23:55.359 richer much more textured much more
02:23:58.399 layered than we thought it was it's not
02:24:00.720 a simple story it's a very complicated
02:24:03.439 story and we ourselves
02:24:05.680 are a hybrid species we are we are the
02:24:08.399 result of interactions with all kinds of
02:24:10.960 different looking human beings and the
02:24:12.479 end the end result is ourselves so it's
02:24:14.240 not just that we carry neanderthal or
02:24:16.880 denisovan dna in a sense we are
02:24:19.040 neanderthals and denis servants uh you
02:24:22.479 know and have have
02:24:24.080 they are part of the anatomically modern
02:24:26.720 human heritage so
02:24:28.560 you make a good point the fact that this
02:24:30.240 is only being discovered now and that
02:24:32.319 it's an incredibly important i mean it
02:24:34.240 it completely rewrites the story of our
02:24:36.800 ancestry the notion that the 1970s 1970s
02:24:40.720 oh okay
02:24:41.760 the real work that's been done in dennis
02:24:43.920 over cave has been done in the 2000s
02:24:46.319 from from 2006 2007 on genetic
02:24:49.280 examination that's when the major papers
02:24:51.120 have been 2008 they have been published
02:24:53.760 which have which have revealed the
02:24:55.520 genome of the denisovans and revealed
02:24:57.359 the denisovan connection to to
02:24:59.200 anatomically modern humans the fact that
02:25:01.359 we are only finding this out now that we
02:25:03.439 that we told the story of our past and
02:25:05.359 weren't aware of this raises the
02:25:07.200 question how much else in the story of
02:25:08.800 our past is there that we're not aware
02:25:10.720 of let's stop being so arrogant so sure
02:25:13.200 of ourselves so confident in our
02:25:14.800 findings let's be more tentative let's
02:25:16.720 keep an open mind and see and see where
02:25:19.280 it takes us that's that's the main
02:25:21.359 message that i have from from all of
02:25:22.880 this and i think
02:25:25.120 and i hope
02:25:26.399 that this will be
02:25:27.760 an effect of this book i'm not i'm not
02:25:30.000 kidding myself that the archaeologists
02:25:32.240 are going to
02:25:33.520 jump on board overnight particularly so
02:25:36.240 since i'm very critical of american
02:25:38.880 archaeology in this book and i'm
02:25:41.120 critical of it specifically and
02:25:43.040 explicitly because of the dominance of
02:25:46.000 the clovis first model for so long which
02:25:48.720 prevented other research taking place
02:25:50.880 and i have to say archaeologists like to
02:25:53.600 insult me by calling me a
02:25:56.240 pseudo-scientist
02:25:58.560 i can't think of anything more
02:26:00.359 pseudo-scientific than the clovis first
02:26:02.720 doctrine which locked american
02:26:04.640 archaeology for 50 years in a particular
02:26:07.280 framework which we now know was totally
02:26:09.760 wrong nothing good about it at all
02:26:12.640 a complete mistake
02:26:14.640 what i'm hoping the book will do
02:26:16.960 in the long run is that it will
02:26:19.280 lead to more attention being focused on
02:26:21.600 the americas
02:26:23.040 this is a very neglected area of the
02:26:25.680 world as far as deep and ancient
02:26:28.000 archaeology goes i'm it's the recent
02:26:30.560 history of the americas has been
02:26:32.160 relatively well studied but the deep in
02:26:34.000 ancient history has not been has not
02:26:35.840 been well studied and i think america is
02:26:39.040 going to contain
02:26:40.560 revelations for us about our story and
02:26:43.760 about our past and i'm serious when i
02:26:46.240 when i suggest that america is the most
02:26:50.399 plausible and the most likely
02:26:53.359 home base for a lost civilization if
02:26:55.760 you're going to propose a lost
02:26:56.960 civilization
02:26:58.240 you need there are certain preconditions
02:27:00.240 you need a you can't have it on a small
02:27:02.319 island there's got to be a large land
02:27:04.160 mass with enormous resources and the
02:27:05.840 ability for population to grow and for
02:27:07.600 those resources to be to be mobilized
02:27:10.000 and what i suddenly realized you asked
02:27:11.760 earlier why i why i started to write
02:27:13.520 this book at all is what the new
02:27:15.280 evidence is pointing to is that the
02:27:16.960 americas have been wrongly neglected
02:27:19.200 that here we have a giant continental
02:27:21.120 land mass with extraordinary resources
02:27:24.319 that has just been ruled out of the
02:27:26.399 story of human civilization but once we
02:27:28.319 take account of the fact that there was
02:27:30.800 a giant cataclysm over north america
02:27:34.080 twelve thousand eight hundred years ago
02:27:35.520 and once we start looking as i do in
02:27:37.840 america before at the incredible
02:27:40.560 deep in-depth similarities between for
02:27:43.040 example the religious system of ancient
02:27:45.680 egypt and the religious system of the
02:27:47.439 mississippi valley then you realize that
02:27:49.840 you're into a into a global mystery here
02:27:52.319 and that the answer to that mystery may
02:27:54.319 not at all be in the old world and may
02:27:56.319 very much be uh in the in the americas
02:27:59.439 see it's odd i mentioned mountainville
02:28:01.040 earlier on
02:28:02.399 it's kind of odd that we should find
02:28:05.680 what is essentially the ancient egyptian
02:28:07.600 religion uh manifesting in the symbolism
02:28:10.720 of moundville the ascent to orion that
02:28:13.920 transit to the milky way the journey
02:28:15.439 along the milky way very these are very
02:28:17.439 specific and idiosyncratic
02:28:20.000 ideas and what makes it doubly odd is
02:28:22.479 moundville isn't that old moundville as
02:28:24.960 a site is about a thousand years old
02:28:27.520 ancient egypt had already been gone
02:28:29.840 completely from the world
02:28:32.240 for at least 600 years before mountville
02:28:35.520 was created the end of ancient egypt
02:28:37.680 there's mountainville and
02:28:40.399 what we're looking at in the foreground
02:28:42.479 is mount b and we're looking at mount a
02:28:44.240 in the in in the distance um and a
02:28:47.040 complete circle of mounds
02:28:49.520 what what is odd about it is we find
02:28:52.319 this system of ancient egyptian ideas in
02:28:54.160 mountainville 500 years after ancient
02:28:56.160 egypt has gone from the world the romans
02:28:58.479 the the romans were the end of ancient
02:29:00.399 egypt by 400 a.d ancient egypt is gone
02:29:03.600 manville doesn't even exist then but 600
02:29:06.800 years later it is created and it
02:29:09.359 manifests the entire set of ancient
02:29:11.680 egyptian ideas clearly it did not get
02:29:13.680 that as a result of direct transmission
02:29:15.520 from ancient egypt unless they were time
02:29:17.040 travelers the only way i think it could
02:29:19.120 have got it is as a result of a legacy
02:29:21.520 passed down from a much earlier
02:29:22.960 civilization that had influenced and
02:29:25.280 affected many different parts of the
02:29:27.280 world and the characteristics of that
02:29:29.359 civilization the shamanistic heart of it
02:29:32.319 the use of altered states of
02:29:33.840 consciousness the focus on those are
02:29:36.000 amongst the reasons that i would suggest
02:29:37.920 that america is the place that we should
02:29:39.520 be looking and the big mysteries are in
02:29:42.560 the areas that were so devastated at the
02:29:44.640 end of the last ice age up in the north
02:29:46.560 of north america the channeled scablands
02:29:48.880 in particular and then the mississippi
02:29:51.439 valley the whole story of the
02:29:52.640 mississippi valley yes manville is a
02:29:54.479 thousand years old but then you can go
02:29:56.800 back to poverty point in louisiana which
02:30:00.080 is 2700 years old you can go to watson
02:30:03.520 break in louisiana which is 5500 years
02:30:06.640 old you can go to sites like conley
02:30:08.640 which are 8 000 years old the system
02:30:11.280 keeps on going back and disappearing
02:30:13.840 back into time and i i think the most
02:30:16.319 fruitful new work on exploring the
02:30:18.479 origins of civilization is going to
02:30:20.479 occur counter-intuitively
02:30:22.720 in the americas the very last place on
02:30:24.720 earth that archaeologists have ever
02:30:26.319 thought to look where do what do
02:30:28.240 mainstream uh archaeologists what do
02:30:31.120 they think caused those drill marks in
02:30:33.760 the denisovan bracelets they've not
02:30:35.520 really explained it um the the russian
02:30:37.840 the russian archaeologists who published
02:30:39.840 the report on that uh are them are
02:30:42.080 themselves mystified by it and they
02:30:43.840 realize that it's dynamite it's an it's
02:30:46.000 an explosive discovery
02:30:48.000 it's a it's an out of place technology
02:30:50.479 and so they're trying to explain how
02:30:52.080 come fixed stable drilling which we
02:30:54.880 thought was
02:30:56.399 introduced first in the in the neolithic
02:30:58.560 maybe seven eight thousand years ago how
02:31:00.880 come that is now found in a site that's
02:31:02.880 forty or fifty thousand years old that's
02:31:05.040 how all those bracelets are yeah
02:31:06.560 absolutely those bracelets are forty
02:31:08.240 thousand dollars they may have been
02:31:10.000 older there's there's recent research
02:31:11.760 suggests suggesting that they may go
02:31:13.040 back 65 to 70 000 years
02:31:15.760 um they're extremely ancient and
02:31:17.520 therefore and therefore they're
02:31:18.880 incorporating an out-of-place technology
02:31:21.359 which doesn't fit with the timeline of
02:31:23.280 history that we realize how out of place
02:31:25.040 it was very very out of place very very
02:31:27.200 very odd uh
02:31:28.640 feature that we have here so what this
02:31:30.560 says to me is that we as a species and
02:31:33.359 i've
02:31:34.960 this i guess this is kind of my pet
02:31:36.640 phrase we are a species with amnesia
02:31:38.720 it's my favorite phrase
02:31:40.240 we have forgotten so much more about
02:31:42.800 ourselves than we remember and what the
02:31:45.359 process of history and archaeology
02:31:47.120 should really be about is a process of
02:31:49.359 remembering we shouldn't be imposing our
02:31:52.560 ideas of what we should have been on the
02:31:54.640 past we should allow the past to speak
02:31:57.680 for itself and when it does so it speaks
02:32:01.359 eloquently
02:32:03.439 one of the sites that we visited and
02:32:06.399 explored for
02:32:08.240 america before was serpent mound in ohio
02:32:12.720 i don't know if you've ever been there i
02:32:13.920 know i've heard of it though it is an
02:32:15.439 amazing jamie's from ohio you ever be
02:32:17.600 there yeah jamie and i were talking
02:32:19.200 about it earlier there's second man
02:32:20.880 there's there's an aerial view
02:32:22.840 of oh
02:32:24.640 that is crazy
02:32:27.280 here's the thing you see that's
02:32:28.640 beautiful you see the head end of
02:32:30.479 serpent mound there so santa and i went
02:32:32.640 there at the summer solstice in uh 2017.
02:32:36.479 we were there on june 21st 2017 and my
02:32:40.080 wife santa is a photographer and we
02:32:41.920 acquired a drone for this specific
02:32:44.080 purpose and she flew the drone up 400
02:32:46.720 feet above serpent mound and we sat it
02:32:48.800 up there watching the sunset and what
02:32:51.359 happens on the summer solstice and you
02:32:53.680 can only see it perfectly with a drone
02:32:55.760 there's pictures of it in the in the
02:32:56.960 book here uh what happens on the summer
02:32:59.359 solstice you can see it from ground
02:33:01.439 level but you get up 400 feet you really
02:33:03.600 get it the head of that serpent is
02:33:05.680 pointing directly at a niche in the
02:33:08.080 distant hills through which the sun sets
02:33:11.600 on the summer solstice on the longest
02:33:13.439 day of the year so it's a it's a sky
02:33:15.680 ground alignment
02:33:17.280 perfection that is that is taking place
02:33:19.600 there it's a beautiful it's a beautiful
02:33:21.760 thing to see to watch that sun
02:33:23.359 majestically sinking down into the
02:33:25.760 horizon and see this awesome figure of
02:33:28.160 the serpent gazing directly up at it
02:33:30.000 with its jaws open almost as though it's
02:33:32.000 about to about to swallow the sun and
02:33:35.120 then we remember that there are other
02:33:38.160 sites around the world which are also
02:33:40.399 aligned to key moments of the of the
02:33:42.640 solar year aligned to the winter
02:33:44.800 solstice for example the temple of
02:33:46.319 karnak in upper egypt that kilometer
02:33:48.560 long axis targets exactly the rising
02:33:51.920 point of the sun on the winter solstice
02:33:55.920 one of the interesting things about
02:33:57.120 serpent mound
02:33:58.960 and i urge anybody listening to this go
02:34:01.280 visit serpent mound and especially go
02:34:03.120 there on the summer solstice because
02:34:04.720 that's the moment that's the marriage of
02:34:06.240 heaven and earth that's when sky and
02:34:08.160 ground unite in in majesty at uh at at
02:34:12.479 that place
02:34:13.600 um but
02:34:14.960 one of the the mysteries of serpent
02:34:17.200 mound concerns how old is this mound
02:34:19.439 really how how far back uh does it go
02:34:22.960 and there have been arguments that uh
02:34:25.840 that there is a group of archaeologists
02:34:27.280 who would like it to be just a thousand
02:34:28.960 years old and they attribute it to a
02:34:30.319 culture called the fort ancient culture
02:34:32.560 there's another group of archaeologists
02:34:34.319 in my view who've done much more
02:34:36.399 thorough work who attribute it to the
02:34:38.640 adena culture the thing about which goes
02:34:41.359 back to 2300 years ago or so there's
02:34:43.920 evidence for an earlier construction
02:34:45.760 enterprise it looks like the site has
02:34:47.760 been continuously reconstructed and
02:34:50.080 remodeled as
02:34:51.840 we would do with any sacred site if it
02:34:53.520 begins to wear down you remodel it and
02:34:55.359 then you get later
02:34:57.120 organic material being introduced to the
02:34:58.800 site that may give you the impression
02:35:00.080 that the site is only that old what's
02:35:02.800 intriguing about serpent mound is it
02:35:04.720 stands on a natural ridge
02:35:06.960 and that natural ridge and this is
02:35:09.040 entirely an accident of heaven and earth
02:35:12.319 that natural ridge the head end of it if
02:35:14.399 you like is naturally oriented to the
02:35:16.880 summer solstice sunset
02:35:19.680 somebody
02:35:20.800 a long time ago noticed that natural
02:35:23.280 orientation and they decided to
02:35:25.120 monumentalize it here was a place
02:35:27.680 where earth whispered to sky the earth
02:35:30.800 in her own nature
02:35:32.479 looked directly at the place on the
02:35:34.080 horizon where the sun was setting this
02:35:37.200 was a highly significant place this
02:35:39.200 place mattered so they then created
02:35:41.520 serpent mound on top of it they
02:35:43.439 memorialized it they turned it into a in
02:35:46.880 into a special special place that human
02:35:48.960 beings had had a hand in making to honor
02:35:51.840 the marriage of heaven and earth
02:35:53.760 and what i found researching this book
02:35:56.240 is that serpent mound is not alone in
02:35:58.080 that respect
02:35:59.520 a lot of people are pub puzzled by
02:36:01.920 stonehenge in england
02:36:04.319 stonehenge is built on salisbury plain
02:36:07.280 and there are two kinds of
02:36:09.359 big megaliths at stonehenge one of them
02:36:11.760 are called sarsons
02:36:13.439 and the other are called the blue stones
02:36:15.359 the blue stones we know for sure were
02:36:17.359 brought a long way they were brought
02:36:18.640 from wales to stonehenge a distance of
02:36:20.319 about 150 miles the sarsons
02:36:23.840 are found in abundance
02:36:25.840 on a place called the marlborough downs
02:36:27.840 which is about 20 miles from stonehenge
02:36:30.560 but until very recently it was thought
02:36:32.240 there were no assassins on salisbury
02:36:34.240 plain at all an archaeologist couldn't
02:36:36.399 understand why stonehenge wasn't built
02:36:39.840 on the marlborough downs whether whether
02:36:41.840 big susan stones the 20 to 30 ton
02:36:43.760 megaliths were available locally and
02:36:45.359 didn't have to be brought there
02:36:47.359 very recent research 2018 research has
02:36:50.000 provided the answer that two of those
02:36:51.680 assassins were naturally in position all
02:36:54.319 the time at stonehenge and they are
02:36:56.720 saucin stone 16 and the heel stone and
02:36:59.920 if you stand behind sars and stone 16
02:37:02.319 and look at the heel stone at dawn on
02:37:04.399 the summer solstice you see the sun
02:37:06.399 rising in direct alignment with the view
02:37:08.800 and the heel stone is like the sight on
02:37:11.040 the barrel of a rifle targeting the sun
02:37:13.680 and that was there naturally earth was
02:37:16.319 speaking to sky the ancients saw that
02:37:19.040 they decided this was sacred they went
02:37:21.200 to huge
02:37:22.399 lengths to bring the assassins the rest
02:37:24.319 of the assassins from the marlborough
02:37:25.680 downs to create the big stone circle at
02:37:27.439 stonehenge and then to put the blue
02:37:29.280 stones inside it but initially what they
02:37:31.359 were celebrating was a natural union of
02:37:34.800 heaven and earth and that brings us to
02:37:36.800 the notion of as above so below
02:37:39.680 that we are connected to the cosmos that
02:37:41.520 it is that it is part of our heritage we
02:37:44.000 in modern cities forget the cosmos
02:37:46.000 exists we have all kinds of tech that
02:37:48.319 can look at
02:37:49.840 astronomy astronomy programs we can we
02:37:51.760 can all do that but actually looking at
02:37:53.120 the stars is something that's very
02:37:54.800 difficult for people who live in cities
02:37:56.720 to do we're we're cut off from the
02:37:58.960 cosmos we're cut off from the notion
02:38:00.399 that it is sacred that it matters to the
02:38:02.960 human creature and what what the
02:38:04.479 ancients seem to have done is to realize
02:38:06.720 how vital that connection is and to
02:38:09.040 memorialize it and to celebrate it and
02:38:11.760 to draw our attention to the intimate
02:38:14.960 connection between ground and sky yeah
02:38:17.280 light pollution sort of fuels our
02:38:19.040 infantile existence in a lot of ways
02:38:21.359 right because it doesn't constantly
02:38:22.720 remind us that we're a part of this
02:38:24.240 great thing yeah light light pollution
02:38:27.359 is a is is a huge factor it's very easy
02:38:29.920 to forget that we live in a universe
02:38:31.920 very easy to forget that very easy to to
02:38:34.080 believe that it's just about these
02:38:35.520 cities that we live in and the and the
02:38:37.280 intimate concerns of our of our daily
02:38:39.520 lives but in fact we're part of
02:38:40.880 something much much bigger and
02:38:44.080 my god i mean it's it's a mystery enough
02:38:47.600 to be born a human being at all yes you
02:38:50.880 know
02:38:51.600 just to be alive
02:38:53.280 is is is is an extraordinary mystery yes
02:38:56.479 to have the ability to to love
02:38:59.840 uh to to to feel emotions
02:39:02.640 um to understand beauty to be moved by
02:39:06.560 by a symphony all of all of these things
02:39:09.200 we take for granted but actually they're
02:39:11.680 deeply mysterious we don't really know
02:39:15.120 what we are or or who we are and
02:39:18.560 which is one of the reasons i'm so
02:39:20.240 fascinated by rick strassmann's work you
02:39:23.680 you presented his film dmt the spirit
02:39:26.319 molecule and on my upcoming speaking
02:39:28.720 tour i'm going to be doing an event with
02:39:30.399 rick uh on the 14th or 15th of may in
02:39:34.000 sedona i think it'll be the first time
02:39:35.600 that rick has spoken publicly for quite
02:39:37.760 a while rick has a colleague called
02:39:39.840 andrew gallimore
02:39:41.439 who teaches at the university of okinawa
02:39:44.000 in japan and rick and andrew have
02:39:46.319 together developed a technology
02:39:49.359 for releasing dmt into human volunteers
02:39:52.640 in a very slow drip that will keep them
02:39:54.880 in the dmt state if they wish for hours
02:39:58.160 on end
02:39:59.920 and and the intention the intention is
02:40:03.040 to use this technology to explore and
02:40:06.800 map the dmt realm when do i sign up
02:40:10.319 as soon as possible
02:40:11.680 it's very close imperial college it
02:40:13.359 looks like imperial college london is
02:40:15.680 going to deploy this technology in
02:40:17.920 further research into dmt and that that
02:40:21.040 research is not going to be purely and
02:40:23.439 simply into the therapeutic potential of
02:40:26.319 a psychedelic which is very important
02:40:28.080 research to do it's going to be an
02:40:29.920 investigation into the nature of reality
02:40:32.399 using a psychedelic the mysterious
02:40:34.240 nature of reality and it is odd and you
02:40:36.800 know this from personal experience that
02:40:38.319 when you get plunged into that dmt realm
02:40:41.120 it is so different from the realm of our
02:40:43.920 daily daily world filled with geometry
02:40:46.240 filled with these sprightly
02:40:47.680 intelligences completely internally
02:40:50.560 coherent how can that be you know
02:40:52.880 generated by the brain or are are we
02:40:55.760 dealing with some other level of reality
02:40:57.520 that we haven't encountered yet i think
02:40:59.520 that ancient cultures and in particular
02:41:02.240 my lost civilization were deeply
02:41:05.120 involved in exploring the mysterious
02:41:07.120 nature of reality and and used uh the
02:41:10.000 plant medicines as part of that process
02:41:12.160 when it comes to the serpent mound um
02:41:14.080 where the head points in the summer
02:41:15.520 solstice does that take into account the
02:41:17.280 procession of the equinoxes in terms of
02:41:19.120 the trend the position of the summer
02:41:20.560 solstice sun on the horizon is not
02:41:22.560 affected by the procession however it is
02:41:24.800 affected by another another factor which
02:41:27.439 is a slight nod on the axis of the earth
02:41:30.479 a nod but not a wobble not a wobble
02:41:33.600 a nod um and and it's called mutation
02:41:36.720 and the the axis of the earth nods back
02:41:39.439 and forward over a cycle of about 41 000
02:41:41.920 years and that can that does adjust the
02:41:45.680 position of sunrise on the horizon over
02:41:48.720 a very long period of time and it would
02:41:51.760 in theory if this idea can be taken
02:41:54.319 seriously enough it would in theory be
02:41:56.319 possible to use very precise
02:41:58.240 observations using the latest modern
02:42:00.160 tech not simply being up there in a
02:42:01.840 drone and seeing the general connection
02:42:04.240 between the position of the sun on the
02:42:05.760 horizon and the head of serpent mound it
02:42:07.520 would be possible to refine that and
02:42:10.080 actually say astronomically the precise
02:42:12.640 date on which serpent mound must have
02:42:14.160 been first created to precisely target
02:42:16.319 the rising sun on the equinox wow
02:42:19.600 on that note we just did three hours did
02:42:21.840 we flew by i would i would ask your
02:42:24.720 listeners and viewers while we're
02:42:25.920 talking about ohio don't forget about
02:42:28.800 newark and high bank what are those
02:42:30.960 these are two incredible amazing
02:42:33.680 absolutely stunning gorgeous geometrical
02:42:36.479 sites
02:42:37.840 it's sad but one of them is preserved
02:42:39.600 within a private golf course oh no
02:42:42.720 however it's not so sad because if it
02:42:44.960 hadn't been preserved within a private
02:42:46.560 golf course it would be gone completely
02:42:49.040 more than 90 percent of the native
02:42:50.640 american earthquakes that were
02:42:51.680 documented in the 19th century are gone
02:42:54.080 now they've been plowed under for
02:42:55.600 agriculture that's another part of our
02:42:58.399 missing story there we're looking at
02:43:00.160 newark see that octagon and circle
02:43:02.240 combination that's repeated at another
02:43:04.880 site called high bank which is 60 miles
02:43:06.960 away and the octagon circle goes back to
02:43:08.960 that jamie give me give me a large image
02:43:10.960 of that so you see this uh
02:43:12.800 an overlay or is that what it actually
02:43:14.240 is that's what it actually looks like
02:43:15.520 that's that's that's a graphic based on
02:43:17.520 it well the octagon circle combination
02:43:19.520 in the top left of the image are best
02:43:20.960 preserved the other bits are not so well
02:43:22.960 preserved and the reason the octagon
02:43:24.720 circle are best preserved is because
02:43:26.240 they're in a private golf club
02:43:28.640 otherwise they would have been plowed
02:43:30.240 under the interesting thing is that that
02:43:32.080 octagon circle combination is 60 miles
02:43:34.640 from high bank but there's another
02:43:36.640 octagon circle combination there and it
02:43:38.720 is oriented at precisely 90 degrees to
02:43:40.960 that one that speaks of high science in
02:43:43.520 the mississippi valley a very very very
02:43:45.920 long time ago there's so much to explore
02:43:48.880 and so much to investigate and so much
02:43:50.880 to inquire into an america
02:43:53.120 it's just an incredible land and its
02:43:55.120 mysteries have been hidden from us and
02:43:56.800 i'm hoping
02:43:58.160 with this book that i have managed to
02:44:01.120 pull the veil back a little bit on those
02:44:03.680 mysteries and if we're really coming to
02:44:04.960 the end of our is it really three hours
02:44:06.960 oh my god if we if we're really coming
02:44:09.600 to the end of our three hours can i
02:44:11.040 repeat i would love to see readers of my
02:44:12.880 books at my events i'm doing three
02:44:15.279 events in canada vancouver montreal
02:44:18.720 and toronto and i'm doing something like
02:44:21.120 17 or 18 events in the united states i'm
02:44:23.920 just speaking continuously
02:44:26.000 right the way across the u.s i wish i
02:44:27.520 could visit every state in the u.s but
02:44:29.520 my goodness this is an enormous country
02:44:32.160 every state in the u.s is as big as the
02:44:34.160 entire british isles you know
02:44:36.240 but i'm in visiting as many as i am i'm
02:44:38.160 going to be giving illustrated
02:44:39.520 presentations i'll be signing books
02:44:41.120 afterwards i'll be taking pictures i
02:44:42.800 would like to meet my readers and please
