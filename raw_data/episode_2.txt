00:00:04.440 Rogan Experience Train by day Joe Rogan
00:00:07.600 podcast by night all
00:00:11.440 day all right we're rolling good to see
00:00:14.480 you sir here we
00:00:16.320 go um one of the things I wanted to talk
00:00:18.760 to you about I wanted to play this but
00:00:21.480 we decided we shouldn't play it because
00:00:23.400 uh it could get copyright strike and we
00:00:25.320 don't want to get the episode we don't
00:00:27.960 want anybody to have any sort of a way
00:00:29.480 to get it down sure but it was the
00:00:32.000 episode of you when you're on The View
00:00:34.600 and I think it was 2015 or6 like when
00:00:38.200 you were running for president right and
00:00:41.440 you sat you got introduced as our friend
00:00:44.760 Donald Trump that's right whoopy
00:00:46.399 Goldberg gives you a big hug and a kiss
00:00:48.600 Joy bayar gives you a big hug Barbara
00:00:51.640 Walters gives you a big hug they all
00:00:53.640 loved you they were all talking about
00:00:56.199 how your uh you might be
00:01:00.920 you might be conservative in your
00:01:03.320 financial positions but you're very
00:01:05.239 liberal socially they were they're
00:01:07.200 talking about you in such a favorable
00:01:09.240 light the audience was
00:01:12.040 cheering and then you actually started
00:01:14.960 winning in the polls and then the
00:01:16.799 machine started working towards you yeah
00:01:19.280 but it's there's probably no one in
00:01:22.799 history that I've ever seen that's been
00:01:25.320 attacked the way you've been attacked
00:01:27.479 and the way they've done it so coord at
00:01:30.799 and systematically when you see those
00:01:32.399 same people in the past very favorable
00:01:34.880 to you like Oprah when you were on Oprah
00:01:36.520 Show she was encouraging you last week I
00:01:39.240 did one of our last shows I think maybe
00:01:41.360 Thursday or Friday that was a big deal
00:01:43.240 being on Oprah's show the last one and I
00:01:45.479 was like one of the last shows in that
00:01:47.360 last that final week and I said boy
00:01:50.320 we've come a long way since since that
00:01:53.399 what was it like uh well the concept it
00:01:56.600 was really like two different lives you
00:01:58.280 know I had a a very wonderful life but I
00:02:01.119 I wanted to do this The Apprentice was
00:02:02.920 still going very strong we had 12
00:02:05.159 seasons and uh we had actually uh 14
00:02:09.080 Seasons 12 years over they had a couple
00:02:11.440 of well they canceled the Apprentice
00:02:12.920 when you were running for president
00:02:14.160 correct no they had Arnold SCH a
00:02:16.480 do it I was involved in that and I want
00:02:19.720 I I had enough of it and we did great it
00:02:21.599 was doing great but they wanted me to
00:02:24.120 stay they all came to see me they said
00:02:26.640 we're going to give you a contract they
00:02:27.920 wanted to extend my contract Mark
00:02:29.519 Bernett is a great guy and they wanted
00:02:31.800 to extend the contract Mark said you're
00:02:33.480 crazy don't run don't run no nobody
00:02:36.200 gives up prime time they said you know
00:02:37.680 it's one of those little things which is
00:02:39.720 probably true nobody gives a prime time
00:02:41.959 though for being president for for
00:02:43.840 running well for running against 20 some
00:02:46.640 people you know turned out to be 18 18
00:02:49.319 professional people you know mostly
00:02:50.920 politicians they said who would do this
00:02:53.120 I mean it's a long shot actually the
00:02:54.640 heads of NBC came over the uh Paul tgy
00:02:58.280 all the all the top people came over to
00:03:00.239 see me try and talk me out of it because
00:03:01.720 they wanted to have me extend The
00:03:03.440 Apprentice was doing well so it was 14
00:03:06.480 Seasons it was 12 years we had one two
00:03:09.120 seasons where we had a double which
00:03:11.280 rarely happens it was just a hot show
00:03:13.879 and uh I said you know I want to do this
00:03:16.720 what happened is uh previously like
00:03:19.680 three years four years before that they
00:03:21.879 did a poll they had Mitt Romney and
00:03:23.519 somehow they put me in a poll and I blew
00:03:26.280 everybody away I blew him away which
00:03:28.439 isn't that hard frankly but I blew
00:03:30.519 everybody away and I said that's
00:03:31.959 interesting because I never really gave
00:03:33.920 it that much real thought I thought
00:03:35.400 about it but never real thought but I
00:03:36.760 saw these polls were very good and so I
00:03:39.400 was thinking about doing it then but I
00:03:40.959 had a contract with the Apprentice plus
00:03:42.640 I was building two big buildings at the
00:03:44.360 time and I wanted to make sure they got
00:03:45.879 finished up properly and it was one of
00:03:47.439 those things the kids were just sort of
00:03:49.480 getting involved they're very capable
00:03:51.319 kids but they were getting involved
00:03:52.680 early on so I did that I got them done I
00:03:55.720 had some very good successes and I came
00:03:58.280 on and then I thought about it for the
00:04:00.640 next one after the Romney disaster and I
00:04:04.319 ran and I won against Hillary it was
00:04:07.439 quite an experience but it was a
00:04:09.120 different life because you're right the
00:04:11.120 view I was on The View many many times
00:04:13.959 and uh they loved me just the way people
00:04:16.639 would talk I mean even if people had
00:04:17.880 criticisms about you people that didn't
00:04:19.720 like you there was always feuds and
00:04:21.160 stuff like that but the reality was the
00:04:24.000 thing turned on you when they found out
00:04:26.160 that you were going to be president it
00:04:27.199 was very coordinated and some people are
00:04:30.120 catching on to that now there's a lot of
00:04:32.440 people that were longtime Democrats like
00:04:34.360 Elon and Bill Amman and all these
00:04:37.039 different very intelligent people and
00:04:38.680 they support me now Bill supports me
00:04:40.680 he's been very supportive too what this
00:04:42.520 is what I wanted to ask you what was it
00:04:45.080 like when you actually got in CU nobody
00:04:47.800 really can prepare you for that when
00:04:49.199 you're running for president you don't
00:04:50.840 really know what it's going to be like
00:04:52.440 when you actually get into office what
00:04:54.720 was the what did you think it was going
00:04:56.320 to be like in office or when I decided
00:04:58.120 to run so no when you got in when I was
00:05:00.320 in so when I was in and one and was in
00:05:03.320 the White House essentially well first
00:05:06.000 of all it was very surreal oh you know
00:05:08.720 it's very interesting when I got shot it
00:05:10.479 wasn't surreal that should have been
00:05:12.120 surreal when I was laying on the ground
00:05:13.639 I knew exactly what was going on I knew
00:05:15.840 exactly where I was hit they were saying
00:05:18.039 you were hit all over the place because
00:05:20.080 there was so much blood from the ear you
00:05:22.120 would know that better than anyone when
00:05:23.680 they get the ear torn up ear bleed a lot
00:05:25.680 bleed anyway so and and I was thinking
00:05:29.080 the other day
00:05:30.400 when when that happened I really knew
00:05:32.759 where I was I knew exactly what happened
00:05:35.120 I said I wasn't hit anywhere else with
00:05:37.360 the with the presidency it was a very
00:05:40.759 surreal experience okay and what's day
00:05:43.120 one like you win you get inaugurated
00:05:46.600 holy I'm the president yeah that's
00:05:48.240 what happened so I'm driving down
00:05:49.919 Pennsylvania Avenue I just built a
00:05:51.840 building on pen you know the hotel the
00:05:53.759 old post office it was we called it
00:05:55.639 Trump
00:05:56.680 National uh hotel and we sold it to the
00:06:00.319 Waldorf Historia and it was a wonderful
00:06:03.000 thing but I'm driving down I'm passing
00:06:04.680 the hotel you've never seen so many
00:06:07.280 motorcycles police
00:06:09.680 military you know it was a major thing I
00:06:12.280 got off really the first time I used Air
00:06:15.120 Force One landed and we're coming down
00:06:18.720 and they were it was very be I mean it
00:06:21.160 was incredible and we're going down
00:06:23.160 Pennsylvania Avenue in the opposite
00:06:24.960 direction you know normally you're used
00:06:26.479 to going one way and all of a sudden
00:06:28.039 you're going the other way the street
00:06:30.039 was loaded up and I wanted to go out and
00:06:33.680 I wanted to wave to everybody but that
00:06:35.919 wasn't smart you know that KS a little
00:06:38.759 bit dangerous right I mean when you
00:06:40.840 watch like Kennedy and some others right
00:06:43.960 but I really felt I don't know the love
00:06:45.880 was so crazy and so I did get out of the
00:06:49.199 car for a brief you know just for a very
00:06:50.960 short walk I thought it was very
00:06:52.360 important to do and milania got out with
00:06:54.360 her beautiful dress on that became sort
00:06:56.919 of a staple it was uh people loved it
00:06:59.240 and
00:07:00.280 Baron and we're walking down the street
00:07:03.840 but where it really got amazing we get
00:07:06.720 to the White House and now it's a little
00:07:09.039 bit uh little bit before dark
00:07:11.800 beautiful and we went up to the
00:07:14.919 president's quarters they call them the
00:07:16.720 presidential quarters and I'm standing
00:07:20.039 in this beautiful hallway I you know
00:07:22.960 it's funny nobody ever talks about the
00:07:24.440 White House as being beautiful inside
00:07:26.560 you know you think it's going to be
00:07:27.680 everything's going to be all metal doors
00:07:29.199 and stuff it's not it's so beautiful I
00:07:32.520 made my money largely on luxury the
00:07:35.720 hallway is like 25 ft wide the ceiling
00:07:38.720 Heights are you every it's so beautiful
00:07:41.879 but I was standing there and I said to
00:07:44.360 the guys I want to see the Lincoln
00:07:45.759 bedroom I had never seen the Lincoln
00:07:47.319 bedroom I'd heard about the Lincoln
00:07:49.479 bedroom and I was standing with my wife
00:07:53.039 I said Do you believe it this is the
00:07:54.759 Lincoln bedroom I mean it was like it
00:07:59.560 was it was amazing because it's look if
00:08:03.599 you love the country but here you are
00:08:05.680 the Lincoln bedroom and the bed you know
00:08:08.199 he was very tall he was 6'6 which then
00:08:10.360 would be like like Baron right would be
00:08:13.800 like Baron Trump he's 69 but 6'6 he was
00:08:18.000 very tall then on top of that he wore
00:08:19.919 there it is he wore that yeah there it
00:08:21.360 is it's a long bed elongated bed and
00:08:24.319 because very you know people were
00:08:26.319 shorter than you see some of the chairs
00:08:28.520 are very very low to the ground actually
00:08:31.280 but he had the long bed and they had uh
00:08:35.080 you had the Gettysburg Address right on
00:08:37.120 that right under that you can't see it
00:08:39.000 here but right there the original
00:08:40.799 version of the Gettysburg address and
00:08:43.440 this is the original and I'm looking and
00:08:45.959 I just looked around I said Do you
00:08:48.000 believe this because I was never a pol
00:08:51.240 first of even if you were a politician
00:08:52.920 but I was never a politician it just I
00:08:54.880 sort of just started right and all of a
00:08:57.080 sudden I'm standing in the White House
00:08:58.800 and it was uh very very surreal that
00:09:01.760 room was so beautiful to me much more
00:09:03.720 beautiful than it actually is you know
00:09:05.360 to me when I looked at the bed and the
00:09:07.720 bed you could see was a little bit
00:09:08.920 longer had to be a little bit longer uh
00:09:11.440 he lost his son and they suffered the
00:09:14.160 two of them suffered from melancolia
00:09:16.519 they didn't call it depression they
00:09:18.680 called it melancolia and they suffered
00:09:21.440 from it he was a very depressed guy and
00:09:24.519 she was a very depressed woman more so
00:09:27.480 than him and on top of that they lost
00:09:29.839 their son whose name was Tad Tad and uh
00:09:35.079 it was uh just seeing it in the little
00:09:38.160 picture a little tiny picture I mean you
00:09:40.000 can't see the details there little tiny
00:09:42.079 everything the W was a little tiny
00:09:44.200 picture of Tad who he lost and it was
00:09:49.040 devastating and he was you know he was a
00:09:52.959 look he was in a war he was he and he
00:09:55.040 was having a hard time because he
00:09:56.360 couldn't beat Robert E Lee Robert E Lee
00:09:58.160 won like 13 battles in a row and he was
00:10:01.320 getting like a phobia like a fighter you
00:10:03.440 know a lot about the fight stuff but
00:10:06.880 like I went to a UFC fight and it was a
00:10:11.040 champion who was 14- one about a year
00:10:14.000 ago you would know the names 14 and one
00:10:17.000 and the only guy he lost to was this one
00:10:18.959 guy but the guy that he was fighting was
00:10:21.880 like almost just an average fighter lost
00:10:24.880 numerous times but he beat this one guy
00:10:27.560 so I said okay I really don't know who
00:10:29.000 you're talking abouty I I will figure it
00:10:31.040 out okay but about a year ago but the
00:10:33.399 point is that he lost he wasn't nearly
00:10:35.480 the fighter as the but the one who was
00:10:38.720 not nearly the fighter had beaten he's
00:10:40.240 the only guy that beat the the champ
00:10:42.519 like five years before and I said I'll
00:10:45.120 take the guy that won the other fight
00:10:47.240 and that's what happened he beat him a
00:10:48.519 second time sometimes psychological
00:10:50.959 advantage is this crazy thing uh Lincoln
00:10:54.360 had a I don't know I've never read this
00:10:56.680 I heard it from people in the way house
00:11:00.079 who really understand what was going on
00:11:02.240 with with the whole life of the White
00:11:04.360 House but Lincoln had uh The Yips about
00:11:08.079 in a way as the golfers would say he had
00:11:10.600 a phobia about Robert El Lee said I
00:11:12.959 can't beat Robert because Robert E Lee
00:11:15.279 won many battles in a row he was just
00:11:17.079 beating the hell out of you know they
00:11:18.320 tried to get Robert Elite to be on the
00:11:20.000 north but he said no I have to be with
00:11:22.480 my state you know the state was his
00:11:24.920 whole thing and and he went to the South
00:11:27.839 and he was uh I've had generals tell me
00:11:30.120 we have some great generals the real
00:11:31.480 generals not the ones you see on
00:11:32.760 television the ones that beat Isis with
00:11:35.200 me we defeated Isis and record time it
00:11:37.959 was supposed to take years and we did it
00:11:40.320 in a matter of weeks he's are great
00:11:42.720 generals he's a tough guys he's a not
00:11:44.240 woke guys but their favorite General in
00:11:48.040 terms of Genius was Robert El Le
00:11:51.040 strategy strategy strategically he took
00:11:53.880 a war that should have been over in a
00:11:56.040 few days and it was you know years of
00:11:59.040 head hell a vicious war and um so here I
00:12:04.639 am standing there and again I had never
00:12:08.079 really done this before you know I ran I
00:12:09.839 ran a number of months before I won I
00:12:13.440 probably uh I guess if you figured Max
00:12:16.560 it out it would be a year something like
00:12:19.560 that so I had never run for office and I
00:12:22.959 did well I mean I I went into debates we
00:12:25.120 had 18 people including me and then
00:12:27.760 slowly but surely they started to
00:12:29.519 disappear we had debates good debates
00:12:32.120 everyone's aware of all this stuff but
00:12:33.240 what I want to get to is like what was
00:12:34.639 the experience once you got inside like
00:12:37.560 what did you think it was going to be
00:12:38.959 like in terms of like your ability to
00:12:40.600 govern like this is your first
00:12:42.399 experience governing anything you never
00:12:44.160 been a govern you never been a mayor
00:12:46.959 private private stuff business but now
00:12:49.079 all of a sudden you're inside the White
00:12:50.680 House the biggest thing was just that
00:12:52.240 first moment of being in this hallowed
00:12:55.000 it was really a hallowed place to me it
00:12:57.240 was it was beyond to me that's that was
00:12:59.720 the experience it was a surreal
00:13:01.320 experience and then with time that wears
00:13:05.320 off with time it becomes you know your
00:13:07.399 place where you stay and right uh I was
00:13:10.480 doing a lot of I was I had two things
00:13:13.519 that I really focused on governing the
00:13:15.839 country and uh
00:13:18.240 survival because from the moment I won
00:13:22.120 before I got to office all of a sudden
00:13:24.440 it I mean they came down I mean nobody
00:13:27.320 has ever been treated that way
00:13:30.000 and and you see that I mean you see
00:13:31.680 we're in the Washington Post very early
00:13:33.320 on they said well now the impeachment
00:13:35.079 stuff starts and it did I mean it
00:13:36.480 literally started from the beginning so
00:13:38.639 I had survival and run the nation I had
00:13:40.760 a a combination most people don't have
00:13:42.560 the survival they get in uh what did you
00:13:46.279 expect though in terms of like once you
00:13:48.399 got inside you had to appoint all these
00:13:50.720 people like how many appointments did
00:13:52.079 you have to make you have you actually
00:13:54.440 10,000 uh appointments now they're
00:13:57.079 different you know you have big ones and
00:13:58.360 then they appoint right 100 people and
00:14:00.800 200 people and but the president really
00:14:03.160 is is involved with approximately 10,000
00:14:06.240 appointments so you'll appoint a
00:14:08.079 secretary of state and he will he or she
00:14:10.120 will appoint a lot of people so it's a
00:14:11.959 lot but in terms of major ones you
00:14:14.040 probably have like a h 100 but they're
00:14:15.880 big ones uh treasury State uh military
00:14:21.360 and how did you know who to a point well
00:14:24.279 I I didn't I had no experience you have
00:14:26.440 to understand I was there 17 times in
00:14:29.240 Washington and I never stayed over
00:14:31.399 according to the Press which I think is
00:14:32.920 probably right over the years I was only
00:14:35.360 there 17 times I never stayed over so
00:14:38.079 now I'm sitting there I'm saying this
00:14:41.040 place is gorgeous but you know I don't
00:14:42.880 know anybody it's like you you you know
00:14:44.959 you go to certain areas and other areas
00:14:47.399 they may be great Washington was great
00:14:49.279 Washington's not so great right now
00:14:51.199 they're got to we got to fix it we got
00:14:52.480 to make it better very dangerous place
00:14:54.759 very badly maintained place we're going
00:14:57.000 to make it great we're going to make it
00:14:58.839 better better we're going to bring it
00:14:59.880 back but I wasn't a Washington guy I was
00:15:02.399 a New York guy I was a New York Builder
00:15:04.959 and I I built buildings in New York and
00:15:06.800 I knew that whole world but I didn't
00:15:08.440 know the Washington world too well and
00:15:10.759 all of a sudden you're supposed to be
00:15:12.000 appointing top people so what did you
00:15:14.320 think it was going to be like versus
00:15:16.079 like did you have any ideas of what it
00:15:17.839 was going to be like and what was
00:15:19.000 different well I was always involved in
00:15:21.120 politics but usually from the standpoint
00:15:22.839 of of a donor I was a donor you know I
00:15:24.839 was a big donor I gave money to
00:15:26.680 politicians I enjoyed Poli rats right a
00:15:30.000 de both really pretty much both I have
00:15:32.440 actually pictures of Ronald Reagan and
00:15:34.319 me when I was very young you were a
00:15:35.519 Democrat until like what year uh I was a
00:15:38.959 Democrat um I could get you the exact
00:15:42.560 but the the early 90s the early 90s I I
00:15:46.040 switched over eventually actually uh
00:15:48.600 they had a reform party I was thinking
00:15:50.199 about doing that for a little while but
00:15:51.720 then fortunately I didn't because it's
00:15:53.759 very hard you know it's a two-party
00:15:55.120 system and anytime you hear third party
00:15:57.759 I know you like RF K junr and so do I
00:16:00.079 he's a fantastic gu I do but I thought
00:16:01.880 that being an independent was nonsense
00:16:03.800 it doesn't work it doesn't work because
00:16:05.560 even if you do great you're not going to
00:16:07.639 get Congress in other words you need now
00:16:10.000 to say okay now I'll get half of
00:16:11.880 Congress never going to vote for you so
00:16:13.920 even if you got there which is very hard
00:16:16.880 and but and I know how you feel about
00:16:19.240 Bobby and I feel the same way and he's
00:16:21.000 now with us but it it doesn't it's real
00:16:23.839 it's pure and simple it's a two-party
00:16:25.440 system right and uh somebody I won't
00:16:28.279 mention his name but somebody spent $250
00:16:30.560 million trying to get the nomination as
00:16:32.959 a Reform Party candidate or whatever and
00:16:35.160 they got just nowhere you get eaten you
00:16:37.880 just get eaten the system eats you alive
00:16:40.040 right so uh so it was it was really
00:16:44.560 somebody that Not only was new to
00:16:46.399 Washington but was new to
00:16:48.120 politics so in in the office of the
00:16:54.000 presidency over the years all those
00:16:56.920 presidents you've had 92 2% were
00:17:00.560 politicians and 8% were Generals General
00:17:03.519 Eisenhower General Washington right
00:17:05.599 General George Washington he had
00:17:06.919 generals so it's 8% no Admirals 8%
00:17:10.599 generals and 92% politicians you know
00:17:13.720 they're politicians and they go on so
00:17:15.679 they never had a business guy or they
00:17:17.439 never had a guy that wasn't elected to
00:17:19.039 an office um they were all like Ronald
00:17:21.919 Reagan was really he was a movie actor
00:17:23.720 and then but he became the governor of
00:17:25.319 California for I think two terms and
00:17:27.559 then he ran
00:17:29.440 uh so you'd never had a thing like this
00:17:31.799 but I you know in terms of me and some
00:17:34.919 sometimes i' use it as an excuse and I
00:17:37.679 don't like having excuses actually but
00:17:39.480 I'd use it as an excuse I had to rely on
00:17:42.400 people that I respected or liked but
00:17:45.799 that I didn't know that well because I
00:17:47.200 didn't know them that well some of those
00:17:49.400 people I campaigned against because you
00:17:51.039 know when you have 18 people we had
00:17:52.360 mostly politicians running in the
00:17:54.960 election you know running in the
00:17:56.280 primaries and they got knocked out one
00:17:58.440 by one but I got to like some of them
00:18:00.360 some of them I didn't like at all and I
00:18:02.440 don't like them now and I'd rely on them
00:18:05.240 and I'd rely on other people so all of a
00:18:07.120 sudden people would come in I'd like to
00:18:08.919 recommend so and so to be Secretary of
00:18:11.120 State and I'd have three four people
00:18:13.400 recomend one thing I can tell you
00:18:15.440 everybody wants the position of course
00:18:17.720 no no but sometimes I'll hear a lot of
00:18:20.080 people don't want to work with Trump
00:18:21.480 because Trump is tough to work with Etc
00:18:23.480 let me tell you everybody wants to be
00:18:26.080 any one of these positions they die for
00:18:28.200 it of course now they don't want to be
00:18:29.520 known I mean there's a particular guy in
00:18:33.159 uh New York primarily very big very big
00:18:37.159 very successful very uh very strong very
00:18:40.720 political although he's not a politician
00:18:43.280 he'd give anything to be Secretary of
00:18:45.520 State but if they ask him no I don't
00:18:47.520 think I would do it but in the
00:18:49.600 meantime begging for it okay begging
00:18:52.240 they all I believe everybody look
00:18:53.919 everybody wants it but my by the way no
00:18:56.640 matter what you do every but it's very
00:18:59.080 dangerous to pick somebody outside of a
00:19:00.960 politician because a politician's been
00:19:02.799 basically vetted for years right you
00:19:04.960 pick a business guy and they've never
00:19:07.360 been vetted at all and they're you know
00:19:09.000 the head of a big company or something
00:19:10.600 but they've never been vetted you know
00:19:12.600 nothing about his personal life you know
00:19:14.360 nothing about where he's been when you
00:19:16.320 put him in it's a little bit dangerous
00:19:18.039 because all of a sudden they get checked
00:19:20.240 up and you hear things that you're
00:19:21.559 saying wow this is not going to work out
00:19:23.440 too well so it's very dangerous picking
00:19:26.039 picking people that are outside of
00:19:28.240 politics is somewhat dangerous so you're
00:19:30.720 kind of stuck in a position we have to
00:19:32.400 pick established people then the problem
00:19:34.080 with established people is established
00:19:35.799 people are already indoctrinated into
00:19:37.640 the system and they're stiffs in many
00:19:39.440 cases stiffs they're survivors I find
00:19:43.120 that you know what do you mean by stiffs
00:19:45.039 when you say stiffs stiff they don't
00:19:46.520 they don't have nothing they have
00:19:48.159 nothing
00:19:49.200 or they're smart and survival one one
00:19:52.240 little thing so there was a congressman
00:19:53.720 years before I ran and I was very close
00:19:56.520 to him and I needed a license on
00:19:59.000 something and he was very important in
00:20:00.679 getting the license but it was a little
00:20:02.200 bit controversial the license this
00:20:04.880 particular thing that was being licensed
00:20:07.120 but I was close to this guy and helped
00:20:09.600 him and everything else and I went to
00:20:11.159 him I said I'd like to have you help and
00:20:13.960 he said uh let me take a look at it I
00:20:17.039 said oh that's not too good uh but I
00:20:20.039 really hope you're going to help and
00:20:21.159 anyway he tapped me along for a long
00:20:22.760 period of time and ultimately didn't do
00:20:24.400 it and I said you are a stiff you could
00:20:26.720 have done this thing so easy Etc but it
00:20:28.880 was controversial he was in Congress for
00:20:31.440 many years like 28 years and you know
00:20:33.880 there's a reason when somebody's there
00:20:35.240 for 28 years you got to be S of smart
00:20:37.679 you know you have all scals and I
00:20:40.080 realized he was a Survivor and so they
00:20:42.320 never do anything controversial they
00:20:44.720 never take any chances or speak their
00:20:46.240 opinion that's outside of the yeah and
00:20:49.240 yet I don't disrespect him for it I
00:20:51.280 actually respected the guy more than a
00:20:52.799 in a certain way I said survive you know
00:20:54.760 what he's been there like for 28 years
00:20:58.080 and he made it through a lot of people
00:20:59.919 don't make it through it's a good way
00:21:01.159 for non-exceptional people to survive
00:21:03.240 well it is I mean it certainly is so
00:21:05.880 you're you're in there you have 10,000
00:21:08.039 appointments you have to make like so
00:21:10.200 you're getting advice from people and it
00:21:12.279 at one point in time did you have a
00:21:13.840 moment in time where you realize like
00:21:16.919 these are bad choices like some of these
00:21:18.640 people I shouldn't have had in there oh
00:21:20.240 yeah I think so the one question that
00:21:22.960 you'll ask me that I think you'll ask me
00:21:25.000 that see people seem to ask and I always
00:21:27.440 come up with the same answer
00:21:29.520 uh if I I the one mistake cuz I did I
00:21:32.440 had a lot of success great economy great
00:21:34.640 everything everything was great we the
00:21:37.159 military we rebuilt it biggest tax cuts
00:21:39.919 in history all this stuff we did we had
00:21:42.000 a great presidency uh three Supreme
00:21:44.880 Court Justices most people get none you
00:21:46.799 know you pick them young this way
00:21:49.080 they're there for 50 years right so you
00:21:51.679 know even if a president is there for
00:21:53.279 eight years often times they never have
00:21:55.240 a chance I had three it was sort of the
00:21:57.120 luck of the draw but
00:21:59.120 uh I I will say that it always comes
00:22:01.880 back to the same
00:22:03.279 answer the biggest mistake I made was I
00:22:05.799 picked some people I picked some great
00:22:07.400 people you know but you don't think
00:22:09.720 about that I picked some people that I
00:22:12.720 shouldn't have picked I picked a few
00:22:14.679 people that I shouldn't have picked and
00:22:18.080 neocons yeah neocons or bad people or
00:22:20.960 disloyal people or people that were just
00:22:24.000 people that were into the got bad advice
00:22:26.440 yeah I mean look I mean you reading
00:22:27.919 about them a little little bit today a
00:22:30.080 guy like Kelly who is a bully a bully
00:22:32.200 but a weak a weak person you know you
00:22:34.000 know more about bullies than anybody
00:22:35.559 probably around cuz you deal in a a
00:22:37.520 certain sport where the bullies are
00:22:39.480 exposed very quickly yeah but you know
00:22:42.520 uh he's bad uh Bolton was an idiot but
00:22:45.400 he was great for me because I'd go in
00:22:47.640 with a guy like a John Bolton you know
00:22:49.760 John Bolton a friend of mine called
00:22:51.640 called me up I was picking Bolton and
00:22:53.279 he's a very smart guy his name is Phil
00:22:55.279 Ruff and he's a very rich guy from Las
00:22:57.360 Vegas one of the he a great card player
00:23:00.240 he doesn't play cards but he's a great
00:23:01.679 play you know he's just a natural got
00:23:04.240 poker sense right you know the good old
00:23:06.039 poker sense and Phil Ruffin is is a very
00:23:09.919 very wise kind of a guy and very one of
00:23:13.159 the richest people around and has had
00:23:16.320 great success and understands people so
00:23:19.240 it was in that I was picking Bolton or I
00:23:21.880 picked Bolton he called up he said don't
00:23:23.559 pick him well he's a bad guy I've now he
00:23:26.640 wasn't in politics at all he in various
00:23:29.760 businesses he said he's a bad guy he's
00:23:33.279 just it always works out bad with that
00:23:36.320 guy I said oh man I wish you told me
00:23:38.960 this two weeks ago I already hired him
00:23:40.360 you know he's here and and he was right
00:23:43.600 but but he was good in a certain way
00:23:46.600 he's a nut job and every time I had to
00:23:49.520 deal with the country when they saw this
00:23:53.400 wack job standing behind me they said oh
00:23:56.279 man Trump's going to go to war with him
00:23:58.559 this he was with Bush when they went
00:24:00.039 stupidly into the Middle East they
00:24:01.919 should have never done it I used to say
00:24:03.360 it as a civilian so I always got more
00:24:06.440 publicity than other people and I didn't
00:24:08.679 it wasn't like I was trying in fact I
00:24:11.960 don't know exactly why maybe you can
00:24:13.640 tell me when I could definitely tell you
00:24:15.480 he said a lot of wild
00:24:17.919 maybe maybe he said a lot of wild
00:24:20.480 and then CNN in their all their
00:24:22.840 brilliance by highlighting your wild
00:24:24.720  made you much more popular yeah and
00:24:27.360 they boosted you in the PO cuz people
00:24:28.760 were tired of someone talking in this
00:24:32.840  pre-prepared politician lingo
00:24:36.200 and even if they didn't agree with you
00:24:37.760 they at least knew whoever that guy is
00:24:40.200 that's him that's really him when you
00:24:42.240 see certain people talk certain people
00:24:44.039 in the public eye you don't know who
00:24:46.240 they are you have no idea who they are
00:24:48.039 it's very difficult to know you see them
00:24:50.000 in conversations they have these
00:24:51.760 pre-planned answers they say everything
00:24:53.880 it's very rehearsed you never get to the
00:24:56.000 meat of it what the one of the beautiful
00:24:58.679 things about you is that you free ball
00:25:00.960 like you get out and you do these huge
00:25:03.080 events and you're just talking and
00:25:04.880 you're making we we've highlighted you
00:25:06.600 on the show many times where when you
00:25:08.039 did this Biden impression where he's
00:25:09.320 walking around he doesn't know what he's
00:25:10.240 doing it's funny it's it's standup it's
00:25:12.080 funny stuff but it's like you and you
00:25:15.360 were making fun of Elon one time you
00:25:16.919 doing an Elon impression it's great you
00:25:19.120 you have like comedic instincts like
00:25:21.080 when you said to Hillary you'd be in
00:25:22.600 jail like that's great timing yeah but
00:25:25.360 it's like that kind of stuff was unheard
00:25:27.960 of as a politician like no one had done
00:25:30.679 that and I think you know what's funny
00:25:32.919 you need at least the attitude of a
00:25:35.919 comedian when you're doing this business
00:25:38.600 this is a very dangerous business first
00:25:40.159 of so it's a very tough business when
00:25:41.960 it's the most dangerous business the
00:25:43.360 most well for for a job yes I mean other
00:25:45.840 than going to war and being a
00:25:47.399 firefighter or being a cop it's the most
00:25:50.039 dangerous business the most dangerous
00:25:51.720 being president is the most dangerous
00:25:53.480 especially you I mean you haven't even
00:25:56.120 got to the election there's been two
00:25:57.720 assassinations attempts and they've
00:26:00.159 brushed those out of the news like it
00:26:01.760 was nothing yeah they'd rather not talk
00:26:03.279 about them imagine if there was
00:26:04.919 assassination attempts on Biden how hard
00:26:07.159 people would be attacking the right how
00:26:09.240 they would be trying to get guns taken
00:26:11.360 away from people they would try to ramp
00:26:13.159 up gun laws they would try to figure out
00:26:15.120 some way to blame you if there was a tax
00:26:17.279 on if Biden got shot in the ear we would
00:26:19.360 have never heard the end of it but I
00:26:21.480 think he's in good shape because it's
00:26:23.000 only consequential presidents if you
00:26:25.320 take a look at what's happened look I'm
00:26:28.520 for having countries pay us billions and
00:26:31.399 billions and trillions even dollars I
00:26:33.360 took in hundreds of billions of dollars
00:26:35.120 from China nobody took in 10 cents not
00:26:37.159 one other president I do things that
00:26:39.640 make it I mean that don't necessarily
00:26:42.760 make me so popular I just do what's
00:26:44.600 right and when you do that you know
00:26:46.440 you're more look at look at Iran Iran we
00:26:48.679 would have never had the attack on
00:26:50.120 Israel at all Iran was broke I told
00:26:53.080 China if you buy you can't do business
00:26:55.120 in the United States under any cir I was
00:26:57.360 going to we going to go cold turkey with
00:26:59.520 China some people think that would have
00:27:01.120 been a good idea anyway but if you buy
00:27:03.520 any oil one barrel of oil from them
00:27:05.480 you're not doing business I said that to
00:27:07.039 many countries Iran was broke they had
00:27:09.559 no money for Hezbollah they had no money
00:27:11.799 for Hamas they had no but I make myself
00:27:15.760 you know I mean I understand what I'm
00:27:17.320 doing you make yourself a Target and
00:27:20.919 it's a very dangerous business but if
00:27:23.399 you just look it
00:27:24.760 statistically so I I said I saw thing I
00:27:27.760 don't know if it's right but 1/10th of
00:27:29.360 1% for a race car driver yeah it's
00:27:31.159 pretty dangerous business right yeah uh
00:27:33.720 one1 of 1% for a bull rider I I tell you
00:27:37.159 to me talk these guys that ride the
00:27:39.399 Bulls is worse than UFC is worse these
00:27:41.760 guys you see these big monster bulls and
00:27:44.240 you see it in slow motion where the the
00:27:46.159 foot is like you know an inch away from
00:27:49.000 the head if it hits him the guy's gun
00:27:50.600 but they die you know they die so one/
00:27:52.399 tenth of 1% die what you're saying yeah
00:27:54.480 one tenth of 1% die right and they
00:27:56.519 certainly get hurt badly really mean
00:27:58.360 they can't walk after a certain period
00:27:59.799 of time but but with the president if
00:28:03.200 you look at the amount of assassination
00:28:06.039 and attempts too and attempts no it's a
00:28:08.440 very dangerous position I never thought
00:28:10.159 of that by the way when I did it I you
00:28:11.919 know you don't you don't tend to I did
00:28:13.679 you just assume because people loved you
00:28:15.000 on The Apprentice they were going to
00:28:16.000 love you as a president think it would
00:28:17.240 be so easy you know it's probably would
00:28:19.640 have been if the media didn't attack you
00:28:22.200 the way they did if they didn't conflate
00:28:24.039 you with Hitler I mean even today like K
00:28:27.519 was talking about you and Hitler you're
00:28:29.200 they're going to take what you said
00:28:30.080 about Robert E Lee oh Donald Trump
00:28:32.159 Wishes the South one that's right he
00:28:34.360 loves Robert they love to take things
00:28:36.200 out of context and distort things but
00:28:38.720 well they they don't even have to take
00:28:40.000 them out they make them up entirely okay
00:28:41.919 they but you know it's interesting when
00:28:43.679 you mentioned the uh the I was very
00:28:46.440 popular and and all those people love me
00:28:49.320 I mean this uh some of these these women
00:28:52.559 they're so they're so stupid and joy she
00:28:57.640 would every time she'd see me like I'd
00:28:59.600 be in the theater or something and she
00:29:02.000 you have to be on the show again come on
00:29:03.399 come on let's go we have to she loved
00:29:04.679 you she Lov me that episode where people
00:29:07.600 should watch that episode just to see
00:29:09.320 what we're talking about like I said we
00:29:10.640 don't want to get a copyright strike so
00:29:11.880 we're not going to put it up but if you
00:29:13.519 watch the episode it's bananas it's like
00:29:15.799 an alternative universe and it's only
00:29:18.440 who n years ago whoopy loved loved you
00:29:21.240 gives you a hug and a kiss and how about
00:29:22.799 that other one the new one on there the
00:29:24.600 uh the one from my Administration she
00:29:27.200 writes me a letter the greatest
00:29:28.799 president she leaves you know she worked
00:29:31.039 as like an assistant press secretary I
00:29:33.519 hardly knew her but she leaves and she
00:29:35.679 writes me this gorgeous letter what's
00:29:38.000 her name she was uh I don't even know
00:29:40.880 you know she anyway she was in the
00:29:42.440 administration she's on now currently
00:29:44.519 sits on the far right hand side whatever
00:29:46.360 the hell her name is and and she writes
00:29:49.039 a letter the most beautiful letter she's
00:29:51.200 quoted in the paper he's a consequential
00:29:53.640 he was the greatest president blah blah
00:29:55.320 blah then all of a sudden she goes to
00:29:57.399 view and she said hitting the hell out
00:29:58.480 of me because they won't hire unless
00:30:00.799 I've had many people go on CNN and they
00:30:02.760 call said I don't know what to do what
00:30:04.880 they want to pay me a lot but I have to
00:30:06.399 be negative and knew I said be negative
00:30:08.080 that's okay there are guys on like CNN
00:30:11.000 they won't hire them Shawn Duffy is a
00:30:14.279 you know congressman and he retired he
00:30:16.440 got a good job with CNN but he was only
00:30:18.600 positive about Trump so they kept him
00:30:21.679 but they would never put him on I mean I
00:30:24.240 respect what he did he could have gone
00:30:25.600 you know negative I tell people go
00:30:28.039 negative you know let my friends make
00:30:29.559 the money well it's so crooked the Press
00:30:31.720 is so crooked CR it's crooked but it's
00:30:33.440 also they're diminishing themselves
00:30:36.000 they're they they are they're killing
00:30:37.760 all their credibility and it's opening
00:30:39.600 up the credibility to New Media it's
00:30:41.320 opening up the credibility to
00:30:42.360 Independent Media all these the worst
00:30:43.840 I've ever seen though and I've seen the
00:30:46.080 worst I mean I've been a part of it I've
00:30:48.159 been I've seen the worst kamla goes on
00:30:50.960 60 Minutes gave an answer that a child
00:30:54.600 wouldn't give it was so bad in 60
00:30:57.600 minutes
00:30:58.519 took the answer out they took the whole
00:31:01.120 and they put another answer in they
00:31:03.039 edited it deceptively which didn't make
00:31:04.799 sense either but it was better they took
00:31:07.000 the well it wasn't editing it was fraud
00:31:09.320 yeah this was not editing you know
00:31:10.559 editing is where I'll give an answer and
00:31:12.880 they'll take a couple of words and
00:31:14.159 change them around or they might even
00:31:15.440 take a sentence or two off which is very
00:31:17.399 bad but that's it's sort of bad you know
00:31:19.799 I'd give an answer which was a very good
00:31:21.480 answer I always talk about you know I
00:31:24.120 like to give long The Weave you know I
00:31:26.279 like to you like to weave things in yeah
00:31:28.200 but when you do the weaves and you have
00:31:29.840 to be very smart to do weaves when you
00:31:31.600 do the weave look at this just in this
00:31:33.519 one thing we're talking about little
00:31:34.720 pieces here but always ends up no no it
00:31:37.440 comes back home for the right people for
00:31:39.360 the wrong people it doesn't come back
00:31:40.639 home when they end up in the wilderness
00:31:42.240 right but but they can take my answer
00:31:46.200 and you know what they may take a little
00:31:47.600 piece of it out or something and they
00:31:49.320 use the term yes we want to save time
00:31:51.639 well it's not but I've never heard I
00:31:54.799 think it's the biggest scandal in
00:31:56.200 broadcast history what happened to C CBS
00:31:59.480 so you have CBS 60 minutes that's a news
00:32:01.639 program it's not an entertainment
00:32:03.320 program it's under their news it's the
00:32:04.880 head of their news thing she gives an
00:32:07.399 answer that was that shows that she's
00:32:09.799 essentially
00:32:11.200 incompetent and they took the answer
00:32:13.440 could you imagine them doing that for me
00:32:14.760 we can show it if you want people to see
00:32:16.480 it can we show it no we get in trouble
00:32:18.760 we'll get copyright strike okay I'll
00:32:21.600 listen anyone can find it but it's it's
00:32:24.120 drastic but what was interesting was the
00:32:27.039 other full
00:32:28.440 version was available initially it was
00:32:30.600 like a preview they somebody made a big
00:32:32.360 mistake somebody put that preview out
00:32:33.720 there put the preview out and then the
00:32:36.000 bosses did this or that and then all of
00:32:37.799 a sudden they said we got a problem ex
00:32:39.480 exactly and then they got caught by
00:32:41.440 mistake well you but don't you think
00:32:43.480 that's a bit to me and don't forget this
00:32:45.799 is election interference and fraud and
00:32:49.080 it's 60 minutes it's their news division
00:32:52.600 so they it's a big deal they give those
00:32:54.720 licenses out Joe for free they should
00:32:57.440 pay for Fortune they're worth a fortune
00:32:59.360 they give them out for free because
00:33:01.360 they're using the public Airwaves with
00:33:03.720 cable you don't have that Cable's
00:33:05.320 different but you know it it's just a
00:33:08.200 different deal but with the networks
00:33:10.039 they give those license they're worth
00:33:12.000 billions of dollars they give them out
00:33:14.200 free but you have to be honest and all
00:33:16.080 that was bad I think that David mure and
00:33:18.440 that woman that was aside I never even
00:33:20.320 heard of her but they kept interrupting
00:33:22.519 me it was like I said how many people am
00:33:24.320 I debating here I got this one and I got
00:33:26.480 you two but he went after me 11
00:33:29.279 different times you know it's
00:33:30.480 interesting I always thought he was a
00:33:32.399 nice guy but he's just like the rest of
00:33:34.120 him you know well that's his job
00:33:36.399 unfortunately and I'm I'm sure they want
00:33:39.039 you're right well the problem was they
00:33:41.000 fact checked you and they didn't fact
00:33:42.799 check her and one of most egregious
00:33:44.440 examples of that was when she said that
00:33:47.080 there is there are no troops right now
00:33:49.600 deployed in war zones there's a very
00:33:52.039 famous viral video that went online of
00:33:54.000 troops in a war zone saying well what
00:33:56.760 the are we then because there's
00:33:59.320 thousands of them Dan khaw the
00:34:01.600 congressman uh posted on his Instagram
00:34:04.720 all of the various examples of troops
00:34:08.760 that are deployed thousands and
00:34:10.239 thousands of troops that are currently
00:34:11.719 deployed stupidly deployed but the point
00:34:13.399 is if this is going to be an actual real
00:34:15.839 debate and not a propaganda exercise if
00:34:17.879 it's going to be a real debate you have
00:34:19.040 to fact check everybody like if someone
00:34:21.440 says maybe she thought there was no
00:34:23.800 which is also a problem so it's one of
00:34:25.639 two things it's either it was not true
00:34:28.639 was a lie on purpose which is terrible
00:34:31.320 or it was the opposite it was ignorance
00:34:34.040 which is also terrible well you when I
00:34:35.760 said crime is soaring he said no no
00:34:38.480 crime has gone down I said where did you
00:34:40.879 hear that one crime has gone down I mean
00:34:42.960 I'm debating with this guy but I've had
00:34:45.760 that well there was amended FBI
00:34:47.119 statistics that came out after that that
00:34:49.079 showed the crime had gone up
00:34:50.280 substantially and by the way the
00:34:51.359 statistics were a fraud because when
00:34:53.599 they put out the statistics they didn't
00:34:55.320 include some of the worst places they
00:34:56.918 didn't include some of the worst cities
00:34:58.800 some of the most deadly places but when
00:35:01.480 the real numbers came out I turned out
00:35:03.119 to be right but I haven't you turn out
00:35:04.599 to be right but then there's another
00:35:05.880 problem unreported crime is way up
00:35:08.280 because people have lost look the morale
00:35:10.440 that the police department has in a lot
00:35:12.000 of these cities where they've done this
00:35:13.079 defund the police these the
00:35:15.240 morale these poor cops it's
00:35:16.920 horrible it's the dumbest idea of all
00:35:18.880 time but what they've done is they've
00:35:21.320 they've made these cops feel terrible
00:35:23.359 like good cops I think cops are just
00:35:25.480 like everybody else most of them are
00:35:27.160 great it's like everybody else but if
00:35:28.839 you run into one Carpenter and he does a
00:35:30.680 shitty job in your house you say
00:35:32.440 Carpenters suck but they don't
00:35:34.240 suck most of them are great and that's
00:35:36.400 the with cops but the point is like they
00:35:39.119 they did all of these things in this
00:35:41.960 very foolish way and these cops are
00:35:44.920 suffering the consequences of it and so
00:35:46.520 subsequently what happens is a lot of
00:35:48.560 crime is unreported a lot of crime like
00:35:51.160 you call the cops they're too busy they
00:35:52.800 can't even get you or your house got
00:35:54.040 broken into sorry you know it doesn't
00:35:56.839 even make a report there's a lot of
00:35:58.480 people that they just give up it's so
00:36:01.480 sad what's happened and I'll tell you
00:36:03.160 what uh I go to police funerals and we
00:36:07.280 went to one in Long Island I visited the
00:36:09.400 family in Long Island a very big deal
00:36:12.319 it's so dangerous people don't realiz
00:36:14.640 the car dark Windows pull over he's a
00:36:19.079 gentleman please pull over door opens
00:36:21.359 guy comes out
00:36:22.599 firing even if they were allowed to pull
00:36:24.920 out their gun which they're not they
00:36:26.640 can't you know pull out time they still
00:36:28.680 wouldn't have time it's every cop's
00:36:29.680 worst nightmare it they open a door and
00:36:33.240 he was killed and his partner was hurt
00:36:35.400 he was killed and you don't have I mean
00:36:38.400 you don't even have an eighth of a
00:36:39.800 second to think and it is such a
00:36:42.560 dangerous job that in particular think
00:36:44.800 of it you go up to a car you don't know
00:36:46.319 who's sitting there with a gun and if
00:36:47.800 they have a gun you really don't have a
00:36:49.839 chance you're not allowed to have your
00:36:50.960 gun out by the way you have they have
00:36:52.160 very strict rules so number one there're
00:36:55.200 but even if you could have your gun out
00:36:57.880 the door opens and a guy and bullets
00:36:59.560 start firing out you know and especially
00:37:01.880 where they have the dark Windows where
00:37:03.319 they have the darkened Windows it is
00:37:05.280 such a dangerous POS uh profession and
00:37:08.359 it's very hard to get cops now because
00:37:11.000 they they're not given any backup and
00:37:13.599 you're right you can you know they have
00:37:15.560 like an eighth of a second to make a
00:37:17.160 decision that's going to change their
00:37:18.560 life if they make the wrong decision
00:37:20.640 they're going to end up on the front
00:37:21.720 page of every newspaper in in the
00:37:23.920 country and they're going to lose their
00:37:25.800 house and their pension and their their
00:37:27.599 job and their wife is going to be gone
00:37:29.319 and everything's going to be gone abely
00:37:30.680 and there here's another thing that
00:37:31.680 people don't talk about how many of them
00:37:32.920 have PTSD probably most of them these
00:37:35.960 guys are seeing people shot all the time
00:37:37.960 you know I I've talked to a ton of cops
00:37:40.200 about it and you know a lot of cops
00:37:41.839 commit suicide a lot of cops are deeply
00:37:43.880 depressed a lot of but we have to give
00:37:45.880 them back their dignity we have to we
00:37:48.520 can't we just have to give them back you
00:37:51.000 said it's so good you you never hear so
00:37:53.079 anybody say that you're never going to
00:37:54.839 have it perfect you're going to have a
00:37:56.000 bad apple in everything every profession
00:37:58.560 but every time there's a bad apple that
00:38:00.119 gets massive publicity and it it taints
00:38:02.920 everybody else but it's also this very
00:38:04.400 irresponsible thing where people say
00:38:06.160 defund the police get rid of the police
00:38:07.960 you know even com Harris was a part of
00:38:09.520 that that it's a it's a very stupid way
00:38:11.800 to look at it what you should do is fund
00:38:13.319 the police you should have better
00:38:14.480 training you should have cops that feel
00:38:16.800 more appreciated you do you should have
00:38:18.560 some something that helps mitigate this
00:38:20.560 PTSD that all of them suffer through
00:38:22.560 right she was a big part of defund the
00:38:25.520 police that was a big thing for her
00:38:26.880 defund the police always to fund the
00:38:28.440 police well was it's a political idea
00:38:31.200 but any anybody with that political
00:38:33.040 thought I don't think should be running
00:38:34.880 for president and I think people are
00:38:36.400 getting wise to it you know we're doing
00:38:38.839 pretty well now I don't know maybe in a
00:38:40.319 week from now say sorry about that I was
00:38:42.359 wrong but we're leading everything and I
00:38:45.200 think we're going to have a very good
00:38:46.560 election but I tell because people are
00:38:48.880 starting to get to know her but she was
00:38:51.319 defund the police she was all these
00:38:53.599 transgender operations you know if you
00:38:56.079 wanted a sex change and you were in
00:38:57.720 detention and you demanded a sex change
00:39:00.400 they would give you a sex change well
00:39:02.119 the wildest one is this idea of giving
00:39:04.920 free sex change to illegal immigrants
00:39:07.240 that's right in detention that is the
00:39:10.520 wildest thing is that the biggest
00:39:12.880 problem you have you just walked here
00:39:14.200 from Guatemala you need to become a girl
00:39:16.160 but she was in favor of it so so think
00:39:18.079 of it she was now she changed she
00:39:20.240 changed 15 policies in fact I'm going to
00:39:23.160 send her a Maga cap she stole your idea
00:39:25.480 about no tax for tips
00:39:27.960 I I came up with this idea that honestly
00:39:30.400 nobody ever heard of and all now it took
00:39:33.160 her two months but you know what all of
00:39:34.760 a sudden it what caught fire and she
00:39:36.319 just put it into a little speech yeah
00:39:38.079 well I think we have I think we still
00:39:40.000 have that issue I think that issue is a
00:39:41.400 good one for us but um no we have a lot
00:39:44.000 of good issues you know we had the the
00:39:45.440 other day think of how simple some of
00:39:46.960 these things are we're trying to get
00:39:48.599 cars built in the United States Detroit
00:39:50.599 has been really tough It's been a
00:39:52.280 disaster they have a huge Factory a huge
00:39:55.079 car auto plant being built by China in
00:39:57.400 Mexico make cars sell them in the United
00:39:58.960 States put everybody out of business
00:40:00.480 right here we go again I said if that
00:40:03.319 plant is there when I'm president I will
00:40:05.560 put 100 or 200% tariffs on every car
00:40:09.240 they'll be unsalable in the United
00:40:11.200 States and they just announced they're
00:40:13.160 not going to build the plant because
00:40:14.400 they think I'm going to win think of it
00:40:15.800 they're not going to build the plant
00:40:17.440 this was the biggest plant in the world
00:40:19.960 it would have more than all of Michigan
00:40:22.640 makes that's how big you know this is
00:40:24.400 what we're getting to and I said if that
00:40:28.079 plan goes up I want them to understand
00:40:30.440 if I win I'm going to tax those cars at
00:40:33.319 the rate of a 100 or 200% of piece so
00:40:36.119 that you won't be able to sell them in
00:40:37.520 the United States they just announced
00:40:39.280 they're not going to build a plan yeah I
00:40:40.720 read that I did a big favor for our
00:40:43.960 country by doing that and I'm not even
00:40:45.920 there yet to me the most beautiful word
00:40:48.640 and I've said this for the last couple
00:40:49.920 of weeks in the dictionary today and any
00:40:53.319 is the word tariff it's more beautiful
00:40:56.880 than love it's more beautiful than
00:40:58.560 anything it's the most beautiful word
00:41:01.520 this country can become rich with the
00:41:04.520 use the proper use of tariffs it'll keep
00:41:07.599 did you just float out the idea of
00:41:09.960 getting rid of income taxes and
00:41:11.760 replacing it with tariffs well okay were
00:41:13.880 we serious about that our yeah sure why
00:41:15.839 not because we ready our country was the
00:41:19.079 richest in the relatively in the 1880s
00:41:22.520 and
00:41:23.599 1890s a president who was assassinated
00:41:26.319 named McKinley he was the Tariff King he
00:41:29.160 spoke beautifully of terce his his
00:41:31.720 language was really beautiful uh we will
00:41:34.839 not allow the enemy to come in and take
00:41:38.160 our jobs and take our factories and take
00:41:40.839 our workers and take our families unless
00:41:43.560 they pay a big price and the big price
00:41:45.839 is tariffs and he'd speak like that but
00:41:49.160 he was right and then around in the
00:41:51.520 early 1900s they switched over stupidly
00:41:53.760 to frankly an income tax and you know
00:41:56.520 why because countries were putting a lot
00:41:58.160 of pressure in America we don't want to
00:41:59.599 pay tariffs please don't you you know
00:42:01.079 they believe me they control our
00:42:03.560 politicians if you look at the kind of
00:42:05.880 numbers that these guys make then and
00:42:09.240 now but we had a commission meeting in
00:42:13.599 the uh 18 I think it was 1887 think of
00:42:17.280 this problem we were so rich we had so
00:42:21.040 much money we didn't know what to do so
00:42:23.480 they set up a blue ribbon Commission on
00:42:26.160 tariffs and the sole purpose is what to
00:42:29.559 do with all the money we had we were so
00:42:32.400 rich because we were taxing other people
00:42:35.160 for coming in and taking our jobs and
00:42:38.599 China does it that's what China did if
00:42:40.400 you want to open a factory and sell cars
00:42:43.240 if you build a factory or have a factory
00:42:45.400 they don't take our cars they they
00:42:46.920 wouldn't take our cars but if you build
00:42:49.359 a plant in China you can do that Elon
00:42:52.839 did that by the way Elon is great that
00:42:55.119 guy is such a great guy I think you're a
00:42:57.400 fan of he is from a different planet
00:43:00.760 he's the greatest guy that rocket coming
00:43:03.280 in I talk I'm I'm I told the story once
00:43:06.520 or twice so you may have heard it
00:43:08.960 because his speeches have been good did
00:43:10.280 you see the one last night yeah 29,000
00:43:12.720 people that was a and the one the night
00:43:14.680 before was the same thing we are we are
00:43:17.280 rocking and rolling but but Elon and I'm
00:43:20.400 talking to this very important guy I
00:43:22.839 said wait a minute I'm looking at
00:43:24.119 something the television's on muted
00:43:25.920 right and I see just rocket it's all
00:43:28.880 Brown from the heat you know like 10,000
00:43:32.119 Dees pouring down at thousands of miles
00:43:34.240 an hour and I see this thing you know
00:43:36.559 it's like a 20 story building and it
00:43:38.319 catches and I say to this guy's an
00:43:39.720 important guy wait a minute let me just
00:43:42.839 put you to hold it I got to see this and
00:43:45.760 I see this and and it's going to crash I
00:43:47.640 say it's going to crash into the Gantry
00:43:49.319 they call it a Gantry I said oh man
00:43:51.599 that's got to be a disaster cuz it's
00:43:53.119 starting to get very close and then all
00:43:54.800 of a sudden you see the flames in the
00:43:56.319 bottom
00:43:57.680 and it boom and then you see the two
00:43:59.200 arms grab it crazy and I forgot the guy
00:44:02.079 I had him on the phone I forgot no I
00:44:04.400 said the hell with no I called Elon I
00:44:06.960 said was that you he said that was me
00:44:09.359 and I said who else can do that he said
00:44:10.920 nobody Russia can't do it the United
00:44:12.760 States nobody can do it you know I set
00:44:15.000 up space force that was me and that's
00:44:16.839 the first time in 82 years that we
00:44:18.720 opened another Branch since the Air
00:44:20.960 Force and that's going to be one of our
00:44:23.040 most important things but think of what
00:44:24.960 Elon does and he did one other thing
00:44:27.160 that I never heard of it it's uh
00:44:30.760 starlink I went down to North Carolina
00:44:33.400 Georgia the different places right I
00:44:35.359 followed it right down and they had no
00:44:38.119 communication the polls were all knocked
00:44:39.960 down every and one of the guys in North
00:44:42.400 Carolina said could you do me a favor do
00:44:45.559 you know Elon Musk yes he endorsed me by
00:44:48.280 the way he gave me the nicest
00:44:49.480 endorsement to this the tougher he said
00:44:51.680 the country's going to fail you should
00:44:53.200 do the same thing Joe because you cannot
00:44:55.800 be voting for Kamala
00:44:57.680 Kamala you're not a Kamala person I know
00:44:59.720 you I've watched you I know him better
00:45:01.720 than he you know what without speaking
00:45:03.520 to you I think I know you maybe almost
00:45:05.280 as well as your wife I have watched you
00:45:07.480 for so many years you're not a Kamala
00:45:09.359 person you're a kabib person but you're
00:45:12.400 not a Kamala person no nobody's going to
00:45:14.960 know who khabib is but oh they know who
00:45:17.480 he was he was not he was not bad right
00:45:19.559 that guy oh he was phenomenal but that's
00:45:21.200 your kind of your weave is getting wide
00:45:22.800 we're getting wide with this weave I
00:45:24.440 want to bring it back to ter but wait
00:45:26.160 one sec before we finished with tariffs
00:45:27.599 I just so they said they said could you
00:45:30.400 get him we need starlink and I call Elon
00:45:33.319 he got it for him so fast saved so many
00:45:35.280 lives and I said how was it they said
00:45:37.839 better than the wires you know they
00:45:39.720 couldn't put them in they were all they
00:45:41.280 were all gone so getting I used it
00:45:43.119 recently in Utah in the mountains did
00:45:44.880 you find it good oh it's phenomenal it's
00:45:46.400 the size of a like a iPad you just set
00:45:48.920 it down on the ground you get highspeed
00:45:50.280 internet it's incredible we're spending
00:45:52.000 just to show you we're spending a
00:45:54.760 trillion dollars to get tables all over
00:45:57.880 the country right up to Upstate areas
00:46:01.480 where you have like two farms and
00:46:02.960 they're spending millions of dollars to
00:46:04.480 have talk about the 42 billion doll that
00:46:07.280 was wasted on this Internet access
00:46:09.720 program the United they didn't get
00:46:11.400 anybody access inter they haven't hooked
00:46:13.800 up one person yet not one person they
00:46:15.160 spent $42 billion they could have gotten
00:46:17.359 starlinks to everybody with that kind of
00:46:19.559 money for almost nothing yeah for a
00:46:21.640 monthly charge and it would have been
00:46:23.000 incredible and it's high speed internet
00:46:24.839 everywhere you want to go and he wanted
00:46:26.400 to do that and he wanted to do it how
00:46:27.920 about this they they built uh the
00:46:30.359 charger stations right in the Midwest
00:46:33.440 Midwest they built eight of them they
00:46:36.319 cost billion dollar that's like a gas
00:46:38.680 pump right they built nine gas pumps
00:46:41.200 except electricity comes out they spent
00:46:43.880 n billion three of them don't work the
00:46:46.880 whole thing there's so much waste I
00:46:49.480 could I could sit here and tell you
00:46:50.720 about things that that there's so much
00:46:53.880 waste abuse and fraud oh there's yeah
00:46:58.160 I'm I'm sure I mean I think everybody's
00:47:00.000 aware of that now let's get back to ter
00:47:01.319 when when you're talking about one of
00:47:02.839 the criticisms of your Administration
00:47:04.599 was with tax cuts and with tariffs you
00:47:07.040 increase the
00:47:08.359 deficit so was the Strate what was the
00:47:12.359 strategy behind that and did you think
00:47:14.119 it was going to increase the deficit uh
00:47:16.440 by a substantial amount I okay we were
00:47:18.640 ready to Ruck it was all you know I had
00:47:21.359 a bad system we had horrible tax policy
00:47:24.559 I made it great with a much lower tax
00:47:28.280 rate so I took it from almost 40% down
00:47:31.079 to
00:47:31.960 21% now I'm bringing it from 21 down to
00:47:34.720 15 but only if you make your product in
00:47:38.040 the United States which is great people
00:47:40.359 call me they said what a great idea
00:47:41.920 nobody ever heard of that before I don't
00:47:43.520 care if they make the product in Japan
00:47:45.240 why should I give them so it's a 21 that
00:47:48.960 at 21 in the first year we took in much
00:47:52.839 more Revenue than we did at almost 40
00:47:55.319 think of that it inspired now we had
00:47:57.960 other things too we we were able to get
00:48:00.079 people to bring back their money you
00:48:01.920 couldn't you couldn't bring back your
00:48:03.440 money if you had money in Europe like
00:48:06.720 apple apple had many billions of dollars
00:48:10.119 outside they couldn't bring it there was
00:48:11.400 no way to bring it back in uh the
00:48:13.680 bureaucracy the documents the whole
00:48:15.680 thing and also the tax was too high you
00:48:17.400 know they wanted like half of it or
00:48:18.720 something nobody's going to do that so
00:48:20.079 they they leave their money in Japan and
00:48:22.720 and they spend their money there that
00:48:25.119 was part of what I did the money came
00:48:27.280 pouring back in apple took in hundreds
00:48:29.359 of billions of dollars they brought it
00:48:30.760 back from overseas they brought it in so
00:48:32.480 how does the deficit increase because of
00:48:33.960 that so what happened is this we were
00:48:36.000 ready to rock and roll and then we had
00:48:38.400 the co thing and we had to focus on that
00:48:41.559 and if we didn't give some businesses a
00:48:44.960 hand that would have all you would have
00:48:46.160 had a depression like in
00:48:47.880 1929 but we were ready to start we were
00:48:50.559 going to we would have very shortly been
00:48:52.920 paying off debt you know we have $35
00:48:55.160 trillion in debt
00:48:57.280 and I'll never forget it we were it was
00:48:59.880 talking about uh from you know the
00:49:01.920 standpoint of being in office I'm in the
00:49:04.400 Oval Office and I have John McLaughlin
00:49:07.040 and Fabrizio they're two very good
00:49:09.160 pollsters probably I don't know I would
00:49:10.680 say the two best who knows but very good
00:49:13.040 pollsters and we're starting to think
00:49:15.359 about running for a second term and we
00:49:19.520 had the greatest economy in history
00:49:22.280 never has there been an economy like and
00:49:24.000 you attribute that to lowering taxes tff
00:49:26.960 two things and also I cut regulations
00:49:28.839 more than anybody
00:49:30.240 else and if I asked many of the
00:49:32.880 businessmen you know from the big
00:49:34.280 companies you know the guys running the
00:49:35.640 big companies I'd say so if you had your
00:49:37.720 choice you've had it now for a long time
00:49:40.440 what's more important to you the tax
00:49:42.520 cuts you paid less tax or the regulation
00:49:45.400 Cuts every one of them said the
00:49:47.559 regulation Cuts meant more who would
00:49:49.920 think that right because you don't
00:49:51.480 equate it to dollars but it actually is
00:49:53.079 more dollars um we had going and then we
00:49:57.880 just had to focus on something else but
00:50:00.280 they were sitting there these two these
00:50:01.839 two pollsters were sitting there and
00:50:04.559 they said sir if George Washington came
00:50:07.680 back and Abraham Lincoln was his VP as
00:50:11.640 opposed to waltz how bad is he by the
00:50:14.200 way but if Abraham Lincoln was his VP
00:50:18.040 they couldn't beat you you have and I'll
00:50:21.160 never forget it the following day they
00:50:24.079 said something's happening in China sir
00:50:27.440 could we meet I said what's happening
00:50:30.200 people are dying and it was all around
00:50:32.839 the Wuhan lab by the way there are
00:50:35.319 pictures with little lines their body
00:50:38.400 bags all around the Wuhan lab and I
00:50:42.119 always said that from the beginning Joe
00:50:43.559 was you know they tried to say first
00:50:44.960 they said it was France and you know
00:50:46.520 they blamed everybody but then they say
00:50:48.760 it was bats from a cave 2,000 miles away
00:50:51.799 so we got hit with that and despite that
00:50:55.799 we had the best economy and when I gave
00:50:58.119 it over the stock market was higher than
00:51:01.160 it was preo I mean nobody could even
00:51:03.680 believe it but we saved it and we were
00:51:07.960 helping businesses they were dying you
00:51:10.040 know they were D so it's your belief
00:51:11.839 that if you had a second term given the
00:51:14.480 policies in place the way the economy
00:51:16.599 was booming that you would have been
00:51:18.160 able to pay off a lot of the debt and
00:51:20.480 that we didn't have Co we would have
00:51:22.839 been paying off debt and we would have
00:51:24.960 had and don't forget by growth the word
00:51:28.000 growth is actually more important in a
00:51:29.640 way because you could have the same debt
00:51:30.920 but if you double your growth all of a
00:51:32.400 sudden you're under levered but still we
00:51:35.240 should pay off debt you know if you view
00:51:37.960 this um $35 trillion right now it's a
00:51:41.760 lot but if you look at the asset value
00:51:44.000 if you looked at it purely as an asset
00:51:45.760 value we have oil underground we have
00:51:49.359 water we have mountains we have the I
00:51:51.200 mean the assets are so enormous but
00:51:54.920 regardless of that we've got 35 trillion
00:51:57.680 in debt we should pay it off and we
00:51:59.760 would have started paying off debt and
00:52:01.839 probably even giving further given
00:52:04.359 further tax reductions I want to get it
00:52:07.040 down to 15% we're going to do more
00:52:09.599 business but when you get hit with a CO
00:52:12.040 everything stops and you have to keep
00:52:13.720 these businesses alive the businesses
00:52:15.240 were dying I mean they were just dying
00:52:17.559 this whole place this country was going
00:52:18.880 to die are there influences um outside
00:52:22.200 of environmental that keep people from
00:52:24.960 wanting to drill for oil and Frack and
00:52:27.520 and do those sort of things outside of
00:52:29.000 the environmental concerns which are
00:52:30.559 legitimate of course no I but are there
00:52:33.200 other influences that maybe over
00:52:36.440 accentuate or OV exaggerate these
00:52:39.079 environmental effects are are people
00:52:40.680 being influenced in a way where they're
00:52:42.799 trying to keep us from producing
00:52:45.240 American Oil yeah yeah so the
00:52:48.760 environmental is the biggest tool for
00:52:50.760 stopping growth the biggest tool the
00:52:52.760 other is
00:52:54.040 regulation and if you speak to Elon he
00:52:56.520 to the regulation now to send a rocket
00:52:58.359 up to anywhere even if you do everything
00:53:00.760 it's it's almost it's becoming
00:53:04.200 impossible but they use environmental in
00:53:07.680 order to get people not to do anything
00:53:12.200 and sometimes I say you know I look at
00:53:15.160 some of the I know the environmental
00:53:16.839 stuff better because I had to build
00:53:18.000 buildings in New York I had to build I
00:53:19.440 had to do environmental impact studies
00:53:21.799 and I would see some of these guys that
00:53:23.280 i' hire for a lot of money
00:53:24.720 environmentalists that would get you
00:53:26.119 through the process and they' be up in
00:53:28.599 Albany that's the capital of New York
00:53:30.280 and they're up they're trying to make it
00:53:32.319 tougher for guys like me that were
00:53:34.920 Builders because they'd get ba paid more
00:53:37.480 money in other words I I had one guy uh
00:53:41.960 highly recommended all you know I was
00:53:43.760 good at getting permits I was one of the
00:53:45.480 kings of I was always very good but the
00:53:48.079 environmental stuff was always horrible
00:53:51.040 they could slow a project down 10 years
00:53:53.480 15 years I had a project in Louisiana
00:53:55.960 built big LG plant it was uh for 14
00:54:00.520 years it was going to cost1 18 million
00:54:02.839 $18 billion one of the biggest like the
00:54:05.160 Empire State Building laying down on the
00:54:06.760 side times four massive in the coast on
00:54:10.200 the Gulf
00:54:11.079 Coast and they said sir are they're
00:54:12.960 going to give it up I said that they
00:54:14.280 shouldn't give it up what's the problem
00:54:15.599 they can't get their environmental they
00:54:17.200 had environmental permits that would
00:54:19.480 fill this whole room up to the ceiling
00:54:22.119 and they said there was one mistake on
00:54:23.640 one little line they wanted to do it all
00:54:25.760 over again it's not going to happen and
00:54:28.640 I got them their permit instantly and
00:54:32.480 they built the plant it's massive so
00:54:34.480 when you're saying that so there's
00:54:37.079 there's people that are making money by
00:54:38.559 making it difficult are you talking
00:54:40.400 about lawyers because they're dring
00:54:42.400 about environmental consultants and
00:54:44.040 lawyers environmental Consultants profit
00:54:46.559 off of dragging out the process
00:54:48.240 absolutely and process worse how do they
00:54:51.359 i' probably do the same thing about with
00:54:52.920 them to be honest with you you I want to
00:54:54.680 be honest with you how do they do that
00:54:56.400 how do they make it they go let's say
00:54:58.040 New York they go to Albany okay and they
00:55:00.200 convince people that if you have a
00:55:02.040 certain type of plant on the ground
00:55:03.640 that's this big and in theory valous
00:55:06.559 that it's a rare plant and you cannot
00:55:09.319 ever even touch it you can't go near it
00:55:12.599 you can't put a building on it you can't
00:55:14.799 do anything or there's a little puddle
00:55:18.079 and they call it a lake and you have to
00:55:20.160 go by the standards of a lake I said no
00:55:22.280 no that's a puddle oh you have no idea
00:55:25.000 guys are filling a little puddle
00:55:26.839 you have no idea what they do and they
00:55:29.400 use it as a way to stop you they use it
00:55:31.520 as a way to stop you and also as the way
00:55:33.359 to generate money I'm I'm curious how
00:55:35.760 how are they generating money that way
00:55:37.160 though well they get fees they get fees
00:55:39.319 massive fees and you pay these guys
00:55:41.319 people rely on them as experts because
00:55:44.039 they're the people that they go to when
00:55:45.680 they have to run these studies in the
00:55:47.039 first place but some of them are just
00:55:48.400 bad guys and they're trying to make it
00:55:50.039 more and more difficult and they have a
00:55:51.319 lot of power uh yeah I I think they
00:55:54.000 maybe had more they didn't have as much
00:55:55.640 with me because because I would get
00:55:57.480 through them and I understood it look
00:55:59.680 I've had I've done so many envir they
00:56:01.640 call it environmental impact study I did
00:56:04.480 so much to build a building to build a
00:56:06.079 building in New York is very tough you
00:56:07.640 got to be very you got to deal with
00:56:09.640 think of it financing
00:56:12.440 unions uh all the municipal stuff
00:56:16.400 environmental of all of it to me the
00:56:18.599 toughest thing was the environmental
00:56:20.920 because they could stop you cold with
00:56:23.240 the environmental impact study stuff and
00:56:25.760 and you deal you hire a so-called expert
00:56:28.079 they say sir he's the one guy he can get
00:56:30.440 you through the morass it's a morass
00:56:32.280 it's horrible they use it as a weapon
00:56:34.440 they use it all over the country right
00:56:35.799 but there are legitimate concerns about
00:56:37.680 environmental impact correct like look
00:56:39.440 about the BP oil spill there's a lot of
00:56:41.440 things that do happen that are
00:56:42.880 environmentally devastating and you want
00:56:44.960 to mitigate that as much as possible you
00:56:47.039 do look I I had during our four years we
00:56:49.520 had the cleanest air in the cleanest
00:56:51.079 water I view it differently I say air
00:56:54.599 and water remember this it costs much
00:56:57.480 more to do things environmentally clean
00:57:01.079 China doesn't do anything right when
00:57:03.160 Carrie goes to see uh president Chia
00:57:06.440 China which he probably doesn't even get
00:57:08.559 to see him but they look at him oh yes
00:57:11.319 yes we will do oh yes yes we're going to
00:57:13.160 do that no more coal no more coal just
00:57:15.240 and then they approve 58 coal plants for
00:57:17.359 the next you know every they build a
00:57:19.079 coal plant a week okay they build a lot
00:57:21.240 of coal plants we but let me just say
00:57:22.960 though so here we are cleaning and
00:57:24.760 scrubbing everything and everything
00:57:26.559 the's got to be pure but in 3.8
00:57:30.839 days that stuff floating over China is
00:57:33.599 right over the top of us right same
00:57:35.720 thing with the oceans they dump their
00:57:38.480 garbage into the Pacific Ocean if you
00:57:41.880 take a little Cork and put it there in
00:57:44.680 about a week and a half it'll be in
00:57:46.079 front of Los
00:57:47.440 Angeles we're picking up their garbage
00:57:50.880 so nobody ever talks about that but in a
00:57:53.720 way the bigger one is even the air it's
00:57:56.240 occurrence it's an amazing thing it's
00:57:58.599 been flowing that way for a million
00:58:00.640 years so long before we share with the
00:58:03.039 whole world yeah no if we're the Sahara
00:58:06.280 dust clouds over here absolutely we get
00:58:08.319 dust clouds in Austin from the Sahara
00:58:10.039 desert but we get the China you know
00:58:13.240 they call it the China curse we get the
00:58:15.280 China curse they're better and their air
00:58:18.000 is dirty you know when I went there uh I
00:58:20.720 had a great relationship with President
00:58:22.559 she we got along very well and they
00:58:25.039 treated me better than anybody has ever
00:58:27.079 been treated same thing with Saudi
00:58:28.559 Arabia number of them but they laid it
00:58:31.960 out and I said this air is good do you
00:58:34.720 know they closed every Factory one week
00:58:37.640 before I got there from within 200 miles
00:58:40.599 that's like what Gavin Nome did when XI
00:58:42.280 Jing ping came to San Francisco he
00:58:44.280 cleaned it up he got rid of all the
00:58:46.400 terrible in away to think you know he
00:58:48.760 cleaned it up and then it became a pigi
00:58:51.119 well the dumbest thing is he said when
00:58:52.960 your friends come by when you have
00:58:54.559 visitors you clean up your house
00:58:56.559 like how about just keep your
00:58:57.720 house clean can you imagine that's the
00:58:59.520 dumbest thing I've ever heard anybody
00:59:00.799 say ever as a governor as to excuse to
00:59:03.400 why you finally cleaned up your homeless
00:59:05.480 problem and the day he left right back
00:59:07.760 to it went right back yeah but in a way
00:59:10.880 that was a bad thing that he did because
00:59:12.640 he
00:59:13.400 showed what a disgrace that was what a
00:59:16.359 disgrace well this is the thing that
00:59:18.280 like shows you how foolish a lot of
00:59:20.559 these people that are running these
00:59:21.559 cities think a lot of these people that
00:59:23.200 are running these states think it's it's
00:59:24.920 foolish like you you're insulting the
00:59:27.520 intelligence of the people that live in
00:59:29.079 that City that are impacted by these
00:59:31.799 people just camping and needles and
00:59:34.680 human feces there's a an app that you
00:59:37.039 can buy there's an app that you can get
00:59:39.039 rather that will show you where the
00:59:40.799 human feces has been documented in San
00:59:43.559 Francisco it's a poo app and it's just
00:59:46.200 everywhere it's just bum crap everywhere
00:59:48.480 but let let me give you one that you may
00:59:50.480 not know okay which I think you know
00:59:52.640 everything actually as a student as a
00:59:55.039 student of yours
00:59:56.720 but but water you know in Los Angeles
01:00:01.079 you can't get proper amounts of water
01:00:03.480 right and it's unbelievably expensive
01:00:05.400 and you might have a house in Beverly
01:00:06.880 Hills and they're actually thinking
01:00:08.599 about rationing water can you believe it
01:00:11.079 I can believe it I was in I was in the
01:00:13.280 farm Court country with some of the
01:00:15.039 congressmen were driving up a highway
01:00:17.680 and I say how come all this land is
01:00:20.240 so Barren it's farmland and it looked
01:00:24.400 terrible it was just Brown and bad I
01:00:27.039 said but there's always that little
01:00:28.599 corner that's so green and beautiful
01:00:32.520 they said we have no water I said do you
01:00:35.079 have a drought no we don't have a
01:00:36.440 drought I said why don't you have no
01:00:38.039 water because the water isn't allowed to
01:00:40.359 flow down it's got a natural flow from
01:00:42.480 Canada all the way up North water more
01:00:44.720 water than they could ever use and in
01:00:47.559 order to protect a tiny little fish uh
01:00:50.880 the Water up north gets routed into the
01:00:54.359 Pacific Ocean millions of millions of
01:00:56.799 gallons of water gets poured you get to
01:00:59.160 see this we're driving up and I had
01:01:01.079 never seen it before it's the most it's
01:01:03.520 like Iowa it's the most fertile land
01:01:05.559 Iowa was blessed with great land Idaho
01:01:08.119 for a potato right but these they
01:01:10.640 they're just by the way you know some
01:01:12.400 land is good for a potato some land is
01:01:14.240 good for corn it's the craziest thing I
01:01:15.799 love the farmers that great they're the
01:01:17.640 greatest and by the way they're getting
01:01:19.000 killed right now they they're getting
01:01:20.480 killed because of this stupid
01:01:21.760 Administration but so I see this and I
01:01:24.760 said you got to be kidding
01:01:26.880 I said you mean you have water and I
01:01:28.760 looked at it it's like a valve in your
01:01:31.119 sink except it's massive the thing's
01:01:33.240 five times taller than your ceiling did
01:01:35.160 you know the center of California was a
01:01:36.799 giant
01:01:37.640 Lake they have so much water you ever
01:01:39.680 see what it looks like before they
01:01:40.880 rerouted saw that the center of
01:01:42.480 California like what is it 200 years ago
01:01:45.000 how long ago did they do that Jamie the
01:01:47.359 the center of California had a
01:01:49.559 enormous Lake in the middle of
01:01:51.200 California so they dumped it into the
01:01:52.680 Pacific who knows what they did but what
01:01:55.960 whatever foolishness that they did led
01:01:58.240 to the situation that they're in now
01:01:59.960 think of those dry forests that burn
01:02:02.599 down all over the you know the head of
01:02:04.400 Austria said t lake or Tachi Lake uh
01:02:08.559 it's a freshwater lake in the Southern
01:02:10.240 sanen Valley United States historically
01:02:13.319 uh T Lake was one of the largest
01:02:14.920 freshwater lakes West of Mississippi
01:02:16.480 show a photo of what it looked like back
01:02:19.319 then it's a great system so that's what
01:02:21.440 it looked like look at that image now
01:02:23.079 the one go to the one on the third from
01:02:24.599 the right yeah yeah that was an enormous
01:02:27.400 Lake in the middle of California imagine
01:02:29.240 that that' be much more valuable
01:02:30.520 property how crazy is that but how crazy
01:02:32.480 is that's what it used to look like and
01:02:33.960 human beings screwed that up no they let
01:02:35.720 it go into the Pacific and then they I
01:02:37.760 don't know what they did what did they
01:02:39.039 do that why did how did it go missing
01:02:41.079 said they drained 83 yeah they drained
01:02:44.200 it
01:02:45.799 19 1983 oh my God it went dry a hand
01:02:49.720 full of times oh went dry a handful of
01:02:52.160 times well you know Lakes do go dry but
01:02:54.720 that's a big one but think of it big one
01:02:56.119 to go you could have all of the water
01:02:58.880 you need all of that land would have
01:03:01.279 more water the whole thing could be like
01:03:03.079 that little patch lit literally I'd say
01:03:05.559 I was with Devon nun as a congressman
01:03:07.240 and other Congressman we were going up I
01:03:09.079 was visiting that because they asked me
01:03:11.079 to go up and visit their territory and I
01:03:13.319 did but I kept saying look at this land
01:03:15.279 it's beautiful but it's so dry and I
01:03:18.119 thought they were going through like a
01:03:19.160 desert like a drought they said no we
01:03:20.760 have water but it gets so I looked into
01:03:23.079 it what is the fish and I got it done I
01:03:25.599 got got it done I could have water for
01:03:28.319 all of that land water for your Forest
01:03:30.960 you know your forests are dry as a bone
01:03:33.160 okay dangerous that water could be
01:03:34.680 routed you know you could have
01:03:36.279 everything oh not only dangerous
01:03:38.680 billions of dollars a year they spend on
01:03:41.039 forest fires and you know there's a case
01:03:42.760 with the environment they're not allowed
01:03:44.599 to rake their Forest because you're not
01:03:47.240 allowed to touch it when a tree foils
01:03:49.359 down after 18 months it becomes very dry
01:03:51.640 it's like you know like real firewood
01:03:53.319 it's bad you know a tree that's these
01:03:56.319 are all things I learned the hard way
01:03:59.480 the easy way but when a tree is up it
01:04:01.720 sucks water it's wet I went to that the
01:04:04.559 hor they had a couple of horrible forest
01:04:06.359 fires in California and I went I said
01:04:08.319 you know you got a lot of trees standing
01:04:09.640 yday were healthy trees sir I said with
01:04:11.960 this intense heat they you could see
01:04:14.119 they were charred a little bit on the
01:04:15.400 bottom but they were going to be all
01:04:16.440 right because they're soaking wet
01:04:18.039 because they suck up the water right but
01:04:20.119 when they fall right they're like you
01:04:22.359 know it's like lighting a match yeah and
01:04:24.640 you got to be able to clean they call
01:04:26.119 maintain your Forest so I was with the
01:04:27.799 head of Austria he said you know it's a
01:04:30.279 shame I see all those forest fires in
01:04:32.520 California and all they have to do is
01:04:34.960 clean their Forest meaning rake it up
01:04:37.559 get rid of the leaves get rid of you
01:04:39.079 know leaves that are sitting there for
01:04:40.559 five years and then we certainly get rid
01:04:42.160 of the Dead Fall and get rid of the
01:04:44.039 trees that have fallen that you know are
01:04:46.520 like uh so many things this country by
01:04:50.440 the way could you really R the whole
01:04:52.240 Forest though I don't think you could
01:04:53.359 rake the whole Forest I think you get
01:04:54.920 rid of the deadall but raking all the Le
01:04:56.839 you could certainly get rid of the Dead
01:04:58.319 okay they the real you know
01:05:00.000 environmentally they don't want to do
01:05:01.319 that they don't they said you know it's
01:05:02.720 got to be nature and all the stuff but
01:05:04.559 in the meantime this is exactly but you
01:05:07.680 could have so it was the Department of
01:05:10.319 Commerce that needed the approvals but
01:05:12.680 Gavin news had a sign them I got it all
01:05:15.520 done nobody could believe it it was all
01:05:17.520 done I said I got it you got so much
01:05:21.799 water all you have to do is sign and
01:05:25.359 that guy didn't want to sign did he not
01:05:27.920 want to sign because that would be a
01:05:29.240 political victory for you I think no he
01:05:30.960 didn't no I don't think so he you know
01:05:33.279 he used to say he's a great president
01:05:35.720 and we got along we did we actually got
01:05:37.440 along at that point but I think somebody
01:05:39.920 said uh you just can't continue to call
01:05:42.400 him a great president you know they they
01:05:44.279 do say that but we had it all done he
01:05:47.039 didn't sign and then we got on to other
01:05:49.200 things and I I every time I go to
01:05:51.720 California said you have so much water
01:05:54.680 they don't know it I'm telling you
01:05:56.640 people living in Beverly Hills they turn
01:05:58.359 off the water same thing with the
01:05:59.559 electric they want to go to all electric
01:06:01.559 cars but they have brownouts every
01:06:03.079 weekend you know well right after they
01:06:04.920 made the announcement that as of 2035
01:06:07.520 you're not going to be able to buy an
01:06:08.680 internal combustion engine in California
01:06:10.559 like within a month they had some
01:06:13.000 announcement asking people to not charge
01:06:14.760 their
01:06:16.520 Teslas cuz the grid couldn't handle it
01:06:19.000 well how are you I will terminate the
01:06:20.599 Mandate immediately just a mandate that
01:06:23.000 will be done I would say in my first day
01:06:25.079 maybe days because you know it's let me
01:06:26.960 ask you about nuclear um one one of the
01:06:29.319 things that when I've talked to people
01:06:31.119 that uh have a real understanding of
01:06:32.880 nuclear power they what their position
01:06:35.640 is it's probably the cleanest safest
01:06:37.640 form of electricity that we could
01:06:39.400 generate and that the fears of nuclear
01:06:43.079 power are really about a few disasters
01:06:46.039 the Fukushima through Mile Island um
01:06:49.760 that that these These are old systems
01:06:52.400 and that they could they're much more
01:06:54.119 capable now and they're cap making even
01:06:56.319 better systems but it's a difficult
01:06:58.920 political issue because you think
01:07:01.279 nuclear power you think Chernobyl that's
01:07:03.240 what everybody does they have this
01:07:04.279 connection they had the
01:07:06.079 potential or Fukushima where you're not
01:07:08.079 supposed to enter the land for 3,000
01:07:09.880 years or something it's I think it's
01:07:11.799 worse than that I think that area is
01:07:13.400 like going to be radioactive for
01:07:15.359 probably longer than you could imagine
01:07:17.400 but the the point is they're better at
01:07:19.440 it now right and that they could do it
01:07:21.359 now and you can generate power in a way
01:07:24.079 that you don't have to worry about these
01:07:25.880 one of the most ridiculous things is
01:07:27.799 electric cars being powered by Coal
01:07:30.079 Fired plants it's a ridiculous thing
01:07:32.279 that's what's happening yeah that is
01:07:33.720 what's happening and people want to
01:07:35.279 think they're being green you know but
01:07:37.359 it's well if that you look at the way
01:07:38.799 the battery is made but here's the other
01:07:40.240 thing we don't have well we do actually
01:07:43.079 it's being held you know we have certain
01:07:44.599 areas where we have great raw Earth
01:07:46.839 material and we're not allowed to use it
01:07:48.960 because of the environment and we have
01:07:50.559 areas in California that have incredible
01:07:52.960 raw Earth and they're not allowing and
01:07:55.640 I'm going to open it up I'm going to let
01:07:57.079 them use it but how do you do that how
01:07:59.640 do you do that and protect the
01:08:00.960 environment because the environment is
01:08:02.200 going to be protected you can do it you
01:08:03.640 can make a lake out of it okay we'll put
01:08:05.400 back a lake I mean something nice about
01:08:07.720 Lakes you can do things
01:08:09.680 magnificently you just have to do it
01:08:11.480 carefully respons absolutely you have to
01:08:13.640 do it carefully but the problem you know
01:08:16.120 China has all of those areas most of
01:08:19.080 those areas and yet when they say go
01:08:22.479 electric with the cars China is going to
01:08:24.920 be the one that gives us the cars all of
01:08:26.679 those guys in Detroit are going to be
01:08:28.120 out of business you're going to make
01:08:29.080 your electric cars over there we have a
01:08:30.479 thing called gasoline and we have more
01:08:33.880 oil and gas under our feet than any
01:08:35.839 other Nation you know I had uh in Alaska
01:08:39.120 there's a find it's called anoir I got
01:08:41.799 it approved Reagan couldn't get it
01:08:43.520 nobody could get it I got it all done it
01:08:45.719 was amazing they were getting ready to
01:08:48.080 start drilling the equivalent they think
01:08:51.198 of Saudi Arabia one of the biggest vines
01:08:53.279 in the world it was all set to go and
01:08:55.839 Biden comes in his one of his first
01:08:57.880 orders were we're not going to use it it
01:09:00.880 would have been so good for the we could
01:09:02.679 have supplied all of Asia with oil and
01:09:05.399 gas what was the what was the negative
01:09:06.719 and you talk about money right uh the
01:09:08.799 negative was politically they didn't
01:09:10.198 think it was good for them that's all
01:09:11.640 that's all it was so you don't think
01:09:12.880 that it's environmentally dangerous
01:09:14.439 taking it from way down deep in the
01:09:16.198 earth environmentally would have been
01:09:18.080 fine so it can be done responsibly
01:09:20.238 absolutely otherwi prot the environment
01:09:22.560 well I think windmills okay so they talk
01:09:24.759 about wind I think windmills are really
01:09:27.479 disruptive when you talk about the
01:09:28.839 environment they kill the birds you want
01:09:31.279 to see a bird Cemetery go under a
01:09:33.000 windmill someday that hasn't been
01:09:35.679 cleaned out with all the bird carcasses
01:09:38.679 you it's like massive amounts of bir
01:09:41.080 there a massive iore I I went to a ranch
01:09:44.238 in South Texas we had to drive past this
01:09:46.238 enormous windmill farm and it's gross
01:09:49.120 it's dystopian you're you're looking in
01:09:51.080 the left and the right all he seees
01:09:52.439 these big spinning machines that aren't
01:09:54.679 even that effective at generating
01:09:56.440 electricity corre most expensive form of
01:09:58.640 electricity is a windmill and then they
01:10:01.280 start to rust and rot and you have to
01:10:03.640 then they get abandoned by the people
01:10:05.159 that built them because well you have to
01:10:06.520 get rid of all that material too when
01:10:08.199 you replace those blades now you have a
01:10:10.440 problem because you have dispose right
01:10:12.880 you have to dispose these enormous
01:10:14.600 windmills and how they say you can't
01:10:17.000 bury them so I even question that but
01:10:19.239 I'm not going to get into it but they
01:10:20.800 say you can't bury the blades so you
01:10:22.320 have the blades and you can't bury the
01:10:24.280 blades you can bury the blades it's not
01:10:25.760 going to matter he can bury you'll find
01:10:27.080 areas you can bury but they come up this
01:10:29.120 is what I mean they come up with this
01:10:30.679 but the environmentalist dream is
01:10:32.679 windmills everyone you know what happens
01:10:35.159 to them after 5 years they start to rot
01:10:37.280 after 10 years you have to replace them
01:10:39.480 did you ever look at certain parts of
01:10:41.000 California where they have heavy
01:10:42.640 windmills and they've been abandoned and
01:10:44.920 they're all different manufacturers and
01:10:46.760 all different companies and they all
01:10:48.320 Haven seen that it is the ugliest thing
01:10:50.080 it looks like a graveyard almost a
01:10:52.120 graveyard of windmills uh it's pollution
01:10:55.560 bad it's it is it's it's no different
01:10:58.239 than leaving garbage on the ground how
01:11:00.040 about in New Jersey off the coast of New
01:11:01.880 Jersey they want to build the people are
01:11:04.199 going crazy not to build them but we you
01:11:07.199 have them the whales are washing up on
01:11:08.960 shore right so in 50 years they had one
01:11:12.000 whale come ashore now they had like 18
01:11:14.440 come in the last year what is the what
01:11:17.080 what is happening with the whales I've
01:11:18.400 read about this well they say that the
01:11:19.840 wind drives them crazy you know it's a
01:11:21.679 vibration because you have those you
01:11:23.159 know those things are 50 story building
01:11:25.480 some of them right and they're super
01:11:26.960 sensitive to vibrations they you know
01:11:29.520 the wind is rushing the things are
01:11:31.000 blowing it's a vibration and it makes
01:11:33.360 noise you know what it is I want to be a
01:11:35.760 whale psychiatrist it drives the whales
01:11:39.000 freaking crazy and something happens
01:11:41.800 with them but for whatever reason
01:11:43.920 they're getting washed up unsure and you
01:11:46.000 know and yet the environment ignored by
01:11:48.520 the envir environmentalist they don't
01:11:50.120 talk about it I think there's nothing
01:11:52.000 uglier I see it in Scotland I see it all
01:11:54.199 over the world you have this beautiful
01:11:56.639 Valley it's been there for you know in
01:11:59.239 Civilization thousands of years but
01:12:01.239 millions of years and all of a sudden
01:12:03.320 you have these ugly windmills up would
01:12:05.760 your plan to be replace that with
01:12:07.400 nuclear what Would You Do Well nuclear
01:12:09.040 is better I mean I I think there's a
01:12:10.360 little danger to nuclear but you know we
01:12:11.960 had some really bad nuclear they did one
01:12:14.880 in Alabama they did one in uh I think
01:12:17.480 South
01:12:18.480 Carolina they do them wrong they build
01:12:20.880 these massive things then the
01:12:22.800 environmentalists get in it I don't want
01:12:25.760 to go into a long story because it's too
01:12:27.199 long for the show this show is too
01:12:28.760 valuable to talk about concrete but they
01:12:31.000 have hardened concrete it's number 12
01:12:32.760 concrete it's the hardest it's harder
01:12:34.280 than steel it's incredible they put up a
01:12:36.600 wall and an inspector comes along those
01:12:38.560 nope nope you're a quarter of an inch
01:12:40.840 the wall might be 8 feet wide you're a
01:12:43.840 quarter of an inch too short I'm sorry
01:12:45.480 you got to rip down the wall you got to
01:12:46.960 because it's got to be poured
01:12:47.880 contiguously right you're one4 of an
01:12:51.080 inch I'm sorry I ripped down you can't
01:12:52.880 rip it down this stuff you can't put a
01:12:54.440 hammer through you can't it's it's
01:12:56.400 incredible concrete technology is
01:12:58.920 unbelievable what you know what's
01:13:00.520 happened you think of concrete you think
01:13:02.320 that's an example of overregulation
01:13:04.080 pointless well you have an inspector
01:13:05.920 that comes along and he says take down
01:13:07.320 a$ 25 zillion dollar W these things
01:13:10.480 ended up costing $25
01:13:12.719 billion and they one of them never got
01:13:14.960 opened but here's the story so France
01:13:18.120 does it France is largely nuclear and
01:13:21.560 they build small little compact plants
01:13:24.560 and if they need need more they build
01:13:25.800 the same thing and they hook it up and
01:13:27.560 they hook it up because they get too big
01:13:30.000 and too complex and too expensive and it
01:13:33.520 is very clean they say it's it's Absolut
01:13:37.080 you know my uncle I had a great uncle
01:13:38.920 who was a great genius just like other
01:13:42.159 members of my family but he was a
01:13:45.440 professor at MIT for I think 41 years he
01:13:49.440 was a longest show when I was in the
01:13:51.159 White House the head of MIT Princeton
01:13:53.600 and Harvard came down to me me and the
01:13:56.880 MIT person said I have a book on your
01:13:58.920 uncle Dr John Trump he was a longer
01:14:01.159 serving Professor he was a great genius
01:14:03.120 sir do you know how and he had uh he
01:14:06.040 knew everything about nuclear from math
01:14:08.880 to chemistry to nuclear he knew it and
01:14:12.159 he said someday it's going to be the way
01:14:13.639 to go but the problem is so dangerous in
01:14:16.360 terms of War he
01:14:18.920 said Donald some this was a long time
01:14:22.000 Uncle John Dr John Trump he said someday
01:14:26.120 you'll have a little Satchel at your
01:14:28.480 side and you go into a building and
01:14:30.639 you'll be able to blow up New York City
01:14:32.600 I said Uncle John that'll never happen
01:14:34.639 he's right you know he's right well that
01:14:36.199 was part of problem giving nuclear power
01:14:39.600 to other countries right like that was
01:14:41.520 the problem that happened with India and
01:14:43.360 Pakistan they got nuclear power and then
01:14:46.040 they were able to weaponize it the
01:14:47.719 biggest problem in the world today is
01:14:49.639 not global warming it's nuclear warming
01:14:53.080 and we have idiots that are negotiating
01:14:55.600 for us we have a guy that doesn't make
01:14:58.280 it past 4:00 and it's not because of age
01:15:00.480 you know they ought to I know so many
01:15:02.400 guys in their late 80s and they're
01:15:04.000 better than the I said to one guy the
01:15:05.440 other day I think you're smarter than
01:15:06.600 you were 25 years ago I've known him a
01:15:08.199 long time he's 89 years old he's sharp
01:15:11.360 as I mean he's
01:15:12.960 great Biden gives people a bad name
01:15:15.960 because that's not an old that's not an
01:15:18.159 age I think they say it because I'm
01:15:19.520 three or four years younger you know I
01:15:21.040 think that's why they say it they say
01:15:22.239 his age it's not his age he he's got a
01:15:24.440 problem major brain surgeries he did he
01:15:27.239 did those are not good operations and do
01:15:30.080 you see what he did today he went runed
01:15:32.719 towards the camera and made some apology
01:15:34.679 to na Native Americans and uh that he
01:15:37.440 said that's why he's headed out west
01:15:39.000 like he's off the reservation so to
01:15:41.639 speak for lack of a better term you know
01:15:44.040 it's interesting because during the
01:15:46.080 debate I was uh looking over I'm saying
01:15:49.960 this is strange just sort of like
01:15:51.840 strange things were happening yeah but
01:15:54.280 he couldn't keep it together but do you
01:15:55.520 think they knew he couldn't keep it
01:15:56.800 together do you think that they wanted
01:15:58.880 is that why like historically that
01:16:00.560 debate was earlier than they've been in
01:16:02.480 the past right I think they wanted to
01:16:05.239 get well there's a lot of theories a lot
01:16:06.760 of people said do the debate now and
01:16:08.840 we'll get them out right I think that
01:16:11.000 maybe could be well that is what
01:16:12.960 happened it's they also said do the
01:16:15.880 debate now and get it over with right uh
01:16:18.639 I don't think anybody thought he was
01:16:19.960 going to get out really I don't didn't
01:16:21.639 make any sense the debate the debate got
01:16:23.560 him out but but I think it's very unfair
01:16:25.560 look you have a bad debate his numbers
01:16:28.320 went down but I think she's not doing
01:16:30.880 very well right now and I think she
01:16:32.960 looks why want I get to that too because
01:16:35.120 it's hard to know like the whole poll
01:16:37.360 thing is very bizarre for most people
01:16:39.199 because most people don't answer polls
01:16:40.920 so they read the polls they're like
01:16:43.080 never I did hang up I was never called
01:16:45.239 by a PO if I did I wouldn't answer I'm
01:16:46.800 busy you know how polls are done oh I'm
01:16:49.040 going to get myself in trouble but so I
01:16:51.840 really don't believe too much in him so
01:16:54.480 well 2016 taught a lot of people about
01:16:56.440 the ineffective well they were very
01:16:57.920 ineffective because I thought I was
01:16:59.120 doing well I'd go to a place and I'd
01:17:01.000 have 30 40,000 people Hillary would go
01:17:03.760 they have 500 people and they tell me
01:17:05.480 I'm going to lose I said why am I going
01:17:07.080 to lose I had 40,000 people so she had
01:17:09.040 200 people but you know I have a theory
01:17:11.800 these pollsters they charge you a lot of
01:17:13.199 money too you know they charge you a
01:17:14.440 half a million bucks to do some stupid
01:17:16.120 poll and they interview like 251 people
01:17:19.480 I don't think they interview him in many
01:17:21.080 cases I don't want to get myself in too
01:17:22.600 much trouble think no I think
01:17:24.639 they sit there they make a deal they get
01:17:26.280 a half a million bucks and they say
01:17:28.480 Trump's leading 51 to 49 they announce
01:17:31.040 it and everybody says oh do you
01:17:33.320 understand I I don't think they I think
01:17:36.719 in a lot look I'm a very common sense
01:17:39.760 person I think that they probably don't
01:17:42.800 always Paul some of them probably never
01:17:45.639 pa uh what's the difference between 49
01:17:49.280 to 51 and 47 and a half well it's also a
01:17:52.920 tiny percentage of the population I
01:17:55.120 don't think it's representative of the
01:17:56.960 overall population I just don't think I
01:17:58.760 don't know of one person in my whole
01:18:00.760 life that ever got called by a puler
01:18:02.719 exactly that's my point so here's here's
01:18:06.440 my question but I shouldn't say that
01:18:07.920 because I'm doing very you know really
01:18:09.400 well in the polls but I think that so
01:18:11.239 this week I happen to believe in a verse
01:18:13.080 I only believe they're good no I like
01:18:16.320 them this month but no I I honestly
01:18:18.440 believe that this is probably a lot of
01:18:19.920 fraud I had a poll Washington Post ABC
01:18:22.679 in the Hillary thing on Wisconsin they
01:18:25.239 had me down 17 points the day before the
01:18:28.239 election I knew it was wrong because I
01:18:30.600 had a rally I had 29,000 people at a
01:18:32.800 racetrack and it was like Zer degrees
01:18:35.159 Wisconsin and they had me down 17 points
01:18:38.520 in other words you had no chance and I
01:18:40.840 won and I called up my pulsers good guy
01:18:44.080 good good guy and I I believe he's
01:18:46.320 legitimate and you know some of them are
01:18:48.360 some of them are I said tell me why did
01:18:51.040 they have me down so much I mean
01:18:53.440 nobody's going to believe him next time
01:18:55.280 they said they don't care when you're
01:18:57.120 down 17 points people are going to stay
01:18:59.639 home they're not going to vote because
01:19:01.360 they're going to say I love Trump but
01:19:02.600 I'm not going to waste my time it's cold
01:19:04.040 out I said but what do they make at four
01:19:06.320 or five he said at 4 or5 they're going
01:19:08.679 to go and vote at 17 they're not going
01:19:10.920 to go think of it I was s this is a
01:19:13.199 Washington Post ABC poll I was down 17
01:19:16.639 points in Wisconsin and I
01:19:18.840 won it's crooked stuff there's a lot of
01:19:21.800 crooked stuff and I wanted to talk about
01:19:23.159 that too because one of the things that
01:19:25.320 people um talk about with you is uh the
01:19:28.840 denial of the results and I think JD
01:19:31.360 Vance did a brilliant job the other day
01:19:32.880 when he was being interviewed uh and
01:19:34.679 they they asked him did Trump lose the
01:19:36.600 2020 election and he turned it around
01:19:38.960 and said was there legitimate election
01:19:42.080 interference in suppressing the hunter
01:19:44.280 Biden laptop story on social media and
01:19:48.320 was that a concerted effort well they
01:19:50.760 say make 10-point difference and I lost
01:19:52.760 by one one uh
01:19:55.199 tenth of a point is they say it was
01:19:57.600 22,000 votes but look it was much more
01:20:00.679 than that and I appreciate jdan saying
01:20:02.520 that and by the way I think he was a
01:20:03.920 great pick do you like JD as a I like
01:20:06.719 him a lot you're allowed to say that no
01:20:08.679 I do I like him a lot I think he's
01:20:10.400 brilliant guy and I think his ability to
01:20:13.040 talk like a normal human being he did
01:20:15.159 you did my friend Theo Von's podcast and
01:20:17.159 he just did it how did he do with he did
01:20:18.880 great and it he just talks like a normal
01:20:21.280 human being do is that why you called me
01:20:23.080 to do this no no
01:20:25.400 I was uh once they shot you I was like
01:20:27.960 he's got to come in here it's all about
01:20:29.760 timing it's all about the timing I think
01:20:32.080 timing's perfect do you even have a scar
01:20:33.480 on your ear you got anything on there I
01:20:34.960 do what me say say what you got so right
01:20:37.639 over here it's a tiny little Mark it
01:20:41.400 zied right there it's it healed up
01:20:44.280 pretty good well it's pretty
01:20:45.679 good yeah little it's not like uh some
01:20:48.239 of the wrestlers some of the UFC
01:20:50.440 fighters you didn't get no no it got it
01:20:53.800 was sort of like a top shot mhm the
01:20:55.920 point of the bullet was a little of the
01:20:57.600 but you see the the the thing's taken
01:20:59.679 off a little bit but uh it makes me a
01:21:03.199 tougher guy you know the fighters you
01:21:05.120 know the fighters love their you know Bo
01:21:07.280 nickel is a great fighter how's he going
01:21:09.360 to do I think he's Terri great he's a
01:21:11.000 fantastic he was almost like undefeated
01:21:12.800 in college he still yeah he's a
01:21:14.199 fantastic wrestler and one of the one of
01:21:15.960 the best Mixed Martial when is he
01:21:17.239 fighting again he's fighting in Mass
01:21:18.639 Square Garden in November oh that's
01:21:21.239 going to be an after the election yep so
01:21:23.880 I'll either go as president or I'll be
01:21:25.719 depressed and I won't bother I really
01:21:28.960 yeah I think they're having a fight
01:21:30.000 right now one of the things that was
01:21:31.199 fascinating also was uh the denial of
01:21:34.040 the election results is is a pretty
01:21:36.159 common thing Hillary Clinton famously
01:21:38.520 denied that she called you an
01:21:40.040 illegitimate president and she said that
01:21:41.639 Russia put you in place even though she
01:21:43.120 conceited yes you know she Conceited the
01:21:45.360 night of the election CU she was beaten
01:21:47.639 yes and it was a thing that was pretty
01:21:50.400 common for people especially Democrats
01:21:52.719 to deny the elections
01:21:55.320 there's been many of them the Bush
01:21:56.639 Administration the you know the dangling
01:21:59.159 Chads all that all that stuff well look
01:22:01.080 at these guys in Congress all these SAS
01:22:03.159 bags in Congress that are Democrats
01:22:04.880 they're still denying
01:22:06.520 2016 but now they don't so much because
01:22:09.239 you know they try and pin it on me you
01:22:10.960 don't hear them say here's my they
01:22:12.480 denied it right up until the end my
01:22:13.960 point is this idea of election fraud is
01:22:17.560 a forbidden topic and you get labeled an
01:22:20.560 election deny it's like being labeled an
01:22:22.600 antivaxer if you question some of the
01:22:24.679 health consequences that people have had
01:22:26.679 from the 19 shots oh my God you're anti
01:22:29.040 you're an antivaxer if you say and what
01:22:32.040 I say publicly and I've said this a lot
01:22:34.719 it's not
01:22:35.800 0% so if you ask me what is the amount
01:22:38.360 of election fraud in this country is it
01:22:40.239 0% no one thinks it's 0% I've never met
01:22:43.840 one person not a a super liberal
01:22:47.239 Progressive far left person or a a
01:22:50.080 right-wing conservative not one person
01:22:52.199 thinks it's 0% they think when you have
01:22:54.560 human beings and also you have a lot of
01:22:57.719 weirdness that was going on during the
01:22:59.920 2020 elections particularly with mail
01:23:02.360 and ballots and you had legislators that
01:23:05.320 had to approve and they didn't approve
01:23:07.239 and they went out and did it anyway and
01:23:09.560 you had ballot you had old-fashioned
01:23:11.880 ballot screwing I mean you had the you
01:23:14.760 have people going up and dropping in
01:23:16.560 phony votes you had unsigned ballots etc
01:23:19.040 etc there's certain people that think
01:23:20.600 they have and there's the rhetoric is
01:23:22.560 also that you're Hitler and that in
01:23:24.960 order to stop Hitler you have to do
01:23:26.960 whatever it Tak that was okay yeah yeah
01:23:28.840 and this is I mean you're hearing this
01:23:30.239 now K compared you to said Your Love of
01:23:32.560 Hitler yesterday it's you know KLA is a
01:23:35.719 very low IQ person she's a very low IQ
01:23:38.719 you know I'm for taking tests too I
01:23:41.120 think anybody that runs for president
01:23:42.960 should take they should give him test
01:23:44.760 and it's not an age thing it's not based
01:23:46.719 if you look back on History 70s and 80s
01:23:49.120 your greatest some of your greatest
01:23:50.719 leaders in the world world history
01:23:52.600 longtime world history they were in
01:23:55.199 their 70s and their 80s but I think you
01:23:57.880 should take cognitive tests I think
01:23:59.560 everybody they say it's
01:24:01.639 unconstitutional but I think ridiculous
01:24:03.600 I think Comm should have a test because
01:24:05.280 there's something missing there's
01:24:06.480 something wrong with her well I think
01:24:07.880 it's pressure I think the pressure and
01:24:09.719 the scrutiny you've been a celebrity for
01:24:11.400 a long time and you understand what this
01:24:12.920 is like but for someone who's in her
01:24:15.120 late 40s who becomes the vice president
01:24:17.679 who runs for president becomes the vice
01:24:19.280 president and then all of a sudden the
01:24:21.280 weight of the world is on your shoulders
01:24:22.639 and there's all these people paying a
01:24:24.120 lot lot of people clam up but you either
01:24:26.280 have it you don't correct look this is
01:24:29.159 an interview you've we've covered a lot
01:24:30.920 of territory right and and you know it's
01:24:33.000 fine I don't care I want to I think it's
01:24:35.719 much more interesting she to do an
01:24:38.719 interview with uh Al Anderson
01:24:42.119 Cooper a softball crazy softball
01:24:45.080 interview she took two days off and she
01:24:47.520 studied and studied all day long and
01:24:49.280 then she comes out with a result that
01:24:50.639 was a real embarrassment that was a
01:24:52.440 really bad interview she couldn't answer
01:24:54.000 a question question and every question
01:24:56.199 is not answered I mean like what would
01:24:58.600 you do your first day in office okay
01:25:01.119 I'll build a wall I won't build the wall
01:25:03.119 there's a hundred things you can say
01:25:04.520 just say anything right uh there's
01:25:07.000 something off with her well I also we're
01:25:09.600 dealing Jo we're dealing with the
01:25:10.960 smartest people they hate when I say you
01:25:13.080 know when the Pres when I call President
01:25:14.639 she they said he called president she
01:25:17.000 brilliant well he's a brilliant guy he
01:25:18.400 controls 1.4 billion people with an iron
01:25:20.639 fist I mean he's a brilliant guy whether
01:25:22.000 you like it or not and they go crazy
01:25:25.360 right it doesn't mean he's not evil or
01:25:26.960 it doesn't mean he's not yeah of course
01:25:28.639 dangerous but but actually we have evil
01:25:31.960 people in our country yes if you have a
01:25:33.800 smart president he can deal with Russia
01:25:35.679 he can deal with all of it I had a i
01:25:38.199 Russia would have never gotone into
01:25:39.719 Ukraine if I were president how would
01:25:41.520 you have stopped it he automatic two
01:25:43.960 things I told him I said Vladimir you're
01:25:46.560 not going in I used to talk to him all
01:25:48.719 the time you're not going in I can't
01:25:51.560 tell you what I told him because I think
01:25:53.719 it would be appropriate but someday
01:25:55.800 he'll tell you but he would have never
01:25:57.040 gone in but you know why else he
01:25:58.280 wouldn't have gone in oil prices at $40
01:26:00.400 a barrel wouldn't have allowed him
01:26:02.679 wouldn't have given him the money to
01:26:04.840 prosecute that war wouldn't have given
01:26:06.560 him the money I said it with President I
01:26:09.840 was with President she I said it was
01:26:11.560 almost the same conversation with
01:26:14.920 Vladimir was
01:26:16.600 Moscow with President she it was Beijing
01:26:20.880 it was almost the exact same
01:26:22.679 conversation I said don't do it he would
01:26:24.760 have never done it the day I left they
01:26:26.880 flew 28 bombers over the middle of
01:26:29.600 Taiwan 28 bombers and it's the apple of
01:26:33.199 his eye and the same thing with Russia
01:26:35.600 it's the Apple Ukraine is the apple of
01:26:37.600 his eye I used to talk to him I had a
01:26:39.199 very good relationship with him he
01:26:41.320 wouldn't have done it he would have
01:26:42.639 never done it but he also wouldn't have
01:26:44.800 done it because of the you know one of
01:26:46.520 the reasons that what happened is number
01:26:49.040 one he doesn't respect Biden at all not
01:26:51.560 even a little bit and who the hell would
01:26:53.880 but he doesn't respect him but when he
01:26:55.639 saw what happened in Afghanistan how
01:26:57.800 horribly that was handled number one you
01:27:00.639 take the soldiers out last not first
01:27:02.480 okay that was their big mistake and we
01:27:04.560 had that thing charted out and they
01:27:06.000 weren't obeying us they weren't uh Abdul
01:27:09.360 is the head of the Taliban boom boom he
01:27:11.840 had to do all these things some he
01:27:13.679 didn't do I said nope you're not do you
01:27:15.880 got to do them all this guy took he
01:27:18.840 immediately took all he left the
01:27:20.760 equipment behind 13 soldiers dead but he
01:27:23.400 took everybody out he took his soldiers
01:27:25.760 out before a child would know that's
01:27:28.760 where Millie was so stupid he was such a
01:27:30.560 stupid guy
01:27:32.199 Millie okay those generals should have
01:27:34.639 all been fired the Afghan the people
01:27:37.360 that were involved with Afghanistan
01:27:39.960 should have all been fired then they'd
01:27:41.480 be writing books about him how stupid he
01:27:43.360 was and bad he was but you take your
01:27:46.520 soldiers out last I had a a big rally
01:27:49.920 and I saw a child in the front
01:27:52.040 row uh about a year and a half ago and I
01:27:54.800 called the child up I said do you mind
01:27:56.400 if I borrow your child oh yes please and
01:27:59.239 they came up kids five years I gave them
01:28:01.360 quick details you know I said we want to
01:28:03.119 get out of this place and we have this
01:28:05.480 and we have this and we have the
01:28:06.560 equipment I gave him a little thing I
01:28:08.159 said do you take your soldiers out first
01:28:11.000 or last after everything's done you take
01:28:14.119 them out last sir a child would know
01:28:17.000 that we took our soldiers out first what
01:28:19.719 was your and we left a bag room well not
01:28:23.199 only that we left billions of dollars
01:28:25.480 worth of equipment and military vehicles
01:28:27.600 that they use for parades now best the
01:28:29.719 best equipment yeah to embarrass us the
01:28:31.679 best equipment in the world the Taliban
01:28:34.199 parade where there got tanks rolling
01:28:36.040 down the streets and Blackhawks flying
01:28:37.679 is the craziest thing I've ever seen
01:28:39.440 fact that we left all Best Equipment in
01:28:41.800 the World Behind what would you have
01:28:44.199 done differently well number one we
01:28:46.679 would have taken it out just so go back
01:28:48.840 a little bit further I had a couple of
01:28:50.960 conversations with Abdul and from the
01:28:53.760 time had those conversations cuz they
01:28:55.880 were shooting our soldiers you know with
01:28:57.360 the sniper stuff they were shoot they
01:28:59.639 were shooting a lot of them they were
01:29:00.639 shooting a lot with Obama much less with
01:29:02.920 me but they were shooting him and I said
01:29:05.560 get this guy on the phone the Press went
01:29:07.920 nuts when they heard this I had a great
01:29:10.360 conversation with it was a tough
01:29:12.159 conversation 18 months later there
01:29:14.400 wasn't one soldier that was ever shot at
01:29:17.159 and even Biden admitted it in a moment
01:29:19.159 of stupidity cuz he shouldn't admit it
01:29:20.800 his people went nuts he said yeah well I
01:29:23.159 will admit no Soldier we had we didn't
01:29:25.480 have a soldier killed in 18 months in
01:29:29.040 Afghanistan not one soldier was killed
01:29:31.679 because he understood what was going to
01:29:34.159 happen if that happened I didn't have
01:29:36.679 one so then when I left after having
01:29:39.719 gotten more votes than any sitting
01:29:41.760 president in the history of the country
01:29:43.760 and much more votes than he got in 2016
01:29:46.679 when I
01:29:47.719 left they started shooting our soldiers
01:29:51.040 but more importantly what they did is
01:29:53.800 they did that whole thing with you know
01:29:55.840 leaving he shouldn't have left number
01:29:57.639 one should have left from bogram because
01:29:59.560 bogram is this massive base it's got
01:30:02.320 tremendous acreage around it tremendous
01:30:04.320 it's a very big it was built many years
01:30:06.040 ago and part of the reason you wouldn't
01:30:08.280 have taken that is because it goes to
01:30:10.040 China one hour from where China makes
01:30:12.760 its nuclear missiles you should have
01:30:15.320 never left bogram number one they should
01:30:18.600 have left from bogram they should have
01:30:21.520 left last they should have got you know
01:30:23.480 we have Americans that are still there
01:30:25.679 they should have taken all their
01:30:26.920 equipment out everything should every
01:30:28.840 plane every screw should have been taken
01:30:30.840 out every tent and I said that that's
01:30:33.600 when I realized that Millie was a dummy
01:30:35.320 I said we're leaving but I want to get
01:30:38.040 everything out sirar it's cheaper to
01:30:39.719 leave it I said what do you mean cheaper
01:30:42.280 to leave it yeah he said it's cheaper to
01:30:43.480 leave it that was cheaper cheaper he
01:30:45.159 said it's cheaper sir not more dangerous
01:30:48.360 he just said cheaper I said I want every
01:30:50.880 plane I want every tank I want the
01:30:52.880 goggles they night goggles they have all
01:30:55.280 this stuff that these guys now have he
01:30:57.440 said sir it's cheaper to get out and
01:30:59.679 leave it I said so you think it's
01:31:01.960 cheaper to leave a $150 million brand
01:31:04.400 new airplane in there than it is to fly
01:31:07.440 it out with a tank of jet fuel and put
01:31:09.440 it in Pakistan or just fly it directly
01:31:12.239 back it's cheaper to live I said this
01:31:14.960 guy's nuts I'm telling you he was so
01:31:17.239 stupid he was so unwise he was like an
01:31:19.880 unwise man and there were a number of
01:31:22.600 them but I defeated Isis with the
01:31:25.520 greatest generals I had a guy who was so
01:31:28.320 great I flew to Iraq and I met the real
01:31:33.280 generals not these idiots that we deal
01:31:35.679 with and we knocked out you know I
01:31:38.960 defeated 100% of the Isis caliphate they
01:31:42.080 said it would take five years I did it
01:31:43.639 in a matter of a few literally a few
01:31:47.040 weeks and we hit them hard and he said
01:31:50.000 so we're going to hit him here we're
01:31:51.159 going to hit him there we're going to
01:31:52.159 hit him here there and I said this guy's
01:31:55.040 great I like this guy I was told it
01:31:57.239 would take five years that's why I went
01:32:00.040 I said how could it take five years we
01:32:01.639 have brand new Fighters we have the best
01:32:03.400 planes the best weapons the best guns
01:32:05.520 the best bombs how could it possibly
01:32:07.679 take that long and I flew to um I flew
01:32:12.199 and left at 3:00 in the morning nobody
01:32:15.159 knew I was going I got on Air Force One
01:32:17.119 and we started
01:32:18.320 flying and when we reached about half an
01:32:21.199 hour away from Iraq that was where the
01:32:23.639 air Port was big
01:32:25.080 airport uh about a half an hour away
01:32:27.840 they said sir I'm sorry you'll have to
01:32:29.320 turn off all your lights why we're
01:32:31.600 getting close to our site our land I
01:32:34.000 said you mean we spent 8 trillion do and
01:32:36.639 we can't leave the lights think of this
01:32:39.080 20 years $8 trillion and we can't leave
01:32:41.440 the lights on in a
01:32:43.000 plane I said that's okay turn the lights
01:32:45.480 on I'm not going to fight him that's one
01:32:47.239 this is because it's too dangerous yeah
01:32:48.679 too dangerous cuz they see the light up
01:32:50.040 in the air they'll shoot at it you know
01:32:52.320 so uh I said said turn the lights off
01:32:55.280 then they said sir we're going to also
01:32:56.440 pull your shades of that's okay said
01:32:57.920 that's okay the plane was Pitch Black
01:33:00.360 all the lights outside you know the
01:33:01.800 blinking they go the blinking Reds they
01:33:03.800 were all turned off and I like to sit
01:33:06.600 with Pilots a lot of times and these
01:33:08.159 guys are specimens I always say they're
01:33:11.199 better looking than Tom Cruz okay and
01:33:15.119 they're even taller like perfect
01:33:17.920 specimens these guys like for a fighter
01:33:20.400 you know you have some guys that are
01:33:21.600 perfect specimens these and you know
01:33:23.960 they picked they picked the best pilots
01:33:25.719 in the Air Force United States Air Force
01:33:27.400 to fly Air Force One and I get up there
01:33:31.960 and I'm sitting and and I'm feeling my
01:33:34.360 way up you know it's up high 7:47 so you

01:33:38.040 my way up there wasn't a light in the
01:33:40.360 plan I'm saying can you imagine we spent
01:33:43.520 trillions of dollars and we're trying to
01:33:46.159 fly in blind but I got into the plane
01:33:49.280 the cockpit is dark black little tiny
01:33:52.040 light you could see the pilot
01:33:54.239 a perfect looking human being his
01:33:56.199 co-pilot everybody was perfect they were
01:33:57.920 all like movie stars you know it's like
01:33:59.679 I could have cast a movie with these
01:34:01.080 guys and nobody would believe it because

01:35:39.000 between the equipment and it's genius
01:35:41.400 it's pure it was so dark you couldn't
01:35:44.080 see a thing there was no Runway you
01:35:46.520 wouldn't know where the hell you you're
01:35:47.920 in the middle of a desert and then I got
01:35:50.320 out of the plane I said thank you
01:35:51.920 Captain that's a great job and then I
01:35:53.920 get out of the plane and I'm going down
01:35:56.280 and I see a general and another General
01:35:59.960 and I see a staff sergeant a drill
01:36:01.840 sergeant and are various guys all
01:36:04.639 Central Casting Central
01:36:07.800 Casting they said sir would you like to
01:36:10.000 rest I said I don't want to rest I want
01:36:11.679 to figure out what the hell are we doing
01:36:13.239 with Isis I'm hearing we we can't it's
01:36:15.000 going to take years no sir we can do it
01:36:18.040 very quickly sir and anyway we go into
01:36:20.800 the room we go I mean Biden would have
01:36:23.199 taken nap for 4 days and then left
01:36:25.080 without a meeting so we go into the room
01:36:27.600 and these they have these guys I say how
01:36:30.239 long can you do it how long we can do it
01:36:32.280 in a couple of weeks sir I said wait a
01:36:34.480 minute they told me five years we can do
01:36:36.840 it in I don't he gave me a number like
01:36:39.719 like just like in no time I said why
01:36:43.320 haven't you done it because the orders
01:36:46.159 came in from Washington sir and they
01:36:47.920 would come here and tell us what to do
01:36:49.600 don't you challenge us we're not allowed
01:36:51.679 to do that sir that's not the military
01:36:53.760 way they tell us what to do and we have
01:36:55.440 to respect them I just so do you think
01:36:57.480 that it was incompetence why they didn't
01:37:00.119 go after Isis I think it's a bad system
01:37:02.159 you know when Mattis goes there or when
01:37:03.920 Millie goes there who's stupid and they
01:37:05.920 tell these guys that are actually smart
01:37:07.840 what to do and the guys that are smart
01:37:10.360 are saying we don't like what they're
01:37:11.800 doing but they're not allowed to sort of
01:37:13.840 counteract plus the guys that went there
01:37:15.920 are arrogant you know they're arrogant
01:37:17.840 fools they're like stupid fools uh the
01:37:20.600 way they pulled out of uh you know the
01:37:22.800 way they as an example the way they
01:37:25.040 pulled out of Afghanistan with the
01:37:26.679 people falling off the planes the it was
01:37:29.199 so it was it was worse than Vietnam with
01:37:31.560 the helicopters fall it was so bad there
01:37:34.679 was no reason for it anyway so we
01:37:37.040 knocked them out and I mean we have
01:37:39.800 great military we have great people but
01:37:42.719 not the television guys and I rebuilt
01:37:45.239 the military and then they gave a chunk
01:37:47.119 of it now I have to tell as much as it
01:37:49.159 is it's a tiny little piece believe it
01:37:51.520 or not we have an believe I rebuilt the
01:37:54.719 military I rebuilt our nuclear and in a
01:37:57.920 way I hated to redo it but I got to
01:38:00.040 realize how powerful that nuclear is
01:38:03.400 Joe one bomb Israel is gone but forget
01:38:08.040 one bomb could take out the entire East
01:38:10.159 Coast it's so bad and I watch these poor
01:38:13.599 fools talking about our oceans will rise
01:38:17.080 1 18 of an inch over the next 500 years
01:38:19.760 I mean we have people we have countries
01:38:22.960 right now you five countries and don't
01:38:25.440 underestimate North North if you take a
01:38:28.920 look at North Korea their new I was
01:38:31.280 there I mean I was with Kim I had a
01:38:33.400 great Rel I got along great with him you
01:38:35.159 know the president he got along that's a
01:38:37.080 good thing it's not a bad thing it's a
01:38:38.480 great thing Obama thought we were going
01:38:40.880 to go to war with North Korea when I met
01:38:43.159 with Obama just prior to the Takeover
01:38:45.000 you know you meet you have it's a sort
01:38:46.440 of a ceremonial meeting but it lasted a
01:38:49.320 long time a lot longer than it was
01:38:50.760 supposed to last I said what's the
01:38:52.080 biggest problem he said North Korea
01:38:55.040 by the time I finished I was we we had
01:38:57.639 no problem with North Korea we were
01:38:59.280 really it was a little tough at the
01:39:00.920 beginning remember MH he said uh I have
01:39:04.199 a red button on my desk I said I have a
01:39:06.639 red button also but mine's bigger than
01:39:09.040 yours and mine works I liked how you
01:39:10.719 called them little rocket man I said I
01:39:12.639 said yeah little rocket I said little
01:39:14.440 rocket man you're going to burn in hell
01:39:16.040 and it was a rough yeah oh so rough that
01:39:19.239 people were worried this is crazy and
01:39:21.159 then one day I got a call sort of like a
01:39:23.440 fight I got a call you know you ever see
01:39:26.000 what they pounding P then all of a
01:39:27.520 sudden but I got a call and it was from
01:39:30.800 him meaning his people they wanted to
01:39:32.880 meet they wouldn't meet Obama he tried
01:39:35.960 to meet they wouldn't even talk to him
01:39:37.360 about it and I think he expected to go
01:39:40.159 to war I actually do I believe he
01:39:41.880 expected to go and we check their
01:39:44.199 nuclear stock po it is substantial I
01:39:46.599 mean it's that's I said do you do
01:39:48.400 anything I got to know him very well I
01:39:50.520 got to know him better than anybody
01:39:52.679 anybody
01:39:54.080 and I said do you ever do anything else
01:39:55.639 why don't you go take it easy and relax
01:39:57.639 go to the beach you have beautiful beach
01:40:00.040 nice beach front property you know
01:40:01.840 kiddingly I said you're always building
01:40:03.840 nuclear just relax you don't have to do
01:40:06.280 it let's build some condos on your
01:40:08.360 Shoreline they actually have gorgeous
01:40:09.960 stuff and he said uh I just have to do
01:40:13.320 it because I need it for my safety ET
01:40:15.199 said I got to know him very well we had
01:40:17.360 no problem with him if you have a smart
01:40:19.599 problem if you have a smart really the
01:40:22.239 right president the smart president
01:40:24.639 you're not going to have a problem and I
01:40:26.400 say it to people we have a bigger
01:40:28.520 problem in my opinion with the Enemy
01:40:30.920 from within and it drives them crazy
01:40:32.719 when I use that term but we have an
01:40:34.800 enemy from within we have people that
01:40:36.639 are really bad people that I really
01:40:39.719 think want to make this country
01:40:41.599 unsuccessful when you look at what's
01:40:43.520 happening at our border Joe when you
01:40:45.040 have people coming in that when when
01:40:47.400 other countries are allowed to empty
01:40:49.320 their prisons into our country with
01:40:51.679 murderers we had
01:40:53.760 ,99 murderers dropped in our country
01:40:56.960 over the last three years and 15,000
01:40:59.800 rapists convicted rapists yeah drug
01:41:03.080 dealers drug lords that's just the ones
01:41:05.560 that have been correct people from
01:41:08.639 mental institutions what do you think
01:41:10.440 this hundred hundreds of thousands of
01:41:13.960 major criminals tougher and worse than
01:41:17.360 anybody we have these we're seeing the
01:41:19.119 consequences of it in San Antonio
01:41:20.599 they've taken over apartment buildings
01:41:22.040 in Aurora Colorado take apartment
01:41:24.080 buildings these Venezuelan G just the
01:41:26.159 beginning what what do you think the
01:41:28.639 strategy is you know one of the things
01:41:30.960 that they've said is that you uh stopped
01:41:33.840 a bill from being passed but didn't that
01:41:37.360 bill also include amnesty for the people
01:41:39.840 that are already here Jo this is years
01:41:41.960 after the fact the damage was already
01:41:44.679 done but what was the bill was the it
01:41:47.639 allowed 2 million people and they were
01:41:49.840 going to get amnesty it was a horrible
01:41:52.360 bill it didn't protect us at all but we
01:41:55.119 should just tell people what the
01:41:56.199 strategy is so one of the things that's
01:41:58.159 been their strategy one of the things
01:41:59.719 that's been very clear is that they've
01:42:01.719 moved a large percentage of these
01:42:04.560 migrants they're coming across the
01:42:05.719 border illegally they've moved them to
01:42:08.920 swing States like this is what's going
01:42:11.400 on with Springfield Ohio right they're
01:42:12.800 in swing States well that's not a swing
01:42:14.599 state I'm going to win Ohio by a lot so
01:42:16.800 that's not a but it's called Springfield
01:42:18.840 Ohio to be exact and yeah Springfield
01:42:21.400 Ohio is this very nice community of
01:42:25.000 52,000 people that just had
01:42:29.400 32,000 migrants that don't speak the
01:42:31.840 language dropped into their Community
01:42:35.000 you can't get into a hospital you can't
01:42:36.960 get into a school it's gone from a
01:42:39.360 beautiful little place to a horror show
01:42:42.880 and the mayor is a nice guy and the
01:42:44.679 mayor says we're looking for
01:42:47.159 interpreters I said no you've got to
01:42:49.760 remove them and bring them back to their
01:42:51.360 country mostly Haitians in this cas is
01:42:54.040 but they speak no they speak no language
01:42:56.119 they speak no no English mean in fact
01:42:58.880 even the language they do speak it's I
01:43:00.639 mean they can't get interpreters they
01:43:02.040 can't do anything and the mayor's trying
01:43:03.760 to be politically correct they're all
01:43:05.040 trying to be in Aurora Colorado you have
01:43:08.599 the the worst probably the worst gang
01:43:11.040 MS-13 might even be you know those two
01:43:13.440 are the worst gangs these are Venezuela
01:43:15.159 gangs they have taken over apartment
01:43:18.440 complexes and they're going to want to
01:43:19.880 take over the whole thing and you have a
01:43:21.880 weak Governor pathetic Governor uh who's
01:43:24.920 a radical left Democrat he doesn't know
01:43:27.239 what the hell to do but you have it in
01:43:29.440 many other communities but they don't
01:43:30.679 like to talk about it because it's you
01:43:32.080 know it's bad for the community to talk
01:43:33.800 about it these people have been LED in
01:43:36.880 here by this imbecile she's and I mean
01:43:40.960 it she's a low IQ person low IQ right
01:43:45.000 but it's also it's obviously not just
01:43:46.920 her there's there's a strategy that's
01:43:49.080 involved in letting these people she was
01:43:50.360 in charge of the Border well she's in
01:43:51.840 charge of the Border but they also they
01:43:53.560 they utilize that app the app that used
01:43:56.320 to be used it used to be used I think
01:43:58.280 essentially wasn't it for shipping
01:44:00.159 wasn't it when people were this country
01:44:01.800 it was used for shipping and now it's
01:44:03.360 used to deal with the cartels the cartel
01:44:06.880 heads of the cartel rich people by the
01:44:08.880 way these are loaded these people have
01:44:10.760 so much money they would call up think
01:44:13.360 of this they call up the app and the app
01:44:16.520 tells them where they should take their
01:44:19.159 load of illegal migrants from the Congo
01:44:23.119 you know we have a lot from the Congo
01:44:24.599 prisons in the
01:44:26.000 Congo um I made a little bit of a
01:44:28.800 sarcastic joke a man named Dana White
01:44:30.960 who you love who I love I assume you
01:44:32.800 love I love that dude I think he's in a
01:44:35.360 class by he's probably the reason why
01:44:37.239 you're
01:44:38.400 here I I I don't know maybe he's one of
01:44:41.560 the big ones he is the greatest guy you
01:44:44.080 know I always say every nobody's
01:44:46.119 indispensable you know everybody can be
01:44:48.159 replaced maybe you can't be you might
01:44:50.000 not be but they know what truly I don't
01:44:52.719 think you know the things they sold it
01:44:54.719 for 4 billion I said what a hell who the
01:44:57.719 hell is going to pay 4
01:44:59.560 billion and they made like a great deal
01:45:02.520 I
01:45:03.360 mean take him out I think it's all every
01:45:05.880 no he's the
01:45:07.199 best greatest guy he spoke at my at the
01:45:10.360 whole thing with you know I had just
01:45:11.840 been shot and he got up and he spoke so
01:45:14.639 better than anybody I mean who would be
01:45:16.880 better to introduce you I asked of all
01:45:19.000 the people and I know the biggest people
01:45:20.760 in the world and they all would have
01:45:22.000 loved to have done it I said Dana would
01:45:23.880 you do it you it was interesting he was
01:45:26.320 away and he said to the people that you
01:45:28.960 know one of my guys called said I won't
01:45:31.760 be able to do it I'm she I just left
01:45:33.560 with my wife and family I won't I said
01:45:36.520 he said no yeah I was a little surprised
01:45:38.320 even though I knew he was very far away
01:45:39.760 he was in someplace some you know and
01:45:41.800 and he deserved it with his family you
01:45:43.400 know the whole thing and then I said all
01:45:45.719 right that's let's and so we're look at
01:45:47.320 who we going to get and all of a sudden
01:45:49.679 she comes in sir Dana White just said
01:45:51.800 he's going to do it and he's coming back
01:45:53.599 in tonight he's taking you know the guy
01:45:55.679 is just a incredible guy and he's like a
01:45:58.880 tough Champion but loyal yeah he's got
01:46:02.760 to be one of your favorite people he's
01:46:04.159 one of my favorite love to death I've
01:46:05.679 been friends with him for 23 years I
01:46:08.080 love him so would you have um because
01:46:10.719 you're what you're doing here is
01:46:11.920 incredible I mean everybody tells me all
01:46:13.679 I know is today I'm going you know
01:46:15.960 you're and Joe Rogan people tell me like
01:46:18.199 I said I say how the hell do you know
01:46:20.159 that but it's it's sort of what you've
01:46:22.679 done here is amazing where would you be
01:46:25.159 if you didn't do the UFC stuff would you
01:46:27.000 have this show do you think yeah I would
01:46:28.440 still be doing it for sure yeah would be
01:46:30.520 the same would it be at the same level I
01:46:32.280 don't know but you would have it's hard
01:46:34.520 to know I think you know one of the
01:46:36.440 things that works for this show I guess
01:46:38.360 is that I I'm involved in so many
01:46:39.960 different things you know standup comedy
01:46:42.199 UFC and all the interest that I have
01:46:44.639 that lead to the podcast will you always
01:46:46.719 want to do you first of all you love UFC
01:46:49.040 I love it yeah you love the fights I
01:46:50.440 mean I watch you you are loving it they
01:46:52.480 could pay you nothing it'd be very they
01:46:54.199 didn't pay me anything for the first
01:46:55.440 like 13 shows I did it for free cuz they
01:46:57.280 were hammering money and I became
01:46:59.400 friends with Dana and my my position was
01:47:02.080 you're going to give me the best seat in
01:47:03.360 the house I get to sit cage side for the
01:47:05.960 fights I like I'll do it and I wanted to
01:47:07.880 help I was like I think these are the
01:47:09.800 guys that we had always hoped for in the
01:47:11.719 early days of the sport I started
01:47:13.280 working for the the company in 1997 I
01:47:15.639 was the before the UFC was purchased by
01:47:17.679 zua which Dana work for so I I was a
01:47:20.080 part of the previous owners and I only
01:47:22.480 did it for a couple years it was just
01:47:23.719 too much and I was losing money and it
01:47:25.400 was banned from cable because of
01:47:27.560 Budweiser and John McCain and you could
01:47:29.480 only get it on Direct TV and so and then
01:47:32.159 I came along and I gave him the S and he
01:47:34.440 loves you he never forgot it he he loves
01:47:36.159 you for that he talks about all the time
01:47:37.960 just interrupt you for one so he they
01:47:40.560 couldn't get a site because it was too
01:47:42.000 dangerous and everybody was against it
01:47:43.719 and they couldn't get license and I gave
01:47:45.880 him the first two or three sites and
01:47:48.480 they were great and by the way I went to
01:47:50.639 the first fight I said I never saw
01:47:53.159 anything like this it was crazy it was
01:47:55.119 so good take the best fight you've ever
01:47:56.800 it was like that fight right it was so
01:47:58.960 good that I gave it to him again again
01:48:00.800 and all of a sudden it caught on but you
01:48:02.599 know when I wasn't in Vogue you know
01:48:05.719 I've had time you probably never had a
01:48:08.159 time but I had times when I wasn't
01:48:09.599 exactly inv vog Dana they called him he
01:48:12.480 said he's the greatest guy there's
01:48:14.119 nobody like he said I'll never say
01:48:17.320 anything bad about that guy because when
01:48:19.639 I needed because they were having a hard
01:48:21.239 time at the beginning they almost pulled
01:48:22.960 the plug a couple of times right he said
01:48:25.320 he stood up and he gave us stuff that
01:48:27.639 nobody else gave us and nobody wanted
01:48:29.920 anything to do and he said I will never
01:48:33.440 and there was a time where it would have
01:48:35.719 been very popular for him to say bad
01:48:37.400 stuff about me he said the greatest
01:48:39.880 stuff about me he said you're going to
01:48:41.199 try and get me to say bad stuff about
01:48:43.000 Trump I'm never doing it he's a very's
01:48:45.599 an unusual guy very unusual guy he's a
01:48:48.320 fantastic guy a perfect guy to be at the
01:48:49.880 helm of something so controversial as
01:48:51.760 the UFC controversial now I mean well
01:48:54.480 now it's huge yeah well this was always
01:48:56.400 the thing that I would hop that it would
01:48:58.119 be I always knew that it was
01:48:59.360 unbelievably entertaining but I just
01:49:00.760 didn't know if maybe I was crazy maybe I
01:49:03.000 loved it because I've had this long
01:49:05.040 history of being involved in martial
01:49:06.440 arts and maybe like other people just
01:49:07.960 think it's too violent but can boxing
01:49:09.920 make it yeah boxing still a great sport
01:49:12.760 I love boxing but it seems to be so
01:49:15.880 unimportant Now by comparison to UFC
01:49:18.119 don't you think I think well you know
01:49:20.520 Dana is working with the the kingdom of
01:49:22.920 Saudi Arabia they're they're going to
01:49:24.520 start promoting boxing now and with Dan
01:49:26.760 at the helm of it I think boxing can
01:49:28.440 return because the thing is they want to
01:49:30.520 make fights that other PE maybe you know
01:49:33.880 promoters don't want to make because
01:49:35.360 they want to protect their fighter
01:49:36.599 controversial fights where you know it's
01:49:38.239 dangerous like you don't know this guy
01:49:39.679 could lose and so the Saudis they're
01:49:41.679 smart they just offer a tremendous
01:49:43.800 amount of money and they're putting
01:49:44.880 together Fighter fights that no one else
01:49:46.800 can put together they're doing that in
01:49:48.119 boxing if Dan is involved he'll probably
01:49:50.560 make it good you know the amazing thing
01:49:52.440 though the the in fighting no UFC
01:49:55.840 fighter they say has ever died and it
01:49:58.119 looks to me much more violent than bucks
01:50:00.800 many boxers have died isn't it
01:50:02.239 interesting and Dana tells me because
01:50:03.960 they take so many shots to the face yes
01:50:06.159 and there's also no other options to
01:50:07.840 preserve yourself to protect yourself so
01:50:09.480 if you get hit in a UFC fight you can
01:50:11.239 clinch you can try to take the fight to
01:50:12.960 the ground you get options also you
01:50:14.639 don't get allowed to get knocked down
01:50:16.080 and then get back up when you get
01:50:17.679 knocked down you're concussed and
01:50:19.760 generally you know if a guy's really
01:50:21.440 hurt they could be finished in in on the
01:50:23.400 ground and the fight's over if it's
01:50:25.040 boxing you have 10 seconds to get up you
01:50:28.239 get up your head kind of clears but
01:50:30.440 you're still in real bad trouble and
01:50:32.480 then you can kind of run away and
01:50:33.920 survive until the bell rings they're
01:50:35.639 only three minute rounds and then you
01:50:37.119 start again so you're getting repeated
01:50:38.719 punishment to the Head yeah you know and
01:50:41.000 then there's also the issue of guys
01:50:43.040 weight cutting you know which is a
01:50:44.320 problem with the UFC as well but weight
01:50:46.119 cutting in boxing has led to if you look
01:50:47.920 at deaths in boxing there's very few of
01:50:50.119 them in the heavyweight division most of
01:50:51.880 the deaths in box in or the lightweight
01:50:53.560 divisions because when guys dehydrate
01:50:55.360 themselves to to to lose weight to make
01:50:57.639 weight their brain is the last thing
01:50:59.880 that gets rehydrated like it's very
01:51:02.520 difficult to completely rehydrate
01:51:04.840 hydrate your brain quickly and you only
01:51:06.560 have 24 hours between the weighin and
01:51:08.360 the fight and it used to be the
01:51:09.840 weigh-ins were the day of the fight like
01:51:12.119 when when boom boom manini had a fight
01:51:14.320 with Duku Kim and killed him in the ring
01:51:16.360 which is one of the last ones on
01:51:17.840 television that we've seen that's right
01:51:19.440 that was a crazy event for people and
01:51:21.599 heartbreaking and it L to a bunch of
01:51:23.119 different changes and one of them is day
01:51:24.840 before we to allow people to rehydrate
01:51:27.400 better and the other one is they dropped
01:51:28.560 it from 15 rounds down to 12 which look
01:51:32.079 they should do that I you know I'm not
01:51:33.960 I'm not the fighter so but those 15
01:51:36.280 round fights were unbelievable they were
01:51:37.760 unbelievable un unbel you go back Golden
01:51:40.560 Age yeah in terms of entertainment oh
01:51:42.960 yeah those were the the championship RS
01:51:45.000 those were the greatest fights those
01:51:47.239 last three rounds were crazy I mean it's
01:51:49.480 such a war of attrition you know a lot
01:51:51.239 of people think even like a five round
01:51:52.920 UFC fight that the UFC is f minute
01:51:55.760 rounds it's so much energy you're
01:51:57.520 burning out and those last couple of
01:51:59.440 rounds those five round fights the
01:52:01.079 fourth and the fifth round unbelievably
01:52:03.440 brutal who's the greatest UFC fighter in
01:52:05.560 you are you allowed to say in your
01:52:07.079 opinion it's tough for you to say
01:52:08.320 because you do this but who do you think
01:52:10.040 is the greatest of the fighters there's
01:52:12.199 there there's a lot of arguments for
01:52:13.760 who's the greatest of all time you know
01:52:16.000 uh John Jones most people would say he
01:52:19.079 the greatest of all time never lost uh
01:52:21.800 it's a there certainly a really good
01:52:23.239 argument for that there's another
01:52:24.480 argument for George St Pierre uh I
01:52:27.000 always leave in BJ Penn in his prime
01:52:29.159 Anderson Silva in his prime um you know
01:52:32.320 Mighty Mouse people forget about Mighty
01:52:34.239 Mouse because unfortunately he's a
01:52:35.520 smaller guy he's 125 pounds flyweight
01:52:37.800 Champion he's one of the greatest
01:52:40.040 expressions of mixed martial arts I've
01:52:41.679 ever seen I think to this day what kabib
01:52:44.520 is fantastic but if you looked at like
01:52:46.560 accomplishments in terms of championship
01:52:48.280 fights kabib retired 29 and0 but he
01:52:51.040 didn't have as many
01:52:53.800 they say he might have lost to glaz and
01:52:55.599 Tau he might have lost to him might have
01:52:58.000 lost round and that was a controversial
01:53:00.040 fight where people think that glaz and
01:53:02.000 Tau could have even got the decision in
01:53:03.639 that fight I'd have to go back and watch
01:53:05.040 it again to make a decision but uh
01:53:07.199 they're great athletes oh the best
01:53:09.040 athletes in the world and the the most
01:53:11.320 dangerous sport in terms of like it's I
01:53:14.639 always call it highlevel problem solving
01:53:16.800 with dire physical consequences it's
01:53:18.760 just brutal that's what fighting is you
01:53:20.199 know I I never forget so there was a
01:53:22.560 fighter named James T Tony oh yeah I
01:53:25.040 love James Tony he fought as a very
01:53:27.159 light fighter and he ended up as a
01:53:28.679 heavyweight this guy went through
01:53:29.960 everything he was almost like a
01:53:31.239 lightweight he went from middleweight
01:53:32.880 all the way up to heavyweight yeah beat
01:53:35.159 holfield as a heavyweight and he was a
01:53:36.599 real fighter oh yeah so James Tony and I
01:53:39.400 think it was uh St George uh George St
01:53:43.239 Pierre St Pierre I think it was him who
01:53:45.719 did he fight James Tony no um James Tony
01:53:48.960 didn't fight George he fought a UFC
01:53:50.800 fighter yeah Randy cure fought James
01:53:52.960 Tony was it that was like an easy fight
01:53:55.520 that was a very easy fight Randy cotour
01:53:57.040 just took him down and it was the most
01:53:58.719 and he's half the size and he just once
01:54:01.960 he got to the ankles in fact the announc
01:54:03.719 said it's over yeah took him down
01:54:06.320 mounted him strangled him it was pretty
01:54:08.239 he was but he was talking big because he
01:54:09.920 was much bigger he was a pretty big guy
01:54:11.800 think James just wanted to make some
01:54:12.840 money and you think so but I never
01:54:14.960 forgot it it was over very quickly and
01:54:17.760 he was lying sleeping on the mat and he
01:54:19.880 was talking you know he was doing the
01:54:21.119 Muhammad Ali stuff but it didn't work
01:54:22.679 out but I remember the fight yeah that
01:54:24.520 was cure probably yeah it was cure
01:54:26.639 George never fought a boxer in an MMA
01:54:29.000 fight if he did he would kill him was he
01:54:31.400 was he one of the greatest yes
01:54:32.960 unquestionably that's the the argument
01:54:35.000 there's like a handful of guys you can
01:54:36.320 make the argument is the greatest of all
01:54:37.639 time people forget about Anderson Silva
01:54:39.560 in his prime he was Unstoppable it's but
01:54:42.239 that's the thing is and then there's
01:54:43.480 Fedor milliano who fought in Pride in
01:54:45.679 his prime he was Unstoppable there's
01:54:47.679 there's this and you have a couple now
01:54:49.040 that are pretty good oh we've got so
01:54:50.679 many now Alex Pereira
01:54:52.840 there's an argument that he's the topfor
01:54:54.800 fighter in the world now he's it's
01:54:57.000 unbelievable but it's like Fighters can
01:54:59.360 only compete at that level for so many
01:55:01.320 years and so my opinion you have to
01:55:03.440 judge them at their very Peak you can't
01:55:05.560 judge them when they're hanging on and
01:55:07.000 still fighting you can't judge them when
01:55:08.480 they're coming up you got to judge them
01:55:10.199 in that Championship peak in that
01:55:12.960 Championship Peak there's a handful of
01:55:15.000 guys that you would consider at the very
01:55:16.719 top if they stopped a little bit sooner
01:55:19.760 yeah some of them would have had you
01:55:21.079 know I mean there are a couple of that
01:55:22.480 you just mentioned without mentioning
01:55:24.000 names and they stopped they had the
01:55:25.599 perfect they were unbelievable and then
01:55:27.760 at a certain age they start getting
01:55:29.079 knocked out right yes it's unfortunate
01:55:31.560 but the thing is that same belief in
01:55:33.599 themselves that lets them become a
01:55:34.880 champion makes them think that they can
01:55:36.480 do it long past the time that they
01:55:38.119 actually can well Anderson Silva was
01:55:40.280 essentially unbeatable and then he lost
01:55:42.679 a CL one and then all of a sudden he had
01:55:44.119 no he got knocked out he got knocked out
01:55:45.480 by Chris Weidman right uh he was kind of
01:55:47.440 clowning in that fight famously and C
01:55:49.440 Chris Weidman had a vicious left hook
01:55:51.280 knocked him out and then they fought a
01:55:52.920 second time and he broke his leg on
01:55:54.560 Chris Weidman right that's right and
01:55:56.440 after that fight he was kind of never
01:55:58.239 the same because that that leg break
01:56:00.920 injury which Conor McGregor had there's
01:56:03.199 quite a few Fighters Wiman actually W up
01:56:05.320 having the same injury ironically
01:56:07.199 there's only been like you're never the
01:56:08.920 same cuz you can't kick never the same
01:56:10.480 well you can Weidman is still kicking
01:56:12.480 with that leg you can but
01:56:14.000 psychologically when you throw a kick
01:56:15.599 and your leg snaps in half and you're in
01:56:18.000 agony for a year right you have to get
01:56:20.079 surgery you have to get bolts and plates
01:56:22.360 keep your leg together and then it takes
01:56:24.040 forever for it to heal it always amazed
01:56:26.800 me how the kicker I mean you have those
01:56:29.000 cases but the kicker will do tremendous
01:56:31.560 damage to somebody's leg but their leg
01:56:33.800 doesn't seem to get damaged isn't it
01:56:35.440 sort of it does get damaged it hurts
01:56:37.360 more than you yeah but your shin you you
01:56:39.599 your shin gets very numb after a while
01:56:41.760 and guys that are really good kickers
01:56:43.760 they're kicking the thigh and they're
01:56:45.159 kicking the C they kicking soft areas
01:56:47.840 and they're slamming this hard numb Shin
01:56:51.159 their Shin gets all these like micro
01:56:53.639 fractures all over the shin and it
01:56:55.320 calcifies like these guys can kick
01:56:57.239 baseball bats you ever see them break
01:56:58.679 baseball bats with their Shins It's
01:57:00.880 Crazy some guys can do two baseball bats
01:57:02.960 someone will hold the baseball bat and
01:57:04.159 they just kick right through them I
01:57:06.360 watch your enthusiasm now right yeah and
01:57:08.599 it's like that's why you're good at what
01:57:10.719 that's why nobody does this better that
01:57:13.199 without the enthusiasm forget it well it
01:57:15.639 has to be authentic like that I mean the
01:57:17.639 only reason why I do MMA commentary is
01:57:19.480 cuz I I'm very interested in it for real
01:57:22.320 it's I'm not I don't have to manufacture
01:57:24.119 it I'm very interested so I and you love
01:57:26.719 going in there after the fight and
01:57:28.159 they're sweating all over you they're
01:57:29.679 slopping all over you you're B on
01:57:31.880 they're bleeding does that bother you a
01:57:34.239 little bit Yeah like two weeks ago with
01:57:36.199 a guy was he I never saw Round Tree yeah
01:57:39.239 he more stuff came out of his nose yes
01:57:41.760 it was pretty nasty but no I'm very used
01:57:43.920 to it I just wanted him to be able to
01:57:45.840 express himself you've done a great job
01:57:47.599 thank you you've done a great job so
01:57:49.800 back to you and back to what what are
01:57:52.880 you and first of all I love this idea of
01:57:55.239 you teaming up with Robert Kennedy right
01:57:57.360 and I love this make America healthy
01:57:59.239 again idea because there are chemicals
01:58:02.880 and ingredients and in our food that are
01:58:05.119 illegal in other countries because
01:58:06.880 they've been shown to be toxic there's
01:58:10.079 pesticides and herbicides and there's a
01:58:12.440 lot of that's been sprayed on our
01:58:14.239 food that really is unnecessary and
01:58:16.639 there's a lot of Health consequences
01:58:18.239 that people are suffering from a lot of
01:58:20.880 these things and to chart for you
01:58:22.960 beautiful because I had a feeling you'd
01:58:24.159 be asking me look at this chart these
01:58:26.679 are healthier countries look where the
01:58:28.119 United States is I'm going to send this
01:58:29.639 to RFK Junior look so this is uh well
01:58:34.280 something along the I was actually
01:58:35.920 talking to RFK today and he told me that
01:58:38.599 more than 70% of young men are
01:58:41.719 ineligible for the military because of
01:58:43.960 their health I could say it that's a lot
01:58:47.119 of it's obesity so here's the life
01:58:48.719 expectancy vers versus Health
01:58:50.719 expenditure same
01:58:52.760 yeah did you see that USA that's pretty
01:58:55.360 good Jam's the best he's very good he's
01:58:57.320 the best no but look at that look at the
01:58:59.760 US not good and that's our food that's
01:59:02.360 our diet that's that's sedentary
01:59:04.159 lifestyle that's our diet that's the
01:59:05.760 chemicals we ingest that's what that is
01:59:08.280 but RFK is going to be very you know I
01:59:10.960 think he's a great guy I I love the fact
01:59:13.480 that you guys teamed up and are you guys
01:59:15.639 are you completely committed to have him
01:59:17.599 a part of your Administration oh I am
01:59:19.119 but the only thing I want to be a little
01:59:20.800 careful about with him is
01:59:22.760 uh the environmental because you know he
01:59:24.679 doesn't like oil I love oil and gas I
01:59:26.679 think you know I think keep him out of
01:59:28.000 that to fire so I'm going to sort of
01:59:29.520 keep him out of a little I said focus on
01:59:31.960 health Focus you can do whatever you
01:59:33.719 want but I got to be a little bit
01:59:35.760 careful with the liquid gold you know I
01:59:38.320 understand um but listen there's plenty
01:59:40.199 of good work that could be done if you
01:59:41.560 focus on health here's the one that
01:59:43.280 here's the one that my all-time favorite
01:59:45.159 though see the arrow right here that's
01:59:47.119 what I left do you have anyone that is
01:59:49.800 pressuring you to not work with him have
01:59:52.400 have there been people RFK Jr there yes
01:59:57.280 I would imagine because financially he
01:59:59.599 could put it I would say that and you
02:00:02.800 know the I think in many ways they've
02:00:05.000 done a good job and many ways they've
02:00:06.480 done a bad job but I would say that the
02:00:08.960 uh big
02:00:10.440 Pharma wasn't thrilled when they heard
02:00:12.960 that you don't have a Rel I've actually
02:00:15.119 always gotten along very well with him
02:00:16.760 I've known him a long time he's a
02:00:18.960 different kind of a guy he's very smart
02:00:20.639 great guy and he's very sincere about
02:00:23.199 this I mean he really is you know he
02:00:24.880 thinks we we spend a fortune on
02:00:27.239 pesticides and all this stuff and then
02:00:28.880 you end up with that chart is a terrible
02:00:30.960 chart the one previous it's such a bad
02:00:33.719 chart when you look at where we are
02:00:35.239 compared to other countries that don't
02:00:36.719 spend 10 cents so you know and you save
02:00:39.280 a lot of money but yeah we I've had some
02:00:41.400 people that aren't exactly
02:00:43.079 thrilled you can imagine right sure it's
02:00:45.679 a good question actually well certainly
02:00:48.040 if there have it doesn't affect me some
02:00:50.360 pharmaceutical drugs that have been
02:00:52.159 prescribed that have negative
02:00:53.719 consequences that these people have been
02:00:55.880 profiting off of and then you have a guy
02:00:57.679 like RFK Jr who spends an enormous
02:01:00.040 amount of time highlighting those things
02:01:01.719 you could say how they' be very
02:01:02.880 reluctant to have you support him I
02:01:05.159 would say that's an understatement yes
02:01:07.000 yeah so how what do you do to stop that
02:01:09.800 from getting in the way well look
02:01:12.480 they've come up with some amazing things
02:01:14.440 I mean I don't know how you feel I know
02:01:16.000 you're against the VAC certain vaccines
02:01:18.719 but like the polio vaccine people had
02:01:21.199 Polio they were it was like a
02:01:23.360 disaster and they came up Dr sulk and he
02:01:26.560 came up with a vaccine and there's no
02:01:28.159 polio now it very interesting there
02:01:30.520 hasn't been polio but now in the Gaza
02:01:32.360 Strip can you believe that have you
02:01:33.880 heard that there's been a big strain of
02:01:36.199 polio coming out in the Gaza Strip is it
02:01:38.960 vaccine derived polio because you know
02:01:40.880 there's there's a strain of polio that
02:01:42.520 comes directly from the vaccine because
02:01:44.079 unfortunately sometimes you vaccinate
02:01:45.719 people for poo see I haven't heard that
02:01:48.320 yeah yeah I mean all I can do is I sit
02:01:51.159 down and listen to him and and I'll give
02:01:53.520 it a total I would love him to be right
02:01:56.840 because it's if he's right it's a lot
02:01:58.599 less expensive generally there two
02:02:00.239 things that people point to when they
02:02:02.440 point to uh the the dangers of uh the
02:02:05.960 pharmaceutical drug industry one thing
02:02:08.119 is when pharmaceutical drugs were
02:02:09.800 allowed to advertise on television we're
02:02:12.000 only one of two countries in the world
02:02:14.239 that allow pharmaceutical drugs to
02:02:15.800 advertise on TV the other one's New
02:02:17.800 Zealand but they're they're more
02:02:18.960 restrictive than we are people are those
02:02:21.159 ads Those ads you hear like you know
02:02:23.040 take a certain drug and then you hear
02:02:24.400 all theen it causes cancer and boldness
02:02:27.280 we don't like boldness this and that and
02:02:29.480 iight and you can lose your vision and
02:02:31.480 you know I just I actually asked one of
02:02:33.119 these guys I would never take I me
02:02:35.840 because there's things that are so bad
02:02:37.320 they go through a whole list I guess
02:02:38.599 they save some liability but man I said
02:02:41.800 does that affect the purchase and they
02:02:43.880 say it really does when they when
02:02:46.880 there's something you have and you read
02:02:49.239 and then they go through the list of
02:02:51.000 side effects potential side it's not
02:02:52.840 even the potential side effects I mean a
02:02:55.880 lot of people are just I I asked that
02:02:58.159 question people hear that when I hear it
02:03:01.000 I I'm going to take a p that says may
02:03:03.480 affect your vision may cause blindness
02:03:06.079 may this yes and but well I know you're
02:03:08.040 aware of call and Casey means right yes
02:03:10.480 well one of one of the things that they
02:03:11.880 pointed out and this is a very important
02:03:13.840 thing for people to understand is what a
02:03:15.880 lot of these drugs do is they they act
02:03:20.199 to to some or another mitigate the
02:03:22.920 effects of poor metabolic Health uh but
02:03:25.760 most of these problems that these people
02:03:27.639 are suffering from wouldn't exist if we
02:03:29.840 put an emphasis on metabolic Health if
02:03:32.119 people got healthier they started eating
02:03:34.159 nutritious food and taking vitamins a
02:03:36.520 whole host of these problems that people
02:03:38.800 are having would go away and the problem
02:03:41.560 with that from the pharmaceutical drug
02:03:43.159 standpoint is they wouldn't be able to
02:03:44.480 sell drugs to these people and this is a
02:03:46.960 fear the pesticides and things like that
02:03:49.360 on the plants and the what do you think
02:03:51.159 of that it's terrible well I think
02:03:53.199 regenerative agriculture unfortunately
02:03:55.480 is very difficult to scale to a point
02:03:57.239 where you got a Jack In The Box on every
02:03:58.520 corner that's right if everybody wants
02:03:59.920 food and we have food deserts and we
02:04:01.559 have places like Los Angeles where no
02:04:03.280 one's growing anything and everything
02:04:04.920 has to be shipped in and it's very
02:04:07.159 difficult to feed that many people we've
02:04:09.360 created this incredible Society where we
02:04:11.679 have these enormous cities but it's in
02:04:13.920 it's very difficult to get food to these
02:04:15.920 people and then for a lot of these
02:04:17.400 people in lowincome areas the only food
02:04:19.719 that's available is cheap unhealthy F
02:04:22.159 that's right and we could fix that that
02:04:25.239 that's if we could send $175 billion to
02:04:27.800 Ukraine we could do something to fix a
02:04:29.960 lot of the health problems that the
02:04:31.320 United States has and I think it would
02:04:33.719 it would help us as a nation overall
02:04:36.800 just if you just put it out there that
02:04:38.840 hey as a nation we're going to make a
02:04:40.760 concerted effort to get people healthier
02:04:42.599 just put it out there and people start
02:04:44.400 making better choices well when you look
02:04:46.079 at that chart I I was I just they just
02:04:48.480 gave me that chart because they said you
02:04:49.760 may want to discuss this topic which I
02:04:51.960 know is a big topic for you and when I
02:04:54.199 looked at that chart and I looked at how
02:04:55.880 unhealthy we are as a nation that's a
02:04:57.840 that's a pretty big thing how are you so
02:05:00.040 healthy is it golf no it's genetics I
02:05:03.599 believe you know I'm a big gentics has a
02:05:05.280 big factor I really am I mean my father
02:05:07.920 was uh unfortunately it is a big factor
02:05:11.119 for health some people are just way more
02:05:12.719 robust but you do play golf a lot and
02:05:15.280 that is both of my parents it it's for
02:05:17.520 me it's good fres it really is it's
02:05:20.079 fresh you're outside um
02:05:22.159 even mentally you're focused on that
02:05:23.920 three-footer and for some for a couple
02:05:25.679 of hours you're not and I go quick I
02:05:27.800 play Fast real fast and I'm I'm in I'm
02:05:30.199 out but you know it gives me I was never
02:05:32.520 one that could like run on a treadmill I
02:05:34.880 just and I can do it you know when
02:05:36.280 passing a physical they asked me to run
02:05:39.199 on a treadmill and then they make it
02:05:40.679 steeper and steeper and
02:05:42.520 steeper and the doctor said it was at
02:05:44.960 Walter re they said it's unbelievable I
02:05:48.480 could have got I'm telling you I felt I
02:05:49.880 could have gone all day but I I said doc
02:05:52.880 I can do this all day long I'm not I
02:05:54.719 have no problem but it's boring to me do
02:05:57.679 you understand it's just boring golf's
02:05:59.320 exciting but I did it for so long they
02:06:01.599 couldn't believe it that I did it and I
02:06:03.800 never you know I don't do it I don't
02:06:05.400 really you know I have friends who run
02:06:06.639 in this stuff all day long but I had no
02:06:08.960 problem doing it but it's really boring
02:06:11.119 so with with golf or something you know
02:06:13.040 or tennis or whatever but golf as you
02:06:16.280 get older there's something really good
02:06:18.239 about it and you have competition with
02:06:19.960 yours
02:06:22.400 it's a great handicap Sport and it's
02:06:24.239 also a thing I think that's uh it cleans
02:06:26.440 your mind because when you're looking at
02:06:28.440 a a shot that's all you can think of
02:06:30.520 when you're executing it gives you a
02:06:32.280 couple of you know it's interesting like
02:06:33.840 with tennis if you're much better than
02:06:36.079 somebody you can't really play with
02:06:37.960 somebody you know it doesn't work you
02:06:39.119 can give them sort of the equivalent of
02:06:41.440 Strokes right but it's not the with golf
02:06:44.079 you can play with a lousy guy and give
02:06:45.520 him a stroke a hole or two strokes a
02:06:47.159 hole or something you know it's a good
02:06:48.199 handicapping sport but it gives me a
02:06:50.520 little exercise but I haven't played uh
02:06:52.480 in a long time I won a lot of I won 32
02:06:54.960 Club championships can didn't you play
02:06:56.880 right after you got shot uh no where I
02:07:00.280 what I did is I played with Bryson D
02:07:03.040 Shambo do you know Bryson yes the pro
02:07:05.960 uhhuh he's a great player and we played
02:07:09.159 it was a certain thing that we played I
02:07:11.280 guess called breaking 50 or something 50
02:07:13.440 we play From a Certain te and if you can
02:07:15.719 break 50 and it got tremendous ratings
02:07:18.800 sort of like a crazy thing it got he's a
02:07:21.719 great guy but wasn't that like a couple
02:07:23.159 of days after you got shot I don't know
02:07:25.520 I I know I that was one of the funniest
02:07:27.480 things you were on the golf course I
02:07:29.079 think I did yeah maybe I did but I you
02:07:32.360 know I view it very interestingly I'm
02:07:34.960 running for president of the United
02:07:37.760 States to me it's such a big deal it's
02:07:39.559 so important so I've got now the biggest
02:07:42.199 deal in the Free World it's it's a
02:07:44.000 hundred times bigger than the Super Bowl
02:07:45.840 and it's one person yeah so you're down
02:07:48.360 to two people and we start off at 9
02:07:53.360 billion cuz you have nine PE 9 billion
02:07:55.880 they say in the world who knows what
02:07:57.239 that number is but you get down to 350
02:08:00.079 million sadly we have no idea what we
02:08:02.000 have in this country but let's assume
02:08:03.400 it's 325 350 and you're down to two
02:08:06.920 people it's a biggest thing in the world
02:08:09.760 and when I heard she took off yesterday
02:08:11.559 and she took off the day before and
02:08:13.000 she's going to take off tomorrow or the
02:08:14.559 next day I haven't taken a day off in
02:08:18.159 56 days that's a long time I haven't
02:08:20.880 taken one day off I don't I didn't I
02:08:23.960 don't want to play golf this is too
02:08:25.559 exciting golf is great but this is too
02:08:28.559 exciting this is more exciting than
02:08:30.239 anything you can do and the also it's
02:08:32.159 the home
02:08:32.960 stretch it's the home stretch who would
02:08:35.280 take a day off so we have 11 days left
02:08:38.400 now and think of it so I think I've gone
02:08:42.079 54 55 days in a row no days off and I
02:08:45.480 make speeches often times you know
02:08:47.360 sometimes not but I make speeches and
02:08:49.440 when you make a speech am my speeches
02:08:51.920 last a long time because of the weave
02:08:53.599 you know I mean I weave stories into it
02:08:55.239 and if you don't if you just read a
02:08:56.800 teleprompter nobody's going to be very
02:08:59.000 excited you got to weave it out so you
02:09:01.719 but you always have to as you say you
02:09:02.840 always have to get right back to where
02:09:04.199 yeah otherwise it's no good but the
02:09:05.760 weave is very very important very few
02:09:08.000 Weavers around but it's a big strain on
02:09:12.480 your you know it's a big it's a lot of
02:09:14.520 work it's a lot of work uh you got to be
02:09:17.159 careful of the voice you can lose that
02:09:18.800 voice The Voice wasn't designed I said
02:09:20.880 today so I made a big one last night I
02:09:24.360 was in Las Vegas big one the night
02:09:27.559 before in Arizona big one I mean they're
02:09:30.639 all big we have the there's never been
02:09:33.480 anything like it in terms of crowd never
02:09:35.280 been close never been close they say he
02:09:38.719 talks about crowd says you know what's
02:09:40.480 very interesting so we get crowds that
02:09:43.840 are really big and I say you know I've
02:09:48.480 never had a story because I don't get
02:09:49.880 good press I don't think I've had a good
02:09:51.400 story in years I really don't I don't I
02:09:53.040 swear I don't think I you you were
02:09:54.400 talking about it a little bit with Oprah
02:09:56.480 everybody loved me I don't think I
02:09:58.920 became president of the United
02:10:00.800 States I did great the second time I did
02:10:03.520 much better I I don't want to get you in
02:10:05.719 in any disputes but I won that second
02:10:08.920 election so easy and not just because of
02:10:11.159 but let me let me get to that let's I
02:10:12.719 want to talk to you about that but
02:10:13.520 here's the thing I did that and now I've
02:10:15.880 gotten the nomination again and don't
02:10:17.800 forget to get these nominations you go
02:10:19.800 against very smart people Ronda Sanz was
02:10:22.000 hot got to go through him uh Nikki Haley
02:10:25.079 was hot had to go through her I went
02:10:27.440 through everybody record time right
02:10:29.960 record time I got three nominations a
02:10:33.360 row uh won the first time did much
02:10:36.000 better the second time you know I get
02:10:38.079 millions of votes more the second time
02:10:40.320 and now I'm doing it a third time and
02:10:42.599 and it's an incredible thing I never get
02:10:45.119 a good story I only get bad press now I
02:10:48.520 will say this it's a lot easier if
02:10:50.599 you're a Democrat if I were a Democrat
02:10:53.040 you get a lot of positive PRS I would
02:10:54.320 get a lot of positive PR no it's a it's
02:10:56.159 a creepy corrupt business and the the
02:10:58.480 media to a large extent acts as a
02:11:00.599 propaganda arm for the Democratic party
02:11:02.480 it's not it's not even believable yeah
02:11:04.159 it's believe I mean it's bizarre to
02:11:06.079 watch and mo you know most young people
02:11:08.760 I think are aware of it I think most
02:11:10.360 Boomers still unfortunately read the
02:11:12.320 newspapers and believe in CNN but it's
02:11:14.920 getting younger let me tell you it's
02:11:17.119 getting for us for a conservative and
02:11:20.119 you know I don't myself the Internet
02:11:22.840 it's cuz the internet's giving people
02:11:24.280 information that they're not getting
02:11:25.480 from anywhere else and they like the the
02:11:27.559 very fine people hoax the Russia gate
02:11:30.040 hoax all these different things they've
02:11:31.480 done they tried to pin on you that's
02:11:33.239 like it's a clear Distortion of what you
02:11:36.119 actually said the blood bath hooks I was
02:11:38.440 talking about the Auto industry it's a
02:11:41.960 blood bath because Japan and and China
02:11:45.480 are taking our Auto and I said it's a
02:11:47.840 blood bath they said ah he used the word
02:11:49.800 blood bath think it's going to be a
02:11:51.719 blood bath because they're going to take
02:11:53.000 over that's exact terrible thing they do
02:11:55.119 but that's the problem with propagandist
02:11:57.800 cuz they take things out of context and
02:11:59.400 of ultimately what they do is they
02:12:00.800 diminish their own credibility because
02:12:02.239 people don't want to listen to anymore
02:12:04.040 because they see that they've done that
02:12:05.559 and they recognize what's going on and
02:12:07.239 they feel insulted they're intelligence
02:12:09.719 well look at the ratings you know shows
02:12:11.760 like yours so I have a son who's very
02:12:14.400 smart and Tall Barren right and he knows
02:12:18.960 all about you he knows about guys I

02:12:32.920 it's a whole new world out there it's a
02:12:34.960 different world and I think you know I'm
02:12:36.440 I'm on Tik Tok now congratulations and
02:12:38.480 I've done really well no but you know
02:12:40.360 the crazy have you seen the numbers
02:12:43.040 billions like billions of hits it's
02:12:45.800 crazy I'm sure Tik tok's a wild
02:12:47.520 application and I've gone up 30 points a
02:12:51.159 Republican is always down 30 with young
02:12:53.360 people I'm plus 30 and I'm on T Tik Tok
02:12:58.079 it's had a huge impact young people are
02:13:00.119 rejecting a lot of this woke
02:13:02.360 young people are tired of being yelled
02:13:04.159 at and scolded they're they're tired of
02:13:06.400 these people that they think are
02:13:07.440 mentally ill telling them what the moral
02:13:09.760 standards of society should be today
02:13:11.520 people are upset it's a big there's a
02:13:13.280 big difference now even in just a couple
02:13:15.520 of years I was shaking hands with people
02:13:18.000 they young people the rebels are
02:13:19.880 Republicans now they're like you want to
02:13:22.040 be a rebel you want to be punk rock you
02:13:24.000 want to like Buck the system you're a
02:13:26.199 conservative now that's the that's how
02:13:27.880 crazy and then the Liberals are now
02:13:31.760 Pro pro- silencing criticism they're
02:13:35.119 they're Pro censorship online they're
02:13:38.199 they're talking about regulating free
02:13:40.360 speech and they regulating the First
02:13:42.400 Amendment it's bananas to watch Joe they
02:13:44.960 come after their political opponent well
02:13:47.360 they I got more guys I always say you
02:13:50.119 know I kid but I'm not kidding I've been
02:13:52.960 investigated more than alons Capone he
02:13:55.079 was the meanest of them all he'd kill
02:13:56.599 you in two seconds if he didn't like you
02:13:58.440 right I've been under investigation more
02:14:01.280 than alons Capone only because it's
02:14:04.000 political opponent stuff and I've won I
02:14:06.159 won the big case in Florida I I'm
02:14:08.119 winning the other stuff you win but you
02:14:10.880 know what they did they did something
02:14:12.400 that's only done in third world
02:14:13.840 countries they came after their
02:14:15.199 political opponent I could have put
02:14:17.079 crooked Hillary in jail well not only
02:14:18.920 that but they're they weaponizing it by
02:14:21.119 saying that that's what you're going to
02:14:22.599 do once you get in office ignoring what
02:14:25.679 they're doing right now it's crazy I
02:14:27.559 heard it somebody was defending me today
02:14:30.119 say no that's they say that's what
02:14:32.239 you're doing to him they're going he's
02:14:34.520 going to put us in jail he's going to
02:14:36.360 invest they said what you're that's what
02:14:38.520 you're doing to him a lot of people say
02:14:40.840 will you do that will you do that to him
02:14:43.440 if to them if you win you know it's the
02:14:45.920 presidency has tremendous power I could
02:14:48.520 have put crooked Hillary I respected
02:14:50.679 that you didn't because what you said
02:14:52.360 was it would be bad for the country no I
02:14:54.360 can't I couldn't even imagine you have
02:14:56.400 first of all Secretary State but more
02:14:57.840 importantly the wife of the president of
02:14:59.920 the United States of America going into
02:15:03.159 jail and if you ever saw when I'd say
02:15:05.440 something about her they all say I
02:15:07.119 didn't say it I never said it they say
02:15:09.159 lock her up lock her up and I'd always
02:15:10.920 go take it easy just relax we're going
02:15:13.079 to win this thing take it easy take it
02:15:14.559 easy and I'm telling you I kept it down
02:15:17.040 just the opposite now they say oh Trump
02:15:19.000 wanted to put her in jail no I saved her
02:15:21.800 from going to jail they had more stuff
02:15:23.920 on her and Comey had it because when
02:15:26.480 Comey got up and he stupidly because
02:15:29.040 he's a stupid guy too he goes a he's a
02:15:31.440 stupid son of a he got up Joe he
02:15:34.679 got up and instead of saying she's
02:15:36.840 innocent of all charges he went over
02:15:39.320 each charge and each charge was a killer
02:15:43.400 and he go and as far as her doing
02:15:46.239 this she's innocent and this and then
02:15:49.239 she's only a unfair Pro secutor for
02:15:51.760 would go but every time you heard these
02:15:54.079 charges they sounded so bad they were
02:15:56.920 bad and all it was is he wanted more air
02:16:00.199 time if he would have gone up and said
02:16:03.559 I've thoroughly investigated Hillary
02:16:06.520 Clinton and she's done nothing that we
02:16:08.800 feel is wrong it would have ended
02:16:11.119 instead he wanted to be up there because
02:16:12.960 he's a he's a PR Hound he's a hog and he
02:16:17.000 starts going through the and you know
02:16:18.280 what he had they had a huge problem
02:16:20.960 because FBI is great the people there
02:16:23.880 not the top people the people the real
02:16:26.520 people the people that work there it's
02:16:27.840 like the real generals that I told you
02:16:29.320 about that defeated Isis in record time
02:16:32.080 the FBI guys are great I'll bet you I'd
02:16:34.318 be at 95% in the FBI I bet that's right
02:16:38.519 underneath yeah and and so here's the
02:16:40.558 thing so he goes with Hillary and
02:16:42.398 instead of just saying he goes through
02:16:44.519 each charge right and even I was saying
02:16:47.718 man those are bad charges sounds
02:16:49.718 terrible cuz
02:16:51.478 those chares don't forget this is before
02:16:52.879 I got there now he was trying to protect
02:16:55.280 her but he did her a great disservice
02:16:58.000 because he wanted attention he was
02:16:59.478 stupid so I want to I want to talk about
02:17:01.120 2020 because you said over and over
02:17:03.200 again that you were robbed in 2020
02:17:06.000 totally what how do you think you were
02:17:08.160 robbed everybody always cuts you off I'm
02:17:10.160 G to allow well they not only cut you
02:17:12.080 off well what I'd rather do is we'll do
02:17:14.000 it another time and I would bring in
02:17:15.879 papers that you would not believe so
02:17:18.200 many different papers
02:17:20.959 that election was so crooked it was the
02:17:23.439 most crooked election okay but give me
02:17:25.439 some examples of how well let's start
02:17:27.160 let's start from the top and the easy
02:17:28.718 ones okay they were supposed to get
02:17:30.799 legislative approval to do the things
02:17:33.638 they did and they didn't get it in many
02:17:35.718 cases they didn't get it what things
02:17:38.398 anything legis approval like for
02:17:40.519 extensions of the voting for for for
02:17:42.679 voting earlier for this all different
02:17:45.000 things by law they had to get
02:17:47.160 legislative approvals you don't have to
02:17:49.318 go any further than that if you take a
02:17:51.718 look at
02:17:53.280 Wisconsin uh they virtually admitted
02:17:56.558 that the election was rigged robbed and
02:17:59.760 stolen they wouldn't give access in
02:18:02.718 certain areas to the ballots because the
02:18:05.959 ballots were in signed they weren't
02:18:08.318 Originals they were we could go into
02:18:10.760 this stuff we could go into the ballots
02:18:12.398 or we could go into the overall I'll
02:18:14.200 give you another one are you going to
02:18:15.478 present this ever uh like do you do you
02:18:20.040 think like just give you one more
02:18:22.240 before 51 intelligence Agents come up
02:18:27.359 that the laptop was from Russia it
02:18:30.959 turned out to be totally false 51 Former
02:18:33.679 Intelligence agents right they say that
02:18:35.478 made I don't believe it's this much but
02:18:37.558 it doesn't have to I won by like I lost
02:18:40.280 by like I didn't lose but they say I
02:18:43.200 lost Joe they say I lost by 22,000 votes
02:18:46.760 that's like one tenth of 1% less than
02:18:50.200 that it's a tiny little thing 22,000
02:18:53.318 votes spread over the that's spread over
02:18:55.638 this this period so 51 intelligence
02:18:59.959 agents lied they lied they lied they
02:19:02.799 knew it was it was Hunters it was from
02:19:05.599 his bed it was Hunter's laptop they said
02:19:08.398 it was created by Russia Russia Russia
02:19:11.558 it was the Russia hooks the Russia hooks
02:19:13.879 was a big HX it was all a big hook so
02:19:16.280 well that's clear one example that is a
02:19:18.558 good examp that's a big example they say
02:19:20.240 it made a 17o difference that's a big
02:19:22.920 example but that's only one and you can
02:19:26.120 go into the ballots where they wouldn't
02:19:27.840 give you access to the ballots you could
02:19:30.080 go into the ballot harvesting you could
02:19:32.599 go into $500 million for the lock boxes
02:19:36.679 but just in terms of narrative so
02:19:37.840 there's two things right there's the
02:19:39.160 Russia hoax there's the collusion with
02:19:41.240 Russia that was never proven right
02:19:43.160 that's one well it no it's proven it
02:19:44.519 didn't happen right right but but they
02:19:47.040 they talked about it on telev two and a
02:19:49.160 half years to prove but not only that
02:19:51.160 but it was a constant narrative on
02:19:52.640 television so that's a constant
02:19:54.600 narrative that gets into people's minds
02:19:56.160 especially lwi information people that
02:19:57.720 just watch the news that you're in
02:19:59.319 collusion with Russia so that's one so
02:20:01.000 that changes the narrative and then you
02:20:02.680 have the 51 Former Intelligence agents
02:20:05.280 that work with the original Twitter and
02:20:08.560 get them to remove links you can't share
02:20:10.640 it on DMS you cannot share that story
02:20:13.240 they they swept that story because they
02:20:15.319 said it was Russian disinformation even
02:20:17.319 though they knew it was not so that's
02:20:20.040 two examples that are real examples now
02:20:23.000 anyone who considers himself a
02:20:25.439 legitimate objective Observer of
02:20:28.200 American politics if you really want the
02:20:30.160 best person to win you would want people
02:20:33.319 to not lie and the only reason why they
02:20:36.240 got away with this lie was because they
02:20:38.120 continually labeled you as this horrible
02:20:40.800 threat to democracy and Hitler they kept
02:20:43.479 saying you're going to be a dictator
02:20:44.960 ignoring the fact that you wer a
02:20:46.960 dictator for the four years where you
02:20:49.080 actually the president I was actually
02:20:50.720 the opposite of a dictator I was a very
02:20:52.760 straight guy but look those three things
02:20:55.280 you take those three things each one of
02:20:57.479 them by themselves causes the result to
02:20:59.439 be different okay it does and then you
02:21:01.280 can go into a hundred other things there
02:21:03.399 are so many we can't have corrupt
02:21:06.040 elections and we can't have open borders
02:21:08.040 we need a we need you need to have a
02:21:09.760 country you need borders you need Fair
02:21:13.200 elections and I'll tell you the other
02:21:14.600 thing you need is you need a free and
02:21:17.200 fair press one of the things I like
02:21:18.960 about doing a show like this can can you
02:21:20.800 imagine kamla doing this show I could
02:21:23.319 imagine her doing lay she be laying on
02:21:25.760 the floor she was supposed to do it and
02:21:27.520 she might still do it and I hope she
02:21:29.319 does I will talk to her like a human
02:21:31.359 being I will try to have kind of an
02:21:33.240 interview with you I hope she does
02:21:36.120 because it would be a mess she'd be
02:21:38.040 laying on the floor com she' you'd be
02:21:40.319 saying call in the Medics I think we'd
02:21:42.399 have a fine conversation I think I'd be
02:21:44.040 able to talk to her I wouldn't try to
02:21:45.680 interview her I just try to have a
02:21:46.920 conversation with her and hopefully get
02:21:48.479 to know her as a human being that was my
02:21:50.280 goal
02:21:51.040 having her on trying to get her to
02:21:52.560 express herself just as I don't know if
02:21:54.479 these I don't think these formats are
02:21:56.840 good I don't think that two people first
02:21:59.439 of all I hate the idea of the
02:22:00.840 presidential debates because I hate the
02:22:02.399 idea of a Time limitation on complex
02:22:04.399 ideas also you have to break I think you
02:22:06.800 have to have the debates to right but
02:22:08.399 the way they do the debates I think is
02:22:10.040 the wrong way to do it I think they
02:22:11.359 should have a conversation I think you
02:22:14.120 and comma you sit across a table with no
02:22:17.080 one in the room but the two of you of
02:22:19.359 course you're not going to shout each
02:22:20.640 other of course you're not going to
02:22:21.920 insult I mean it may get they used to it
02:22:25.319 wouldn't but that would be the way to do
02:22:26.840 it they used to do it that way cameras
02:22:28.960 on you with no no one interfering with
02:22:32.240 press with with checking whether or not
02:22:34.840 it's factual especially when it's biased
02:22:37.439 because they checked you all those times
02:22:38.880 and they didn't check her with clearly
02:22:40.920 things that were inaccurate right so
02:22:43.520 have two people just have a conversation
02:22:45.520 with without a time constraint and also
02:22:48.120 this idea they cut off the the the
02:22:50.560 microphone no crowd no crowd crazy too
02:22:53.560 because you're good at working a crowd I
02:22:55.000 would rather have a crowd of course you
02:22:56.520 would you're good at crowds but I had no
02:22:58.720 so they gave me an alternative I don't
02:23:00.960 think he wanted to debate why did they
02:23:02.399 want no crowd what was the AR I think
02:23:04.200 they thought I wasn't going to accept it
02:23:05.439 so I believe what they wanted to do is
02:23:07.399 have me not accept so they gave me a
02:23:09.680 deal I couldn't refuse and I said I'll
02:23:12.880 do it okay it's like the mob right I'll
02:23:15.880 take it so they came to me they said
02:23:19.359 we'll debate Joe Biden you know that
02:23:21.479 thing got tremendous ratings to that was
02:23:23.479 crazy but we'll debate Joe Biden but you
02:23:26.399 can't have a crowd they also wanted
02:23:29.000 sitting down I said that's the only
02:23:30.600 thing I said look you got to you got to
02:23:32.040 stand up you can't really sit down you
02:23:33.840 know in the old days they did sit down a
02:23:35.120 little bit but but he gets tired you got
02:23:37.319 to stand up and they agreed to it it was
02:23:40.080 a very tough thing it almost killed it
02:23:42.399 they wanted to they wanted to have like
02:23:44.200 desks we we sit I said I think we should
02:23:46.840 stand up and that was the only thing I
02:23:48.560 asked for I said we got to stand up
02:23:51.279 I I thought it looked bad for like the
02:23:54.160 public but they said no crowd and cut
02:23:56.880 off the mic and I said I can live with
02:23:59.640 it I mean I could live with it and they
02:24:01.960 thought I was going to reject it and
02:24:03.359 then they would say he didn't want to
02:24:04.720 debate sleepy Joe right that's what they
02:24:07.560 thought was going well they tried to say
02:24:08.600 that with you and KLA as well they tried
02:24:10.160 to say that you didn't want to debate
02:24:11.160 her as well no by the way with her
02:24:13.560 number one I'm leading number two you
02:24:15.439 know I didn't they also said it with the
02:24:17.120 primary so I
02:24:18.880 had like 10 12 guys right in the primary
02:24:22.800 no stupid guys I mean you know they
02:24:24.560 Governors and they Center they're not
02:24:25.960 stupid people some are stupid but not
02:24:27.680 all of them and all my guys said you
02:24:30.640 have to be in the debate I said why I'm
02:24:32.840 leading by 74 points the closest guy to
02:24:36.520 me I'm I'm like 60 points 70 points
02:24:39.399 higher why would I stand there like an
02:24:41.800 idiot for two hours and let every one of
02:24:43.840 them scream at me I'm going to be the
02:24:45.479 focus what right and I said I'm not
02:24:47.840 debating and it was a very smart thing
02:24:49.680 because you know
02:24:51.000 it was they just killed themselves the
02:24:52.479 Republican primary yeah the Republican
02:24:54.399 primaries um with I like debating I
02:24:58.520 think de I think you have to debate but
02:25:00.720 I like I like debating the like the
02:25:03.200 Rosie O'Donnell debate I like debating
02:25:05.720 when you have a g remember the rosie
02:25:08.279 funny crazy thing Megan that was a hell
02:25:10.720 of a question man if I didn't come up
02:25:12.920 with that answer well what it was is you
02:25:16.200 know that was we had 28,000 people that
02:25:18.600 was the Cleveland Arena where the
02:25:19.960 Cavaliers played right LeBron James I'm
02:25:22.359 not a big fan of LeBron James but he is
02:25:24.040 a good basketball player but you know
02:25:26.279 that was the and when I said that the
02:25:29.439 place went crazy and she kept talking no
02:25:32.640 she had like 10 other yeah well Megan
02:25:34.840 said you said it to other people and you
02:25:35.960 admitted you did but it was funny it was
02:25:38.359 it was a comedic timing moment it was
02:25:40.080 fun that's what they wanted it was lucky
02:25:42.560 I did it because she was drown oh she
02:25:45.200 wasn't F that question but she kept
02:25:47.000 talking but you couldn't hear to this
02:25:48.920 day they don't know what she said but
02:25:50.359 wasn't buzzing so anyway but we had a
02:25:52.600 good time I it's comedic timing and
02:25:54.160 that's the reason why to have a debate a
02:25:55.680 debate in front of a large audience and
02:25:57.120 then they prob Smith dinner I got very
02:25:59.600 good reviews on that great that was
02:26:01.040 great it was very funny very funny stuff
02:26:03.160 the Tim wall stuff was very funny Tim
02:26:05.080 wall yeah he's funny that's a real be
02:26:07.479 that's a crazy one she the she said that
02:26:09.560 she had picked him and this one of the
02:26:11.080 question I want to ask her when she was
02:26:12.479 sleep deprived she said she was uh
02:26:14.920 suffering from sleep deprivation when
02:26:16.319 she picked him which is just I was he
02:26:18.920 maybe take a nap so I
02:26:20.800 okay look let's see how it all turns out
02:26:22.319 I think we're going to win I think we're
02:26:23.640 way ahead now I think we're way ahead
02:26:25.920 but but um can I bring you back to they
02:26:28.680 lose I I think they're going to look at
02:26:31.359 two things they're going to say they
02:26:33.000 should have had a primary even if it was
02:26:34.640 a short primary they shouldn't have
02:26:36.000 picked her and then she's going to say I
02:26:37.760 shouldn't have picked this guy she
02:26:38.920 shouldn't have picked that guy that guy
02:26:41.040 the the lying about tanan Square
02:26:43.399 admitted that yeah the military record
02:26:45.319 assisant coach versus head coach little
02:26:48.240 thing so I did McDonald's last week
02:26:50.760 I saw that and I actually got a call
02:26:52.359 from your friends at Google from Sundar
02:26:54.840 that's pretty good right he said this is
02:26:56.880 the biggest thing we've had in years you
02:27:00.319 McDonald's McDonald's did you know that
02:27:02.279 it was one of the it was funny who's a
02:27:04.800 great guy by the way but he said this
02:27:07.240 McDonald's thing I want to tell you it's
02:27:08.920 one of the biggest things we've ever had
02:27:10.680 on Google it just hit but the reason I
02:27:13.840 did and I actually you know you never
02:27:15.319 know about this stuff I thought it was a
02:27:16.600 throwaway M I didn't think our
02:27:18.479 conversation is a throwaway but I
02:27:19.920 thought that was I thought I'd walk in
02:27:21.800 and that was only to highlight the fact
02:27:23.640 and I I have a friend he owns like 56 of
02:27:25.920 these McDonald's and he said you want to
02:27:28.040 use one I said yeah I love it so we went
02:27:30.359 there and the crowd was crazy you know
02:27:31.960 they had 28,000 people s around the
02:27:34.319 whole thing did you see the outside it
02:27:35.760 was crazy the cars couldn't get through
02:27:38.120 Secret Service was not exactly thrilled
02:27:40.080 we had no idea what the hell but I went
02:27:42.359 into the place and I did the French FY
02:27:44.800 thing and it just hit but that's like in
02:27:48.319 life sometimes you do I thought it was
02:27:50.000 like a quick throw we're going to be
02:27:51.479 there for 15 minutes then I said I've
02:27:53.840 worked here for 15 minutes which is 15
02:27:55.880 minutes more than she worked here she
02:27:58.680 lied about McDonald's and you
02:28:01.319 know proven that she never she well
02:28:04.880 McDonald's has no information no she has
02:28:07.160 no information she there's nobody the
02:28:09.399 manager said she never worked there you
02:28:11.200 know it was a certain place and he said
02:28:12.720 they never no she lied she's a liar you
02:28:15.720 know what they do they'll say like on
02:28:18.399 any one of the questions take any
02:28:20.600 they'll say it's the exact opposite of
02:28:23.040 what I say IVF he's against IVF the
02:28:27.399 fertilization right he's and and it's
02:28:29.720 the exact opposite I was I came out
02:28:31.800 immediately strongly in favor and they
02:28:34.439 do ads I'm against it it's wrong uh on
02:28:37.880 every single topic and you know she
02:28:40.479 changed policies on 15 I've never seen a
02:28:43.600 guy change anybody change on more than
02:28:45.920 one you know you can maybe get away with
02:28:48.200 one her whole life fr in every single
02:28:51.600 thing that she was for uh the
02:28:53.880 confiscation of gun she wants to conf
02:28:56.040 now she's saying everybody should have a
02:28:57.479 gun in fact we're going to get her a
02:28:58.960 magga cap I'm going to send her a magga
02:29:00.880 cap but she's changed and I don't think
02:29:03.800 people are buying it I don't think
02:29:05.399 people are buying it well some people
02:29:06.920 are buying it because they want to buy
02:29:08.520 it because it's blue no matter who
02:29:10.040 there's there's a certain percentage of
02:29:11.439 our population that's going to vote
02:29:12.720 Democrat no matter what that's true
02:29:14.640 they're pressured there's their their
02:29:16.319 Community their ideology it's as good
02:29:19.680 right is I don't understand why okay you
02:29:22.439 have a wall or you have a you know I
02:29:24.800 built 570 mil of wall everyone say I
02:29:27.840 built a lot of wall exactly the stuff
02:29:31.200 but you have a border what I don't
02:29:34.160 understand is who would want people to
02:29:36.359 come into our country from places
02:29:39.120 unknown like sometimes they'll say about
02:29:40.720 a fighter from Parts Unknown right
02:29:43.439 remember Hast from Parts he say from
02:29:46.640 parts and the old days those are the old
02:29:48.240 days that's even before you but
02:29:51.160 uh who would want people to come
02:29:53.840 in pouring into our country we don't
02:29:57.200 know anything about but that's I want to
02:29:58.960 ask you this why do you think they're
02:30:00.439 doing that I think because do you think
02:30:02.120 they're trying to buy votes do you think
02:30:03.680 they just want cheap labor like what is
02:30:06.200 what's the idea there's a couple of
02:30:07.640 theories they hate our country they're
02:30:10.160 stupid or they want to buy votes it's
02:30:12.760 one of those three things yeah they want
02:30:14.720 now they are trying to get people
02:30:16.080 registered who you know don't even know
02:30:17.880 what the country is and they're trying
02:30:18.800 to give people amnesty people that live
02:30:20.760 here they're try
02:30:22.240 toenship and they
02:30:24.120 want you think about the amount of money
02:30:26.200 that they've given them when they've
02:30:27.319 come here the food stamps the benefits
02:30:29.560 that even our poor people aren't getting
02:30:31.120 $200 billion and and that's a way low
02:30:34.240 number that's a way low you know it's
02:30:36.240 it's interesting New York has always
02:30:37.680 been like uh you know sort of like
02:30:40.520 always looking for money they've spent a
02:30:42.960 hundred billion do on this stuff I I
02:30:45.160 don't know where they and they're not
02:30:46.240 getting the money from the federal
02:30:47.560 government it's crazy and because the
02:30:50.560 mayor came out and said we can't live
02:30:54.800 like this they investigated him he gets
02:30:57.600 I by the way I called it I said he just
02:30:59.920 got himself indicted this group is
02:31:03.080 stupid but they're vicious they're
02:31:04.920 stupid people but they're vicious people
02:31:07.120 the 2020 elections you say you have all
02:31:09.760 this evidence that it was rigged why
02:31:12.600 haven't you put this evidence in a
02:31:14.760 consumable form and what did oh I did I
02:31:17.439 have I have books on it and and by the
02:31:19.520 way books have been written on
02:31:22.160 it we have an author named Hemingway who
02:31:25.720 is a great writer she wrote a book on it
02:31:28.120 but many books have been written on it
02:31:30.319 there are books that
02:31:32.080 are what's happened is judges don't want
02:31:35.279 to touch it they would say you don't
02:31:37.359 have standing they didn't rule on the
02:31:39.279 merits they ruled the merits never got
02:31:41.800 there the judges didn't have what it
02:31:46.680 took to turn over an election let's talk
02:31:49.359 about the potential vulnerabilities for
02:31:51.120 elections and election fraud one of them
02:31:53.240 is mail in ballots the other one is
02:31:57.000 the if someone can break into voting
02:31:59.680 machines if someone can hack voting
02:32:01.840 machines those are two huge
02:32:04.720 ones Elon Musk I think he said it
02:32:07.880 publicly I hope he did because I
02:32:09.319 wouldn't want to be the one but he's a
02:32:10.960 really smart guy and he's a very good
02:32:14.000 guy with computers right you'd say he's
02:32:15.880 he's one of the smartest people Al alive
02:32:17.200 anybody that can land that 20 story
02:32:19.479 building
02:32:20.359 and perfect and while he's doing
02:32:22.080 starlink while he's talk while he owns
02:32:24.640 Twitter and then he agrees to starlink
02:32:26.640 and he tweets 100 times a day he's an
02:32:29.240 amazing guy right he said to me that
02:32:32.800 unless you have paper ballots it can
02:32:35.000 never be an honest election that's a big
02:32:37.040 statement it's a big statement we should
02:32:38.880 go to paper ballots you know France did
02:32:41.840 they went the mail in voting and it was
02:32:43.520 all messed up you know the amazing thing
02:32:46.160 with the machines so we have the
02:32:47.960 machines they cost 10 times paper ballot
02:32:50.600 would cost 8% and they make paper
02:32:53.240 ballots they all watermarked and
02:32:54.479 everything else very sophisticated but
02:32:57.279 if you take a look paper ballots 8% the
02:33:01.200 cost and you're done by 9:00 in the
02:33:03.880 evening right now we have the
02:33:06.000 sophisticated machine it goes up to
02:33:08.040 heaven it goes all over the place and
02:33:09.920 down and around and they say we'll need
02:33:12.240 two weeks to figure out who the hell won
02:33:13.800 the election do you think that's by
02:33:15.240 Design yeah I do I think it's I think
02:33:17.160 it's very crooked that's my opinion
02:33:19.080 you're allowed to have it opinion what
02:33:20.800 could let's say you win in November what
02:33:24.240 can be done to mitigate these problems
02:33:27.040 what could be done at a you know at the
02:33:29.880 level that the president has power well
02:33:31.840 if I win that'll be this will be my last
02:33:34.240 election but I think I owe it to the
02:33:36.720 country yeah but I think I owe it to the
02:33:39.200 country we have to have Fair elections
02:33:41.439 so how can you fix that you know Jimmy
02:33:42.880 Carter was the in charge of a commission
02:33:44.960 you know that many years ago and they
02:33:47.960 put him in scoop Jackson and very
02:33:50.160 Senators you know distinguished people
02:33:51.720 that were retired and they came up with
02:33:54.000 a report and the report's primary
02:33:56.439 finding was you cannot have mailin
02:33:59.479 ballots because if it's a mailin ballot
02:34:02.640 you know I went to the voting booth the
02:34:04.560 last time whatever it was and I walked
02:34:07.000 in in Palm Beach and I walk in and they
02:34:09.800 know me they say Mr President could I
02:34:12.240 see your identific bom here's this
02:34:14.279 here's that everything and then you sit
02:34:17.359 and you they watch you sign and you
02:34:19.880 really there's not a lot you can do I
02:34:21.720 mean if you want it to be dishonest it's
02:34:23.359 sort of beautiful right if instead of
02:34:25.600 that I'm going to send them a ballot
02:34:28.319 right it has to go through the Postal
02:34:30.560 Services it has to go through a lot of
02:34:32.560 people they mail you houses that you
02:34:35.479 know the house was demolished and the
02:34:37.000 people have left and it it's so bad the
02:34:40.880 one thing with Jimmy Carter he had a
02:34:42.960 very strong commission who no mail and
02:34:46.760 bels and we're the only one that does
02:34:49.000 elections this way anymore they've
02:34:50.680 gotten away from them and this is a it
02:34:52.479 ticked up in a big way after Co it used
02:34:54.279 to be like soldiers serving overseas
02:34:56.240 they used to cheat yeah well they used
02:34:58.399 Co to certainly push this mail and
02:34:59.920 ballot another thing but that's but they
02:35:02.680 used Co to cheat but here's another and
02:35:04.800 the last election was a little bit of a
02:35:07.359 you couldn't even get security guys big
02:35:09.760 strong guys to watch you know what you'd
02:35:12.120 call them they'd call them and this they
02:35:14.359 were afraid to go out you know we had we
02:35:15.960 were in the middle of
02:35:17.479 Co we were in the middle of Co it right
02:35:20.240 smack in the middle and they didn't want
02:35:22.319 to die you know they didn't want to
02:35:23.960 catch it it was like in a way it was we
02:35:27.479 it was like a ghost
02:35:29.000 town and the whole thing but mail and
02:35:32.279 ballots are bad thing bad thing that
02:35:34.439 that certainly is is a problem Ma mail
02:35:36.720 and ballots are problem problem vo ID a
02:35:40.040 voter ID voter ID is the most bizarre
02:35:42.720 argument that I've never seen anybody
02:35:44.920 articulate in a way that's convincing
02:35:47.040 why don't need voter well it doesn't
02:35:49.439 make makes sense any other way I've
02:35:51.160 tried to strawman it or I've tried to
02:35:53.080 Steelman it rather I've tried to like
02:35:54.720 look at it from a position like why
02:35:56.399 would you not want people to have ID and
02:35:59.359 a lot of the ideas are just ridiculous
02:36:02.040 the you need an ID to get a driver's
02:36:04.040 license okay but here's now the next
02:36:05.399 step Gavin nsam one of the worst
02:36:08.120 governors in the
02:36:09.479 world and I used to frankly I used to
02:36:11.640 get along but I don't get along with him
02:36:13.479 because he's just too you know it's just
02:36:14.920 a whole con job but Gavin nusum the
02:36:18.240 other day signed a bill
02:36:20.080 that you are not allowed to ask a person
02:36:23.200 even ask them whether or not they have
02:36:25.359 voter ID now what could be a Char reason
02:36:28.319 why anybody they want that would be the
02:36:30.760 only thing that makes sense that's
02:36:32.160 taking it to the next level right now
02:36:35.120 you know you have ID the Democrat
02:36:37.439 National Convention when they had it the
02:36:39.080 last time I saw they had a sign like a
02:36:41.880 billboard on the the name of the person
02:36:44.560 where they live how they live who the
02:36:46.760 hell their boyfriends are every single
02:36:49.960 it was and a big picture that's for
02:36:52.200 there they have an ID a big ID it was
02:36:55.160 hanging like you were a prisoner it they
02:36:57.880 had these massive cards everything and
02:37:00.720 yet when it comes to the vote in theory
02:37:02.800 the most important thing we do okay when
02:37:04.880 you go to a grocery store you give ID
02:37:07.800 but for a vote it's supposed to be a
02:37:09.640 sacred thing and it it should be a
02:37:11.160 sacred thing no voter ID because they
02:37:13.800 want to cheat well it doesn't make sense
02:37:16.439 in any other way I've tried to look at
02:37:18.439 it there's no other way there I there's
02:37:20.319 no argument that anybody's presented
02:37:22.040 that makes any sense why you know the
02:37:23.840 funny thing Joe the Democrats the people
02:37:26.279 they all think you should have it in
02:37:27.640 other words you should have if you go to
02:37:29.479 the people Mrs Schwarz Mrs Smith Mr Mrs
02:37:33.479 Jones sure they say of course yeah
02:37:36.240 Democrats they say yes it's the
02:37:38.680 politicians that don't want it like
02:37:40.279 Schumer and these guys they don't want
02:37:41.680 it because they want to be able to cheat
02:37:43.600 because you know what if they didn't
02:37:45.680 have it okay who is going to vote for
02:37:47.960 somebody that wants open borders who's
02:37:49.960 going to vote for somebody that wants to
02:37:51.960 have uh Men playing in women's sports
02:37:54.399 you know I have never had one person
02:37:57.120 come up to me and say president you got
02:38:00.000 to do something to allow men to play in
02:38:02.359 women's sports have you ever just like
02:38:05.160 I've never been called by a Polster I
02:38:06.760 told you my little theory on polsters
02:38:08.479 okay I'm getting myself in trouble with
02:38:10.319 some of these things but I don't really
02:38:11.640 care nobody's ever come up to me and
02:38:15.080 said we want to have men playing women's
02:38:18.319 sports and you know I had I had a funny
02:38:22.439 thing at a property I own in California
02:38:25.640 I have a woman who's a very good athlete
02:38:27.840 and she works there as a manager and
02:38:30.200 Brian eracer the big uh Chicago Bear
02:38:33.200 great player you know uh ttime Allstar I
02:38:36.200 guess Hall of Famer a great guy big
02:38:38.200 strong guy and they she said oh he's one
02:38:41.319 of my favorite athletes can I have a
02:38:43.240 picture and I took a picture and I sent
02:38:45.399 and I noticed she was the size of his
02:38:47.000 leg his leg was bigger than she was and
02:38:49.600 I put it out should men play in women's
02:38:52.640 sport the whole it was just so
02:38:54.359 ridiculous um what's one of the most
02:38:56.560 bizarre and polarizing ideas that's
02:38:58.800 promoted by the left but who wants it
02:39:00.680 now unless you're going to cheat in
02:39:02.840 elections you're never going to get
02:39:04.279 nobody wants it I don't think anybody
02:39:05.880 wants it I've never I've been told
02:39:07.840 everything you know you can some people
02:39:09.319 want
02:39:10.399 this I don't know if anybody that wants
02:39:12.760 open borders nobody's ever come up to me
02:39:14.720 and say president you got to let the
02:39:16.359 world come into our country right now if
02:39:18.840 they won so they have 21 million I think
02:39:21.080 it's much higher than that because you
02:39:22.120 have Goda aways you know Goda aways
02:39:23.439 where they just walk in they walk in by
02:39:25.840 and the other thing you have is human
02:39:27.200 traffickers you have traffickers and
02:39:28.640 they traffic in women and they're going
02:39:31.279 wild now we used to you know you have to
02:39:34.120 look the trunk of cars can you believe
02:39:35.880 it they put women in trunks they'll put
02:39:37.680 three women in a trunk these people are
02:39:40.160 savages they're horrible the worst
02:39:41.920 people the you and they're making the
02:39:44.240 kind of money they make on drugs they're
02:39:45.840 almost making on trafficking now and the
02:39:48.439 thing that's made it hot is the internet
02:39:50.920 that's what you know you think of it
02:39:52.920 almost as an ancient thing but it's the
02:39:55.439 internet but who would want to have
02:39:57.439 these things who would want to have
02:39:58.800 there's so many the transgender
02:40:00.800 operations where they're allowed to take
02:40:02.880 your child when he goes to school and
02:40:05.680 turn him into a male to a female without
02:40:09.160 parental consent who wants this does
02:40:12.319 anybody want this I've never heard of
02:40:13.840 anyone and I can go into 10 different
02:40:15.800 things the only way they get them is by
02:40:20.359 no voter ID you can't have voter ID they
02:40:22.880 don't want any they want to cheat
02:40:25.120 there's only one reason cuz the voter ID
02:40:28.319 is so basic it's the most basic thing
02:40:30.920 it's very basic who would want this they
02:40:33.680 want it so they can cheat because their
02:40:35.760 policies are no good their Pol I'll tell
02:40:38.240 you they're very smart when it comes to
02:40:40.520 that they're very smart although they're
02:40:43.000 not smart in terms of uh politics in a
02:40:45.640 way because what do they have that
02:40:47.960 people want they really don't have they
02:40:49.680 give away a lot of Health Care a lot of
02:40:51.160 stuff but for the most part their
02:40:53.399 policies are terrible their policy on
02:40:55.279 Military she's running on a tax she's
02:40:57.600 going to raise your taxes you got to
02:40:59.120 hear this we are going to raise your
02:41:01.560 taxes and the people clap but who is
02:41:04.319 going to win with her all my life I grew
02:41:07.760 up with politicians lower
02:41:10.479 taxes she's she's politi in that we are
02:41:13.800 going to raise your taxes well they want
02:41:15.600 to raise the idea is you want to raise
02:41:17.240 the taxes to the highest earners I know
02:41:19.000 but they think Millionaires and
02:41:21.000 billionaires are not paying their Fair
02:41:22.560 shares it doesn't work that way well
02:41:23.960 it's a narrative right and it's a
02:41:25.600 narrative that appeals to people that
02:41:26.960 are not doing well and like yeah our
02:41:29.279 problems are that these rich people are
02:41:30.800 not paying taxes well the problems are
02:41:32.520 the rich people are going to leave and
02:41:33.880 they're going to close up their
02:41:34.840 companies and then the other people
02:41:36.399 aren't going to have jobs you know
02:41:37.600 that's what happens it does happen in
02:41:39.040 other countries but the the whole
02:41:40.720 because you you brought it up I'll tell
02:41:42.399 you what we just uh uh he's doing a very
02:41:45.120 good job in Virginia Glenn yunan I don't
02:41:47.479 know if you like him not like him I
02:41:49.000 don't know but they oh you don't I'm the
02:41:50.760 governor of Virginia so we have a case
02:41:54.080 where they found thousands of illegal
02:41:57.200 ballots a judge just rulle that they
02:41:59.600 have to be able to vote just happened
02:42:02.040 today just before I walked in here I
02:42:03.560 heard uh a judge just ruled that you
02:42:07.880 have to keep those people in they're
02:42:09.520 illegal they're illegal votes now I
02:42:12.200 think they'll be overturned at the next
02:42:13.960 court one thing I found because I had a
02:42:15.880 couple of things that they got
02:42:16.840 overturned a little bit you know the
02:42:18.279 system because the system
02:42:20.160 you have to hope that the appella judges
02:42:23.720 are honest otherwise we don't have a
02:42:26.279 country anymore it's very important but
02:42:28.800 the whole thing with the legal ballots
02:42:30.160 has got to be looked at you got to have
02:42:32.000 you have to have voter ID and you have
02:42:34.160 to have additional ID you have to have
02:42:36.160 an ID that shows that you're a citizen
02:42:37.920 of the country I agree they don't want
02:42:39.600 that either I agree um one of the things
02:42:42.080 that I want to talk to you about is the
02:42:44.040 JFK files and one of the things that you
02:42:46.800 said was that if they showed you what
02:42:49.720 they showed me this was your quote you
02:42:51.520 wouldn't want people to know it
02:42:53.840 either um
02:42:56.520 so I I opened them up
02:43:01.000 partially I was met with from good
02:43:03.880 people I mean you know look at me good
02:43:05.560 people people that were well-meaning
02:43:07.960 Mike Pompeo was one of them he's a good
02:43:11.359 person uh they called me they said sir
02:43:14.720 would rather have you not after and I
02:43:18.520 did open them
02:43:20.359 but I was asked by some people not to
02:43:22.600 open them there's a Martin Luther King
02:43:24.359 file too by the way that they'd like to
02:43:26.080 see I don't know if you know but there
02:43:27.600 is that but but JFK in particular so
02:43:32.640 they call me a lot of good people call
02:43:34.359 me people that I you know that you would
02:43:36.200 find reasonable people and they asked me
02:43:38.760 not to do it so I said well we'll close
02:43:40.680 it for another time but if I win I'm
02:43:43.680 going to open them up I'm just going to
02:43:45.000 open enough times why didn't you open it
02:43:46.319 up the first time though what was the
02:43:48.200 hesitation though addresses people that
02:43:50.680 are still living there are people that
02:43:52.680 are affected um and there could be some
02:43:56.080 National Security reason that for you
02:43:57.960 know that I don't have to necessarily
02:43:59.479 know about but some very good talented
02:44:01.920 people asked me not to do it I opened it
02:44:04.520 up and then they said would it be
02:44:06.840 possible for us to do that a different
02:44:09.080 day what how much of it did you read
02:44:11.600 into uh
02:44:14.680 uh I think it's going to be just fine to
02:44:17.000 open it let me put it that way I think
02:44:18.600 it's fine it's going to be time it's a
02:44:20.600 cleansing you know it's really a
02:44:21.840 cleansing so I'm going to do it I'm
02:44:23.560 going to do it immediately almost
02:44:25.000 immediately upon entering office well
02:44:27.439 the thing when people look at it from
02:44:28.840 the outside and you sort of imagine what
02:44:32.000 could be a reason why they would not
02:44:34.960 release those files it would be there's
02:44:38.040 people that were implicated
02:44:40.319 assassination yeah well when there
02:44:43.080 living people you generally tend not to
02:44:44.880 want to do it when people are still
02:44:46.840 living living people that formerly work
02:44:49.080 for the government for the government
02:44:50.960 and living people that were somehow
02:44:52.560 involved in it and you tend not to do
02:44:54.399 that but it's time to open them um I
02:44:58.479 can't tell you whether or not uh they're
02:45:00.240 going to find anything of interest and I
02:45:02.319 did partially open I think I I've opened
02:45:05.359 50% but I was asked not to do it and I I
02:45:09.120 I thought that was a reasonable ask but
02:45:10.840 now I'm going to do it I'm going to do
02:45:11.920 it very soon there's a lot of interest
02:45:13.840 in it one of the things that there's a
02:45:15.359 lot of interest in uh the uh people
02:45:17.680 coming from space you know yes and I
02:45:19.880 know you're interested in oh I'm very
02:45:21.200 interested in that how much did they
02:45:22.319 tell you about that a lot really yeah
02:45:24.800 what' they tell you how much can you
02:45:26.960 tell so I how's that work is it like
02:45:28.920 super top secret tell you know well
02:45:31.040 based on Hunter Biden I can say whatever
02:45:32.600 the hell I want right but no but I
02:45:35.319 interviewed a few people it's never been
02:45:37.720 my thing I have to be honest I I have
02:45:39.439 never been a Believer I have people that
02:45:41.439 area 51 or whatever it is I think it's
02:45:43.800 the number one tourist attraction in the
02:45:45.520 whole country or something Area 51 at
02:45:47.960 Las V do you know that right sure I know
02:45:49.760 what it is so anyway but it's a big
02:45:51.680 tourist thing so I interviewed jet
02:45:56.479 Pilots that say they saw something if
02:46:00.080 you saw them you'd love to have them as
02:46:01.760 I've had a couple in here Commander
02:46:03.120 David fraver yeah I had him in who had
02:46:06.160 that sighting in 2004 very very
02:46:08.080 compelling with visual video evidence
02:46:10.520 radar evidence I Brian Graves I don't
02:46:13.479 believe his name but I I interviewed jet
02:46:16.920 Pilots that uh were solid people the
02:46:21.319 perfect I mean great Pilots great
02:46:23.399 everything and they said we saw things
02:46:25.720 sir that were were very strange like a
02:46:30.080 round ball but it wasn't a comet or a
02:46:32.120 meteor it was something and it was going
02:46:35.840 four times faster than an F22 which is a
02:46:38.359 very fast plan you
02:46:39.920 know and it was round um which isn't in
02:46:43.720 theory a great shape so when you were
02:46:46.200 talking to these people was was this
02:46:48.560 something thing that you were compelled
02:46:50.680 to have conversations about was this
02:46:52.279 your personal interest a little bit it
02:46:54.439 it's not a great interest for me but
02:46:56.160 it's a little interest I get that
02:46:58.000 question as much as almost any question
02:47:00.279 do you think that we have aliens coming
02:47:02.479 you know flying around or whatever what
02:47:04.399 do you
02:47:06.080 think there's no reason not to I mean
02:47:08.680 there's no reason not to think that Mars
02:47:10.960 and all these planets don't have life
02:47:13.040 you know because well Mars we've had
02:47:14.840 probes there and Rovers and I don't
02:47:16.960 think there's any life there well maybe
02:47:18.200 it's life that we don't know but maybe
02:47:19.720 well maybe there was life there at one
02:47:21.160 point in time this is the speculation
02:47:22.960 about Mars that Mars had a an atmosphere
02:47:26.120 at one point in time a long time ago
02:47:27.680 that could support life it ALS also had
02:47:29.319 large bodies of water but we've had no
02:47:31.760 evidence of even bacterial life that
02:47:33.800 exists on Mars but the univ not been a
02:47:36.399 big thing for me I mean when I looked at
02:47:38.479 what China did to this ad they would
02:47:40.240 have never done it with me where they
02:47:41.520 put the balloon up and a lot of people
02:47:43.479 thought and a lot of people thought for
02:47:44.720 a little while that that was one of
02:47:46.760 these things well that's a lot of the
02:47:48.040 speculation too that some of these
02:47:49.279 drones that hover over battleships that
02:47:51.279 these are Chinese drones and that
02:47:53.200 they're not UFOs they could be also
02:47:54.960 there's some super sophisticated I did
02:47:56.359 interview a let's say three or four guys
02:47:59.840 that and without tremendous interest if
02:48:03.600 you had
02:48:04.720 them as I said you'd love to have me as
02:48:07.479 your children solid beautiful people
02:48:11.880 they said sir there's something there
02:48:13.560 you know they' there's something they
02:48:15.439 said it yeah yeah I've talked to quite a
02:48:17.200 few of them they're not conspiracy guys
02:48:19.000 well I mean the just the commander David
02:48:20.880 fraver thing in 2004 off the coast of
02:48:23.120 San Diego they clocked that thing going
02:48:24.920 from 50,000 feet above sea level to 50
02:48:27.080 in a second yeah they don't know what it
02:48:29.160 is that's tough to beat yeah they they
02:48:31.040 saw something in the water it was
02:48:33.040 hovering over that something that was
02:48:34.399 making a disturbance in the water they
02:48:36.479 got video evidence of this thing two
02:48:39.080 different fighter jets with pilots in
02:48:41.399 them saw it there's you know Visual
02:48:43.840 Evidence photographic evidence video
02:48:45.840 evidence radar evidence whatever the
02:48:47.800 hell it is it moves in a way that would
02:48:49.359 turn a human being into Jello if they
02:48:51.040 inside of it the GeForce no one would
02:48:52.960 survive like what is that and we don't
02:48:55.720 they it doesn't have a heat signature
02:48:57.479 they don't know what their propulsion
02:48:58.680 system was but when you fly in some of
02:49:01.720 these
02:49:02.960 jets these Pilots have to be in great
02:49:05.479 shape oh yeah I flew with the Blue
02:49:07.200 Angels once yeah I got the fly I guess
02:49:10.640 and those are older machines and they're
02:49:12.479 crazy when you when you fly in
02:49:14.160 somebody's things amazing yeah but you
02:49:16.920 got to be special but these things these
02:49:19.040 people are en counting are far superior
02:49:20.960 to what we know of yeah do is it
02:49:23.479 possible that there's some military or
02:49:26.239 government program that you weren't that
02:49:29.160 they didn't tell you
02:49:30.720 about I I think I had a great
02:49:32.880 relationship with the military basically
02:49:35.080 but you know I didn't like certain
02:49:36.560 people I would have gotten them out if I
02:49:38.000 thought if I were if the election was
02:49:40.920 different I would have fired you know
02:49:43.399 all of them quickly some most of them I
02:49:45.359 did fire uh Biden should have fired
02:49:47.640 every military person involved with
02:49:50.840 Afghanistan he should have had a lot of
02:49:52.720 firings you know if you look at him he
02:49:54.479 told Israel not to do anything and at
02:49:56.160 least Israel's not going to looking at a
02:49:57.680 bomb the way they would have been think
02:49:59.479 if they listen to Biden they'd be
02:50:01.640 waiting for a bomb to drop on their head
02:50:03.520 right
02:50:04.399 now he's been wrong about so much I
02:50:06.880 guess you'd have to say that she's been
02:50:08.239 wrong too because you know they she
02:50:09.880 always said they made the decision
02:50:11.840 together but uh Israel didn't follow his
02:50:15.920 advice and I think it was a very uh you
02:50:19.040 know there it's a very the Middle East
02:50:20.760 is rapidly changing you know there are
02:50:23.920 prophets that say the world will come to
02:50:25.840 an end in the Middle East you know that
02:50:28.479 right and we have weapons today that are
02:50:32.319 so scary when you look I rebuilt them
02:50:34.840 all and when you look at the weapons we
02:50:37.359 have today the biggest threat we have in
02:50:39.319 the world today is nuclear weapons and
02:50:42.080 we have other weapons too that are
02:50:43.520 devastating but the nuclear weapons the
02:50:46.080 biggest threat we have in the world
02:50:47.560 today and that's what
02:50:49.479 you I was talking about deescalation
02:50:52.520 with both China and Russia I'm telling
02:50:55.680 you we were going to deescalate they
02:50:58.000 were going to deescalate you got to be
02:50:59.439 careful we it's a little tricky playing
02:51:01.239 with them because they say we're going
02:51:03.080 to do it and they don't do it maybe but
02:51:05.880 they understood the curse too it's a
02:51:07.439 curse it's uh China's way behind us but
02:51:10.040 they'll catch us within five years so
02:51:12.080 let's imagine let's let's say you win in
02:51:14.840 November what do you do differently and
02:51:17.120 how do you change this course that it
02:51:19.560 seems we are on for World War II how do
02:51:22.319 you get us out of Ukraine how do you
02:51:24.720 stop what's going on in the Middle East
02:51:26.439 how do you put a stop to this well it's
02:51:28.520 it's a very uh to me it's an easy
02:51:31.399 question because I think I can do it
02:51:32.880 easily but it's a complex question in
02:51:34.720 the sense that the times change every
02:51:37.640 day
02:51:38.439 changes uh who's winning who's not
02:51:40.960 winning I mean Russia is a war machine
02:51:44.439 whether you like it or not it Just
02:51:46.239 grinds along grinds along you speak to
02:51:48.680 people like Victor Oran he'll tell you
02:51:51.319 it's a just a big fat War Machine and
02:51:54.720 that's what's happening you look at
02:51:55.920 what's happened to
02:51:57.279 Ukraine if I were there it would have
02:51:59.359 never happened but what you what could
02:52:01.319 you do now if you get into office in
02:52:03.200 January what could you do right now uh
02:52:06.760 you would get both of them I know both
02:52:08.600 very well and and again I I I cannot I
02:52:11.920 do not want to tell you you know for the
02:52:13.720 purpose of looking smart to fight people
02:52:16.040 that you know that say oh he was great
02:52:18.279 because because if I told you exactly
02:52:20.880 what I do I could I could never make the
02:52:23.160 deal all I can tell you is that I would
02:52:25.319 meet with Putin and I would meet with
02:52:26.880 him and I know exactly what I'd say to
02:52:28.840 each one of them and I believe that as
02:52:31.200 president-elect I would get that war
02:52:33.200 stopped and stopped fast you know we
02:52:36.640 have tremendous power in the United
02:52:38.200 States if you know how to use the power
02:52:40.800 I stopped other Wars just by the use of
02:52:42.880 tariffs I got macron of France good gu
02:52:47.000 like a friend of mine but a wise guy and
02:52:50.120 he's a person that likes France and he
02:52:52.479 was going to tax our companies I say you
02:52:54.720 and I sent all the smartest guys I sent
02:52:56.960 manuch and they all failed me and I said
02:52:59.800 I'll do it myself and I called him I
02:53:01.439 said Emanuel you're taxing American
02:53:04.120 companies we're not going to allow you
02:53:05.359 to do that oh Donald I cannot do nothing
02:53:07.960 I could do it's already been passed I
02:53:09.920 said Emanuel if you do that I'm going to
02:53:13.120 put a 100% tariff when your wines and
02:53:15.359 Champagnes are coming to the United
02:53:17.200 States and you're going to regret that
02:53:19.680 you ever did it he said Don please
02:53:21.600 that's not fair anyway within about two
02:53:23.840 minutes he dropped the whole thing it
02:53:25.399 was massive amounts of money against
02:53:27.319 American companies I have to protect
02:53:29.680 American companies so why doesn't the
02:53:31.120 bid Administration do this because
02:53:32.439 they're incompetent they don't know how
02:53:34.040 to talk look they met in
02:53:36.720 Alaska with uh the Chinese and the
02:53:40.960 Chinese lectured them about how badly we
02:53:44.040 treat people right okay I mean think of
02:53:48.319 it
02:53:49.080 you remember that it was like in they
02:53:50.720 didn't talk to me that way they never
02:53:53.160 they respected me they respected our
02:53:55.760 country they don't respect our country
02:53:57.279 they don't respect Biden they don't
02:53:59.760 respect her they're dreaming about her
02:54:03.439 because she's incompetent she's not a
02:54:05.359 smart person look she can't put two
02:54:07.880 sentences together she talks I watched
02:54:10.160 her two nights I watched her last night
02:54:12.439 too was the same thing she's not a smart
02:54:15.200 person these guys are very smart and
02:54:17.560 they're very Street wise and they're
02:54:19.319 very tricky and evil and
02:54:21.960 dangerous and if she
02:54:24.040 becomes the president of the United
02:54:26.160 States which I can't believe can happen
02:54:28.880 uh I don't think this country is going
02:54:30.640 to make it I I don't think we'll ever
02:54:33.279 be I think I think bad just really bad
02:54:36.080 things will happen to our country and
02:54:37.960 you know what I look at the outside
02:54:39.359 forces and I say they can all be handled
02:54:42.120 because we have a pot of gold but we're
02:54:44.200 not going to have that pot of gold to
02:54:45.640 play with anymore you know it's a great
02:54:47.399 negotiating thing
02:54:48.840 I told you I I knocked out this massive
02:54:51.600 car company going to take all of our car
02:54:53.840 business from Detroit I knocked it out
02:54:56.520 just by my rhetoric rhetorically I
02:54:59.200 said they'll never sell a car in here
02:55:01.640 I'll put tariffs I don't care they're
02:55:03.520 2,000% they're never going to build that
02:55:05.640 plant and is it possible to apply that
02:55:07.800 same thing to the electronics that we
02:55:09.439 use one of the things that disturbs me
02:55:11.160 greatly is that all of our phones are
02:55:13.359 made overseas and then some of our
02:55:15.040 phones are made in places like yes and
02:55:17.399 the chips and some of our phones are
02:55:18.680 made in places like foxcon where they
02:55:20.399 have Nets around the building to keep
02:55:21.800 people from jumping off the roof because
02:55:23.439 they have so many suicides like wouldn't
02:55:25.359 it be better to have an americanmade
02:55:27.479 iPhone where you know people are paid
02:55:28.960 good wages they have health insurance
02:55:30.680 they're taken care of they can live a
02:55:32.200 good life where you're not buying a
02:55:34.399 piece of electronics that's cheaper
02:55:36.840 because someone has to suffer a horrible
02:55:39.239 in a horrible way that's not even legal
02:55:40.760 in the United States it's not even legal
02:55:42.600 to have them work that way in the United
02:55:44.200 States so they get these people to build
02:55:45.840 them overseas you do it but but let me
02:55:47.840 just say
02:55:49.080 that chip deal is so bad we put up
02:55:51.399 billions of dollars for Rich companies
02:55:53.160 to come in and borrow the money and
02:55:55.439 build chip companies here and they're
02:55:57.399 not going to give us the good companies
02:55:59.040 anyway all you had to do is charge them
02:56:01.399 tariffs if you were to put a tariff on
02:56:04.279 the chips coming in you would have been
02:56:06.479 able to just like the auto companies no
02:56:08.720 different more sophisticated but no
02:56:11.319 different you know Taiwan they stole our
02:56:14.439 chip
02:56:15.439 business okay they want us to protect
02:56:18.000 and want protection they don't pay us
02:56:19.560 money for the protection you know the
02:56:21.760 mob makes you pay money right but with
02:56:24.720 these countries that we protect I got
02:56:27.239 hundreds of billions of dollars from
02:56:29.479 NATO countries that were never paying us
02:56:32.200 and my biggest fan is stoltenberg who
02:56:33.920 just left as the you know director
02:56:36.800 General as the Secretary General good
02:56:39.920 guy he said Bush came he made a speech
02:56:42.439 Obama came he made a speech Trump came
02:56:44.319 he said you guys aren't paying you got
02:56:45.640 to pay and they said will you protect us
02:56:48.439 from Russia if we don't I said no you
02:56:50.640 got to pay if you don't pay billions of
02:56:52.960 dollars came in to
02:56:55.000 Nato when I see us paying a lot of money
02:56:57.960 to have people build chip that's not the
02:57:00.160 way you didn't have to put up 10 cents
02:57:02.200 you could have done it with a series of
02:57:03.760 tariffs in other words you tariff it's
02:57:05.880 so high that they will come and build
02:57:09.200 their chip companies for nothing in
02:57:11.120 other words Joe you put a big tariff on
02:57:14.200 the chips coming in I say you don't have
02:57:16.840 to pay the Tariff all you have to do was
02:57:18.359 build your plant in the United States we
02:57:20.760 didn't have to give them the money to
02:57:22.040 build the plant besides that they're
02:57:24.560 very rich companies these chip companies
02:57:26.439 they stole they stole
02:57:28.680 95% of our business it's in Taiwan right
02:57:31.880 now they do a great job but that's only
02:57:34.279 because we have stupid politicians we
02:57:35.880 lost the chip business and now we think
02:57:38.279 we're going to pay you can't build it
02:57:40.439 that way you have to make them spend
02:57:43.040 their money in the United States and
02:57:44.640 those plants would open up all over and
02:57:46.439 they'll fund them we don't have to put
02:57:47.560 up 10 cents
02:57:48.840 and I am in the process of making a huge
02:57:51.160 speech in about a little while and you
02:57:53.439 and I how long have we been talking a
02:57:55.080 long time let's go probably like three
02:57:56.840 hours I got to make a speech I but we'll
02:57:59.319 do it again I want to do it again with
02:58:00.880 you you are something they said I said
