00:00:03.360 boom and we're live russell why is it
00:00:05.359 that when people start getting like
00:00:06.640 super spiritual they start dressing like
00:00:09.040 you
00:00:09.760 you dress like a guru we circulate a
00:00:12.480 memo
00:00:13.440 so it's now time to stop wearing socks
00:00:16.000 stop shaving and make eye contact for a
00:00:18.880 bit too long oh it's uncomfortable i
00:00:21.039 can't do that give my [ __ ] staring how
00:00:23.279 long you gonna go with the beard i mean
00:00:24.720 that's that's like you're you're full-on
00:00:26.880 like
00:00:27.680 you're a yogi now i mean it's gone
00:00:29.359 beyond jesus and into moses and lesser
00:00:31.840 prophets or
00:00:33.520 navy seal you're in that range too like
00:00:35.920 you could be some wild man that's that's
00:00:38.399 a mistake that wouldn't
00:00:40.320 like if there was an assault course in
00:00:41.920 front of us that the potential for
00:00:43.920 moving a navy seal would start to break
00:00:45.520 down i once went on a an assault course
00:00:47.760 with some u.s marines in that place near
00:00:50.079 san diego i can't remember the name of
00:00:52.399 that base and climbing up that rope
00:00:54.879 using your leg muscles it was not good
00:00:57.440 value didn't enjoy it
00:00:59.120 i like the camaraderie and i really love
00:01:02.239 like i as i've written about and talk
00:01:04.799 about quite a lot when i'm around very
00:01:06.320 in very male environments i kind of
00:01:08.720 really like it i really get off in it
00:01:10.960 but i have to watch myself not getting
00:01:13.119 too excitable it's even in this
00:01:15.439 environment as a matter of fact i have
00:01:16.880 to keep myself a little bit chilled out
00:01:19.920 what do you mean what does it do to you
00:01:21.200 well i guess what it is is in my early
00:01:22.960 life i grew up mostly around my mum and
00:01:25.439 i don't have brothers and sisters and
00:01:26.799 stuff like that so my
00:01:28.400 male role modeling occurred later in
00:01:30.880 life and i think it probably relates to
00:01:32.479 this spiritual thing i think it meant
00:01:34.320 that i was i'm very open to sort of
00:01:36.640 spiritual experience meditative
00:01:38.799 experience i didn't have a lot of
00:01:40.000 grounding physical experiences or bodily
00:01:42.799 experiences really till adolescence
00:01:44.320 until sex and sexuality that's the first
00:01:46.399 time i really sort of got into the body
00:01:47.920 didn't do sport as a kid didn't have
00:01:49.920 like men going right this is what we do
00:01:51.280 this is how we shave this is how you
00:01:52.640 treat people this is you know i didn't
00:01:54.320 really get that kind of education so now
00:01:56.880 still if i'm around like soldiers
00:01:59.119 ufc fighters i go you know you know i do
00:02:01.520 bjj primarily as a result of these
00:02:04.640 conference that's not called
00:02:06.840 confrontations conversations that's a
00:02:08.878 much nicer term so like there's a bit of
00:02:11.280 me that's the guy get excited about the
00:02:13.360 analysis of it it's not homoerotic
00:02:15.840 because that doesn't happen to be the
00:02:17.599 way that i roll out you just enjoy a
00:02:19.280 little too much there's something about
00:02:21.200 it yeah you get fired up and maybe
00:02:23.840 what's bad about it
00:02:25.440 what's what's bad about getting fired up
00:02:28.400 nothing for me except like you know look
00:02:31.280 my
00:02:32.160 as you know my model for life is a sort
00:02:34.319 of a 12-step model about watching my
00:02:36.800 impulses my impulses have got me in a
00:02:38.640 lot of trouble my impulse is to take
00:02:40.000 drugs my impulses to sleep around my
00:02:42.640 like my impulses to even eat food i've
00:02:45.519 got a sort of a tendency to get
00:02:47.040 obsessive but you know you would
00:02:49.440 probably argue that if you direct that
00:02:51.200 energy correctly it can be kind of
00:02:52.800 positive i think it can but i agree with
00:02:55.519 you that it can get out of control and i
00:02:57.280 have similar impulses i have similar
00:02:59.200 problems and i've just used discipline
00:03:02.560 and hard work especially working out to
00:03:05.040 try to mitigate it well that's what i
00:03:06.640 pick up from you is that your early
00:03:08.480 encounters with martial arts have meant
00:03:11.280 that you've understood from a young age
00:03:13.680 it seems to me physical
00:03:15.599 discipline and i think that's a very
00:03:17.440 important thing and i'm only
00:03:19.360 learning that like now because i've had
00:03:22.720 like you know drugs then fame then and
00:03:25.680 chaos and
00:03:27.120 i've only just emerged from like the
00:03:28.800 sort of the fog of that madness i love
00:03:30.959 how you've emerged though because it's
00:03:32.560 very unique you've you you've uniquely
00:03:34.959 emerged authentically like you this is
00:03:37.680 who you really are like you're not
00:03:38.879 putting on an act you found yourself
00:03:41.360 which is like what everybody wants to do
00:03:42.799 they want to find themselves i mean it
00:03:44.640 never feels like a completed task right
00:03:47.120 it never everyone's a work in progress
00:03:48.799 forever
00:03:49.840 right but you are you like you are very
00:03:52.400 comfortably you and you found what makes
00:03:55.440 you you that's a lovely compliment to
00:03:57.920 get from you joe i appreciate that
00:03:59.439 because what i think about is like
00:04:00.640 you're a very different type of person
00:04:02.080 to me there's things that in this world
00:04:04.000 in these political times you and i would
00:04:06.319 be supposed to i would say
00:04:09.040 take adversarial stances on i'm vegan
00:04:12.400 now you love hunting but my personal
00:04:15.599 philosophy is my morality and my
00:04:17.759 spirituality is for me it's not
00:04:20.160 something i go around inflicting on
00:04:21.839 other people and telling them how they
00:04:23.440 should behave
00:04:24.479 i know enough now to know people are
00:04:26.080 different people have different
00:04:27.199 experiences and i don't let those things
00:04:29.280 get in the way of how i evaluate other
00:04:31.360 people we should all be more like that i
00:04:33.280 really i really believe that i mean
00:04:35.120 there's so many people that i disagree
00:04:36.639 with that i have fine conversations with
00:04:38.560 i don't think there's anything wrong
00:04:39.600 with that and i don't think that impulse
00:04:41.360 to to have
00:04:42.800 antagonistic engagements with people
00:04:44.880 that you disagree with is correct how
00:04:46.639 else are we going to consolidate if like
00:04:48.720 it's just like i'm only going to deal
00:04:49.759 with people that see the world roughly
00:04:51.520 how i do how are we going to
00:04:53.600 form new tribes new alliances new
00:04:55.520 relationships new systems at a time when
00:04:57.600 evidently it feels to me at least joe
00:04:59.440 like things are breaking down yeah
00:05:01.199 there's a lot of
00:05:02.400 bitterness absurdity and confrontation
00:05:04.880 and people don't want to talk to each
00:05:06.000 other i mean i don't know how real that
00:05:07.440 is of actual people i'm talking i
00:05:08.880 suppose about how the media landscape
00:05:11.280 seems to present information i don't
00:05:13.199 know if that's true when you're you know
00:05:14.720 when i'm around people i don't sense oh
00:05:17.360 wow these guys are really tied up in
00:05:19.039 brexit or trump or whatever it doesn't
00:05:20.639 seem that relevant to ordinary people it
00:05:23.360 seems to me that people are still
00:05:25.759 operating on a in a personal how are you
00:05:28.320 today
00:05:29.120 you know people are willing to get on
00:05:30.400 like that i mean how are we supposed to
00:05:31.919 take these ideas on board they're sort
00:05:33.520 of almost too vast for us these
00:05:35.440 geopolitical ideas that we're asked to
00:05:37.280 identify with right and then your
00:05:39.120 everyday life it hardly ever affects you
00:05:41.600 or affects you very little in comparison
00:05:43.680 to things that you ignore because you're
00:05:45.600 concentrating on brexit or you're
00:05:46.960 concentrating on trump or you're
00:05:48.240 concentrating on whatever it is yeah
00:05:51.039 build that wall whatever it is yeah i
00:05:53.199 start to wonder you know who is it
00:05:55.600 that's involved in this stuff i start to
00:05:57.520 what it's where i'm at now is
00:06:01.039 are we even capable of belonging to
00:06:04.240 groups units tribes of 300 million
00:06:08.000 people or 60 million people with so many
00:06:11.039 diverse ideas is this a time to look at
00:06:13.919 federalism differently to start breaking
00:06:16.080 down well you know the i exist within
00:06:18.319 this tribe of people but i collaborate
00:06:20.319 with all these other people i don't know
00:06:21.680 how municipal action gets done i don't
00:06:23.280 know how you run an army and build roads
00:06:24.960 if people are starting to operate in
00:06:26.400 smaller units but
00:06:28.160 i am thinking that we need to have a
00:06:30.240 real sense of community and connection
00:06:32.319 and we've got to let go of looking for
00:06:34.479 ways to object to and judge other people
00:06:37.120 as some sort of primary for way of
00:06:39.199 forming our own identity no i completely
00:06:41.440 agree and i think we're probably moving
00:06:43.440 towards some sort of understanding that
00:06:45.199 a lot of these
00:06:46.639 boundaries and these clans of you know
00:06:49.919 states and countries
00:06:51.919 they were all established without our
00:06:53.360 consent before we were born and we're
00:06:55.280 we're just we're a part of a system that
00:06:57.120 we just were
00:06:58.400 we didn't agree to it we just all of a
00:07:00.960 sudden found ourselves in it and we're
00:07:02.560 trying to make it fit us yeah that's
00:07:04.639 right and there's aspects of it that
00:07:06.720 are appealing you know like sort of
00:07:08.639 during a world cup i really feel english
00:07:12.880 and foreign like i feel a genuine sense
00:07:15.360 of connection and investment
00:07:17.280 but if i'm being asked to live according
00:07:20.319 to rules that don't affect me that
00:07:23.440 except for you know that perfect me
00:07:24.880 financially and don't speak to who i am
00:07:26.560 as an individual then i'm like well what
00:07:28.319 is this this this isn't for my benefit
00:07:31.199 yeah yeah when the the inclination to
00:07:34.479 form teams
00:07:36.639 and to root for your team and a root
00:07:38.319 against other teams it's uh it's so deep
00:07:40.960 seated in us it's so and it can cause so
00:07:43.599 many unnecessary conflicts for no reason
00:07:46.639 it's just it's it's so
00:07:49.199 it's so escapable too it's it's some so
00:07:51.919 if you can objectively analyze the way
00:07:54.479 human beings behave and interact with
00:07:56.319 each other and go well why do we do this
00:07:57.919 let's just stop doing that let's just if
00:08:00.240 we disagree on things how much are these
00:08:02.400 disagreements actually affecting me on a
00:08:04.240 daily basis not that much can we just
00:08:07.120 communicate can someone say what they
00:08:09.440 think and i say what i think and we just
00:08:11.440 decide
00:08:12.560 like what makes sense and what doesn't
00:08:14.240 make sense based on our own
00:08:15.440 interpretations isn't that possible it
00:08:17.520 seems like it's that's the direction
00:08:19.039 we've got ahead in i i did as i know you
00:08:20.879 have done a podcast with candice owens
00:08:23.840 who like on the subject of you know
00:08:26.479 individuals like when she says stuff
00:08:28.160 like uh people should get over slavery
00:08:30.400 or it says if it didn't happen i don't
00:08:31.759 agree with that i feel like that has a
00:08:33.839 massive social impact that is that those
00:08:35.679 statistics are not a coincidence the
00:08:37.360 number of people are certain ethnicities
00:08:40.000 in prisons and in poverty or whatever
00:08:42.000 for me that's not just a coincidence but
00:08:44.560 right so i couldn't agree with her more
00:08:46.240 profoundly on according to social
00:08:48.560 criteria some very very important issues
00:08:50.720 but in a personal level i thought she
00:08:52.480 was absolutely delightful and like so
00:08:54.480 funny and sweet and she's very young if
00:08:57.279 you really start the thing
00:08:58.800 she's only 28
00:09:00.480 which is amazing right is that correct
00:09:04.320 she's so much smarter than i was when i
00:09:06.000 was 28. she's certainly a lot more
00:09:07.600 confident
00:09:08.560 she's prettier too 28 or 29 same thing
00:09:11.760 so
00:09:12.480 when i was 29 i was a [ __ ] [ __ ] okay
00:09:15.200 and no one would ever listen to my
00:09:16.399 opinions on anything in on the world
00:09:18.880 stage yeah people are listening to her i
00:09:20.800 mean she's she's testifying in front of
00:09:23.120 congress i mean she's
00:09:24.720 very so i cut her a lot of slack with
00:09:27.120 some of the things that she's made like
00:09:28.640 missteps on and i think sometimes when
00:09:31.279 people say those things like people
00:09:32.959 should get over slavery it's like
00:09:35.440 it's almost like you're saying things
00:09:37.920 that you think other people want to hear
00:09:40.000 more than you're saying things that are
00:09:41.760 really rational so whether or not we
00:09:43.440 should get over slavery sure slavery was
00:09:45.279 over more than 100 years ago but the
00:09:46.800 repercussions of slavery the echoes of
00:09:49.200 slavery still exist and they exist in
00:09:51.519 all these different southern states and
00:09:53.360 cities and all these different
00:09:54.959 neighborhoods that had been a part of
00:09:56.560 systemic racism where they had literally
00:09:59.519 forced black people to live in certain
00:10:01.360 areas and didn't even allow them to buy
00:10:04.800 homes outside of those areas they made
00:10:06.880 laws and those laws were in place in
00:10:08.959 places like baltimore and you know i had
00:10:11.360 this guy michael wood on
00:10:12.959 who was a police officer
00:10:14.880 in the city of baltimore and one of the
00:10:16.079 more profound things that he said was
00:10:17.920 that they found
00:10:19.600 papers that were documenting crimes from
00:10:22.480 the 1970s in baltimore
00:10:25.040 and they were in this same area the same
00:10:27.360 crimes that he was facing in the 2000s
00:10:30.399 when he was a police officer so he was
00:10:32.399 looking at this going what in the [ __ ]
00:10:34.240 like this is
00:10:35.360 am i just a part of something that's
00:10:37.360 never going to be fixed and never going
00:10:38.640 to be changed and you know as he
00:10:41.519 learned more about the city and the
00:10:43.200 city's laws and how these these
00:10:46.720 systems were set up to keep people in
00:10:49.040 certain places and how the crime and the
00:10:51.839 violence and the drugs is all just in
00:10:53.600 this one concentrated area and it's
00:10:55.120 always been there and no one does
00:10:56.480 anything to change it yeah you realize
00:10:58.640 like wow this is a this is a crazy echo
00:11:01.200 of a horrible past and that's what it is
00:11:03.360 i had a couple of conversations that
00:11:05.360 made me recognize how powerful systems
00:11:07.920 and institutions are and their ability
00:11:10.399 to maintain themselves regardless of any
00:11:13.040 individual because it seems like what
00:11:14.160 happened there with the man you were
00:11:15.440 chatting to is that he's an individual
00:11:17.120 woke up oh my god hold on a second i'm
00:11:19.200 in some sort of weird grid and like i
00:11:21.360 spoke to this fella called ken ross who
00:11:23.360 worked for the british diplomatic
00:11:25.200 service at the time of 9 11 and was
00:11:27.920 privy to confidential information about
00:11:30.000 how that was handled on a military and
00:11:31.839 geopolitical level and he said like he's
00:11:34.480 come away from that thinking well these
00:11:36.720 institutions function and in a totally
00:11:38.959 corrupt way to pursue their own
00:11:40.880 objectives disingenuity and dishonesty
00:11:42.959 is just part of the system and it was
00:11:44.560 him that made me think about anarchism
00:11:46.720 in a different way saying that people
00:11:48.480 the assumption that people if they were
00:11:50.800 not tightly governed with big government
00:11:52.800 and huge control would go around
00:11:54.640 murdering each other and raping each
00:11:56.079 other simply not true that's one of the
00:11:58.720 means by which the state continues to
00:12:00.720 justify its existence people will behave
00:12:03.440 better the closer they are to
00:12:06.480 self-governing community self-governing
00:12:08.560 community and this and i was interested
00:12:09.760 in that because he's talking from this
00:12:11.519 is what i saw on the inside this is how
00:12:13.600 i saw it was running like your cop
00:12:15.680 friend there and like uh
00:12:17.839 another person i spoke to that had been
00:12:20.720 inside a system and then woken up uh
00:12:23.920 within it who was that oh yeah janice
00:12:25.839 varafakis he was when greece had that
00:12:27.680 mad revolution he was like one of the
00:12:29.360 leaders of a party syriza and for a
00:12:31.279 minute it was like syriza said we ain't
00:12:32.880 paying back all those debts you screwed
00:12:34.560 us financially you screwed greece so he
00:12:36.560 was there at the eu meetings telling
00:12:38.880 like the german chancellery we're not
00:12:42.000 greece ain't going to repay those debts
00:12:44.000 and he just said that the way that the
00:12:45.279 system reasserted itself was magnificent
00:12:48.480 to watch in a way and he said none of
00:12:49.920 those individuals have any power except
00:12:51.839 the power that that role gives them if
00:12:53.600 you are the german finance minister
00:12:56.480 you've got the power that a german
00:12:57.760 finance minister has you can't step
00:12:59.279 outside it and start going right listen
00:13:00.639 why don't we do this and why don't we do
00:13:01.839 that the system itself resp is beyond
00:13:04.399 individual decisions you know it's a
00:13:06.760 self-sustaining system it won't come up
00:13:08.800 with ideas or support ideas that
00:13:11.040 threaten it and that's why i continually
00:13:13.040 keep hearing and i'm sure you're having
00:13:14.160 similar conversations that if you are
00:13:15.920 really interested in changing the world
00:13:17.360 you have to participate in systems that
00:13:18.880 are outside of it set up new ideas don't
00:13:21.440 worry about trying to smash this one
00:13:22.959 down with a hammer it will atrophy on
00:13:25.519 its own as it becomes less and less
00:13:27.200 relevant i think also change yourself
00:13:29.760 and when you change yourself becomes
00:13:31.200 evident to the people around you and if
00:13:33.760 your change is beneficial and attractive
00:13:37.279 people they gravitate towards
00:13:40.079 that idea that you can improve yourself
00:13:42.240 and you can you change your perspective
00:13:44.480 on things well that is
00:13:46.560 the one area of your life where you've
00:13:48.240 got some authority in control and that's
00:13:50.560 yeah that is what i'm about it's like
00:13:52.399 well i can stop myself
00:13:54.880 being
00:13:56.079 like a watching pornography i can stop
00:13:58.639 myself using drugs if i want to like you
00:14:01.040 know with some support and that's what
00:14:03.040 that this book here mentors which i talk
00:14:04.880 about you in only for a paragraph you
00:14:06.800 know i mean it's not too it's not like
00:14:08.399 uh like literary fellatio it's just a
00:14:11.279 small nod of your uh like of your
00:14:13.920 influence and impact
00:14:15.440 i talk about how
00:14:17.040 we have late and latent qualities within
00:14:19.920 us that are sometimes hard to realize on
00:14:23.040 on without support
00:14:25.279 but if you find a mentor in an area
00:14:27.519 where you're looking to improve they can
00:14:30.800 kind of energize awaken energies within
00:14:34.240 you that on your own you wouldn't be
00:14:36.480 able to use i had a really recent
00:14:38.720 experience of it where i was sort of
00:14:39.680 like freaking out about something i
00:14:41.120 spoke to like a mentor of mine and like
00:14:43.920 the way that he sort of spoke to me was
00:14:46.000 like sort of aggressive like a sort of
00:14:47.760 an aggressive that's not going to happen
00:14:49.360 you are not afraid and like it sort of
00:14:51.040 it woke up the part of me that feels
00:14:53.680 that way that has that kind of i would
00:14:55.600 say sort of uh male
00:14:58.480 certainty a kind of grounded energy he
00:15:01.040 was able to sort of like direct it at me
00:15:03.040 and like in that moment in myself all
00:15:04.800 bewildered i wasn't able to do it you
00:15:06.880 know i needed to resource it externally
00:15:08.800 in a moment
00:15:10.000 so this is how i sort of feel like your
00:15:12.000 individual journey i'm interested in how
00:15:14.720 because i'm guessing with your
00:15:15.760 background in martial arts and stuff
00:15:17.600 mentorship seems pretty much stitched
00:15:19.839 into that you must continually be
00:15:21.199 looking at someone learning from someone
00:15:23.120 yeah trying to equal them or whatever it
00:15:25.680 is yeah the good part about that is you
00:15:27.519 get good at learning things you get good
00:15:29.120 at listening you know uh as a martial
00:15:31.680 arts student you you don't just listen
00:15:34.480 you listen very intently you bow you say
00:15:36.959 sir
00:15:37.839 you know i mean there's there's so much
00:15:40.800 discipline involved in the the the act
00:15:44.079 of learning yeah and so much reverence
00:15:46.320 and respect for people who know more
00:15:47.519 than you and appreciation so uh that
00:15:49.920 that helped me with pretty much
00:15:51.040 everything i ever wanted to learn i just
00:15:52.720 would listen very intently i don't think
00:15:55.279 maybe i could figure it out better i
00:15:57.040 will i'm very good at listening to
00:15:58.560 people that are good at things
00:16:00.079 that's interesting did you first get
00:16:02.240 into
00:16:03.440 uh like you know i've picked up stuff
00:16:04.959 over
00:16:05.839 the various shows of yours that i've
00:16:07.920 listened to but would you say that your
00:16:10.680 inaugural interest in martial arts came
00:16:14.079 from kind of domestic distress and stuff
00:16:16.720 you're having a difficult home life and
00:16:18.240 not a good relationship with your
00:16:19.120 stepdad am i right it was that but it
00:16:20.959 was it was also move moving more than
00:16:22.959 anything i mean i missed stepped as a
00:16:24.399 nice guy um but it was stepped out it's
00:16:27.519 always a weird situation you know no one
00:16:29.759 likes the dynamic of someone having sex
00:16:32.240 with their mother i remember
00:16:34.160 having similar feelings about my own
00:16:36.720 step that wasn't a great guy though i
00:16:38.480 don't want to like not of course paying
00:16:40.000 them in a bad way it's just what was
00:16:42.000 really hard was moving a lot and running
00:16:44.240 into bullies that was way harder than
00:16:46.079 anything else so there was a time in
00:16:47.839 your life where you felt very presumably
00:16:50.399 vulnerable yeah and not grounded didn't
00:16:52.480 have any friends constantly moving in
00:16:54.160 new neighborhoods meeting new people
00:16:56.880 and uh you know and when you're a young
00:16:58.959 boy you're a teenage boy teenage boys
00:17:00.959 are [ __ ] dangerous yeah they're the
00:17:02.320 worst they're the worst if you see a
00:17:03.920 group of them now i'm talking about my
00:17:05.599 country 13 14 years old are
00:17:08.240 across the street yeah they're lawless
00:17:10.880 well young boys are just they're always
00:17:12.959 looking to impress each other and they
00:17:14.959 they have these if you want to find real
00:17:17.199 toxic masculinity it exists in teenage
00:17:19.919 boys yeah and it's mostly exaggerated in
00:17:22.400 men
00:17:24.000 the way it's described is mostly
00:17:25.359 exaggerated in terms of the way the
00:17:26.720 media talks about it but in its purest
00:17:28.720 form and teenage boys they get together
00:17:30.400 and they start lighting frogs on fire
00:17:32.400 and doing [ __ ] they do things because
00:17:34.559 they want to like one-up each other and
00:17:36.400 they feed off of each other like what
00:17:39.120 one boy would do is so different than
00:17:41.600 what five boys would do what five boys
00:17:43.840 would do could be horrific but what one
00:17:46.080 boy would do on his own is very rarely
00:17:48.240 there because what you know you have to
00:17:49.840 think about yourself and think about is
00:17:51.520 this right and
00:17:53.039 you objectively analyze the way you're
00:17:55.120 behaving and like um yeah people
00:17:57.440 wouldn't be proud of me if i did it this
00:17:58.799 way but when you're with five other boys
00:18:00.960 and you're you're all rambunctious and
00:18:03.039 filled with testosterone and piss and
00:18:04.720 vinegar you wind up doing crazy things
00:18:07.360 this is i you know when i hear something
00:18:09.440 like that it's difficult to think that
00:18:11.200 it's of course relative relative to us
00:18:13.679 the behavior of
00:18:15.039 adolescent mouse is reckless and crazy
00:18:18.000 it's not impossible to conceive of an
00:18:20.240 intelligence that would look at the
00:18:21.760 behavior of adult human beings and think
00:18:24.240 oh my god what are what's governing
00:18:26.799 these people what principles are they
00:18:28.960 using right now like what's the end goal
00:18:31.120 too like what are you trying to
00:18:32.080 accomplish with your life with your
00:18:34.000 existence with your time i think if
00:18:35.840 there's a real concern about ai
00:18:38.559 i think the real concern is ai is going
00:18:40.240 to rationally analyze our behavior
00:18:42.640 and our
00:18:44.000 reliance on emotions
00:18:45.840 and all these human reward systems that
00:18:48.080 we have built in the way it's affecting
00:18:49.760 our society and the way it's affecting
00:18:51.919 how we govern ourselves and how we
00:18:53.600 behave amongst ourselves and it's going
00:18:55.840 to think
00:18:57.200 we're unfixable it's going to look at it
00:18:58.960 like well this is they have too much
00:19:00.799 monkey in them they have so much monkey
00:19:03.360 instincts and monkey dna but now they
00:19:05.360 live in this rational modern world of
00:19:08.880 you know 5g internet on your phone and
00:19:11.919 satellite communication and 24 7 news
00:19:15.039 cycle but yet they have these
00:19:17.520 primate genes
00:19:19.200 artificial intelligence a subject about
00:19:21.200 which i know very little
00:19:23.520 it seems to me that it will on some
00:19:25.280 level
00:19:26.240 have to be derived from a particular
00:19:28.480 aspect of human understanding of
00:19:30.640 rationalism so we're representing one
00:19:33.120 aspect of our nature and prioritizing it
00:19:35.840 logic uh organization
00:19:38.480 but what you refer to as sort of
00:19:41.039 primitive and monkey-ish for me it
00:19:44.720 envelops and involves the most beautiful
00:19:47.520 aspects of our nature i'm a little
00:19:50.640 romantic about human beings still i
00:19:53.520 still feel that i feel that one of the
00:19:56.240 great problems we've had is that
00:19:57.600 philosophically we have overvalued
00:20:00.240 materialism rationalism and like you
00:20:02.720 know knowing a little bit about
00:20:03.840 philosophy primarily from that bloody
00:20:05.679 podcast that you and i tagged a minute
00:20:07.840 ago before we was recording who
00:20:09.679 classifies this so like what
00:20:12.240 what i understand for that is that post
00:20:13.760 enlightenment we've started to
00:20:15.360 prioritize rationalism so if you
00:20:17.120 prioritize rationalism and organization
00:20:19.039 which obviously has a lot to offer the
00:20:20.559 organization of resources is incredibly
00:20:22.480 and hugely important you forget that a
00:20:24.880 huge part of the human experience is
00:20:27.039 nothing to do with that the other thing
00:20:28.720 we were chatting about before we went
00:20:30.640 live was dmt now no artificial
00:20:33.520 intelligence is going to understand that
00:20:35.520 there is access to a realm of
00:20:37.760 consciousness that continually exists
00:20:41.120 that doesn't seem to be bound by
00:20:43.039 physical laws as we understand them and
00:20:45.200 if the physical laws that we abide by
00:20:47.600 are parochial and relevant only to this
00:20:50.000 level of existence
00:20:51.679 why are we allowing ideas resourced from
00:20:54.559 there to govern all of our systems you
00:20:56.960 know even listen to you talk about the
00:20:58.720 mt and you know i encountered these
00:21:00.320 gestures their gestures i went through
00:21:02.799 this membrane into another realm and
00:21:05.360 checking out mike tyson when he was on
00:21:07.120 here no no no yeah i love that that
00:21:09.840 moment was amazing
00:21:12.320 like
00:21:13.200 like like that clearly like you know i
00:21:15.679 only i took acid when i was a teenager
00:21:18.159 and even in very unhealthy not unhealthy
00:21:21.520 but i'm bridled mad teenage boy
00:21:23.760 conditions i you know i want to be there
00:21:25.280 with a guy in a lab coat with a pen
00:21:26.799 going well mr brown sit down look at
00:21:28.480 these raw tests instead of which i mean
00:21:31.039 new cross in a bed sit dropping acid and
00:21:34.080 staring at my own hands and recognizing
00:21:36.000 oh my god i'm not me the very idea of me
00:21:38.559 is a construct i'm just tuned into a
00:21:40.640 particular aspect ai will build systems
00:21:44.240 that are that are predicated on
00:21:46.400 rationalism organization and i on on
00:21:49.440 that basis i can see why they would at
00:21:50.720 some point yeah go off skynet and
00:21:52.720 annihilate us but that is
00:21:55.919 i believe the problem with our society
00:21:58.159 is that the materialistic aspect of our
00:22:00.320 nature is not the priority it's just one
00:22:03.039 thing we should be doing of course we
00:22:04.400 need good roads because we need
00:22:05.760 hospitals schools food etc but we need
00:22:08.559 to find a way of honoring the sacred and
00:22:10.880 i'm fascinated in the experiences you're
00:22:13.120 having in these psychedelic explorations
00:22:16.240 and how it's influencing the rest of
00:22:18.080 your life like how you're saying like
00:22:20.000 how you're how does it influence the
00:22:21.919 rest of your decisions the way you see
00:22:23.760 the world the way you see relationships
00:22:25.120 the way you see the vulnerable young man
00:22:26.799 you were prior to building your own i
00:22:29.679 say personal religion of martial arts
00:22:32.799 excellence in your chosen field of
00:22:34.640 stand-up comedy how do you
00:22:36.880 incorporate that vulnerable kid because
00:22:38.720 i'm still very aware of the vulnerable
00:22:40.320 person i was and like i'm going on a
00:22:42.240 rant man
00:22:43.280 um like when kevin hart was on here who
00:22:45.200 i think is amazing and he was amazing on
00:22:47.440 this i thought [ __ ] hell like what
00:22:49.760 have i got to offer the world when kevin
00:22:51.600 hart has got this kind of force like you
00:22:55.039 don't come in the bubble and i was like
00:22:56.640 my god this guy's so positive what a
00:22:59.039 role model what a lot he's got to offer
00:23:01.120 and then i thought well like any of us
00:23:02.960 what i've got to offer is who i am just
00:23:05.360 who i am as a vulnerable flawed human
00:23:07.840 being that still feels connected to the
00:23:09.679 kid i was when i didn't feel good enough
00:23:11.440 i still feel that i can walk in a room
00:23:13.679 and feel that but i also know that
00:23:15.600 that's that's not real because i've had
00:23:17.600 spiritual experiences hallucigenic
00:23:19.679 experiences that make me feel that the
00:23:22.159 relationships we should be building have
00:23:24.400 to honor that we are both we're
00:23:26.720 vulnerable and flawed but also capable
00:23:28.880 of greatness there has to be room for
00:23:30.320 all of this and i feel that part of what
00:23:31.919 we're doing and part of why we're
00:23:32.880 experiencing such superficial polarity
00:23:35.120 in politics and culture is because we're
00:23:37.200 not acknowledging that underneath this
00:23:39.039 surface activity of left right left
00:23:41.120 right and you know from sam harris them
00:23:43.120 little experiments you stick garbage in
00:23:44.799 front of someone they become republican
00:23:47.120 pretty quickly or you know you scare
00:23:48.880 people they become less democratic you
00:23:50.720 know i think all that stuff is pretty
00:23:52.159 superficial and at depth in that realm
00:23:54.720 of the jesters and the membrane of
00:23:56.799 psychedelia we have access to oneness
00:23:59.440 and that should be what's influencing
00:24:00.880 the way we set up our tribes our systems
00:24:02.480 and our relationships yeah i think when
00:24:04.480 a guy like kevin hart shows you what a a
00:24:07.760 positive and motivational uh
00:24:10.799 impact
00:24:11.919 one person can have
00:24:13.760 just with his words and his deeds and
00:24:15.440 the way he lives his life
00:24:17.279 he's so inspirational
00:24:19.039 that you realize uh that that that is
00:24:22.000 possible that you you can share that
00:24:24.320 energy and that you can have these
00:24:26.400 experiences
00:24:27.760 with people where they literally do
00:24:29.679 actually they actually uplift you like i
00:24:32.000 like was uplifted by his conversation i
00:24:34.559 felt like wow that guy is so positive
00:24:37.039 what a great way to look at the life
00:24:38.640 that we're living and the more people do
00:24:41.600 that the better and when someone like
00:24:43.200 that does
00:24:44.799 spread a positive message
00:24:46.640 you know and obviously he's got he's
00:24:49.120 materialistic as well he's got a bunch
00:24:50.799 of cars in a big house and he makes a
00:24:52.559 lot of money and he does a lot of movies
00:24:54.159 but
00:24:54.880 what he's spreading is this
00:24:57.919 very motivational very positive message
00:25:01.039 and that affects people in a very
00:25:02.559 positive way too and
00:25:04.320 all that left right [ __ ] and all this
00:25:06.880 the all the the battles that we have
00:25:08.720 politically and ideologically back and
00:25:11.279 forth and all the negative venom that
00:25:13.120 people spray at each other
00:25:14.880 at the end of the day this is not
00:25:17.200 benefiting anyone unless you're fighting
00:25:19.200 some a major demon that the world needs
00:25:21.520 to conquer
00:25:22.880 and most of the most of it's not that
00:25:24.799 most of it is like finding demons out of
00:25:27.039 innocuous things
00:25:28.559 you know and i think
00:25:30.559 when you talk about what what you have
00:25:33.039 to offer what you have to offer is
00:25:35.600 that you are you that you have this
00:25:37.200 unique perspective you you can affect
00:25:40.080 the way people view their own journey in
00:25:42.559 life because you've been so
00:25:44.159 introspective and so aware of your own
00:25:48.640 pros and cons in terms of your past
00:25:51.360 behavior your current behavior and who
00:25:53.520 you are now and who you used to be all
00:25:55.919 that stuff is fuel for people because
00:25:57.840 they can relate they hear it i mean
00:25:59.200 maybe they cannot relate to being a
00:26:00.559 movie star and being this famous guy and
00:26:02.880 this truck but they can relate to the
00:26:04.400 humanity of your struggle they put
00:26:06.240 themselves in your position like what
00:26:07.919 must that have been like and look at
00:26:09.760 this guy who's made these conscious
00:26:11.120 decisions to not be like that anymore he
00:26:13.520 dresses like a homeless person with a
00:26:14.960 crazy beard
00:26:16.640 that's the real take-home information
00:26:19.200 dress like you live out of doors
00:26:21.760 yeah just like you're a homeless guy in
00:26:23.760 oregon
00:26:24.250 [Laughter]
00:26:26.080 specifically there people respect that
00:26:28.159 yeah it's like dark colors you know it
00:26:29.919 rains a lot yeah yeah i get it i get the
00:26:32.159 reference i understand american culture
00:26:34.240 joe rogan yeah so um hey can i do some
00:26:38.080 like promotional productivity tell me
00:26:40.080 what it's called what is it this book is
00:26:41.360 called mentors and actually i like i
00:26:44.159 read it bits of it again because i knew
00:26:45.840 i was coming here and i think it's
00:26:47.279 actually pretty good like
00:26:49.440 i wrote quite a lot about brazilian
00:26:51.760 jiu-jitsu you really love it huh yeah i
00:26:54.159 do my writing is not from a you'll
00:26:56.000 understand not from a technical
00:26:57.919 perspective i'm not saying this is what
00:26:59.279 i've got to say on open guard
00:27:02.240 to transition i'm talking about how the
00:27:04.320 psychological impact that it's had on me
00:27:07.520 and also in there about like the
00:27:09.520 protocols of going to a group which as a
00:27:11.279 beginner are very relevant like you
00:27:12.880 touched on how ritualized it is i've got
00:27:15.679 a hunch that the more we emulate and
00:27:18.000 connect to original ways of human
00:27:20.480 behavior whether that's dietary or
00:27:23.039 hierarchies or organization of groups i
00:27:27.039 feel that we will
00:27:28.960 feel a sense of greater connection now
00:27:30.880 the thing i got from the gundam bjj
00:27:32.880 class classes genesis where i go in back
00:27:35.039 in england it's like that all the white
00:27:37.440 belts get changed at one end of the room
00:27:39.760 the purple belts and above get changed
00:27:41.600 at the other end of the room which
00:27:42.799 coincidentally or not is where the
00:27:44.720 control for the timer is and the control
00:27:46.880 for the music is and where the kit is
00:27:49.200 that's all up that rooms at end of the
00:27:51.039 room so all the control is that end but
00:27:53.279 it begins with sort of dancing around in
00:27:55.440 a circle doing all of those various
00:27:57.120 exercises now lift your knees now do the
00:27:59.200 shrimping and that kind of stuff is that
00:28:01.520 a lower belt shouldn't invite a higher
00:28:04.000 belt to
00:28:05.440 spa or roll you know it's and like as
00:28:08.159 you say the amount of respect the bowing
00:28:10.399 the handshaking at the end of it it's so
00:28:13.360 sort of it provides such a safe
00:28:15.600 environment in which to deal with the
00:28:18.399 primal i can see why it's valuable and
00:28:21.600 it's like you know i should have been
00:28:23.440 taught that [ __ ] when i was 14 13 like
00:28:26.000 it was mandatorily so that i didn't come
00:28:28.399 across it like you know you're not going
00:28:30.159 to be setting fire to fields and
00:28:32.159 allotments and putting frogs on
00:28:33.840 fireworks if you've got a way of dealing
00:28:36.080 with that primal energy yeah when when
00:28:38.799 it's coming some people that don't
00:28:40.640 understand that think that you should
00:28:41.679 suppress it somehow you should just
00:28:43.440 ignore it or suppress it they don't
00:28:44.960 understand that
00:28:45.919 for men it really if you're a biological
00:28:47.919 male it really needs to be tackled head
00:28:50.000 on i mean you really you really need to
00:28:51.919 and
00:28:52.799 embrace
00:28:53.840 what it is to be a physical male and it
00:28:56.399 frees you in a lot of ways do you think
00:28:58.000 this might be a comparable moment to in
00:28:59.760 the 1960s when there was a sort of a
00:29:01.440 sense of sexual repression versus sexual
00:29:04.240 free love you know the images of
00:29:05.679 woodstock and flowers in their hair and
00:29:07.200 smoking joints and having sort of sex
00:29:09.039 outdoors in mud or possibly wheat that
00:29:12.399 that that this time of like a kind of an
00:29:15.600 anger about maleness you know and and
00:29:18.159 malnus may not as you said it may be a
00:29:20.000 biological male but it could be the
00:29:21.760 energy of i don't know assertion or
00:29:24.559 whatever these like you know as in
00:29:26.159 grammar
00:29:27.120 male and female relate to certain words
00:29:29.279 as in french grammar where i don't know
00:29:31.039 cat is female and dog is male i don't
00:29:32.799 know the system i don't speak french but
00:29:34.240 i'm saying that these we have labelled
00:29:36.399 these energies and it does seem that uh
00:29:39.120 that there is a particular
00:29:41.440 what i want to say a condemnation of
00:29:44.240 male energy do you think you think it
00:29:46.159 comes from a misunderstanding yeah and i
00:29:48.000 also think it comes from a big
00:29:49.200 generalization too yes it's easy to do
00:29:51.600 right and if you're a woman who's had
00:29:53.120 negative experiences with men maybe
00:29:55.039 you've dated men that have been
00:29:56.080 physically abusive or maybe you've known
00:29:58.399 men that have been physically abusive
00:29:59.919 and you you're around that
00:30:02.159 and you just uh it's it's very
00:30:03.919 convenient and very easy to just
00:30:06.080 generalize and decide that all men are
00:30:07.679 negative
00:30:09.120 masculine energy is negative and
00:30:10.960 especially white males and if you say
00:30:12.880 that you'll get props online people go
00:30:15.120 yes girl yes clap clap clap people get
00:30:17.600 excited but those are also people that
00:30:19.200 are short-sighted like you want to make
00:30:20.720 as many people your ally as you can you
00:30:22.559 want to make as many people your friend
00:30:23.840 as you can and you have to understand
00:30:25.360 that there's some people that are just
00:30:26.640 wired different than you there's some
00:30:28.159 there's some girly girls and there's
00:30:30.559 some really feminine men and then
00:30:32.720 there's some masculine men and then
00:30:34.320 every and but everybody is okay as long
00:30:36.960 as they respect you and they're kind to
00:30:38.559 each other but the problem is we
00:30:40.559 associate certain behaviors and
00:30:42.640 characteristics with either negativity
00:30:45.039 or hedonism or uh
00:30:47.760 toxic masculinity or someone being a
00:30:51.120 [ __ ] as a man and
00:30:53.360 that's
00:30:54.240 these generalizations are often way more
00:30:56.880 harmful and just it's just too
00:30:58.960 convenient and easy and lazy yeah there
00:31:01.440 is no simple way and when i think about
00:31:03.360 my own attitudes in this area there is a
00:31:05.520 degree of complexity because i've got
00:31:06.960 young daughters i've got a two-year-old
00:31:09.600 and a one-year-old right and they're you
00:31:11.919 know daughters so like but when the
00:31:13.840 other day because i'm staying in los
00:31:15.840 angeles gabby she's mexican she used to
00:31:18.080 when i first moved out here and lived my
00:31:19.919 entourage lifestyle she used to look
00:31:22.159 after the house and she used to think oh
00:31:23.760 my baby my baby she loved me so and i'd
00:31:26.080 like i'll take a matriarchal figure
00:31:27.919 wherever i can find one and gabby used
00:31:29.279 to look after me she adored me and stuff
00:31:30.799 i stayed friends with her yesterday she
00:31:32.159 come around she bought like uh
00:31:34.720 like what i can only describe as a
00:31:36.000 bikini for like my baby daughter like
00:31:38.960 what a two-year-old doesn't need like
00:31:41.279 like a bikini like top and i excuse me
00:31:44.159 burping on the mic i like it for me i
00:31:46.399 thought i don't want to put my daughter
00:31:48.159 in that that's sort of in a way
00:31:50.159 sexualizing the like that child and like
00:31:53.519 coming so and also a lot of the time
00:31:55.519 like with my daughter i don't like with
00:31:57.519 my wife particularly my first child i'm
00:31:59.440 like don't dress her up in little
00:32:00.720 dresses and stuff because she won't be
00:32:02.320 able to like run around and i thought my
00:32:03.840 god i'm not that's not that different
00:32:05.039 from like the cliche of a male parent
00:32:08.159 that wanted a son and i didn't want a
00:32:10.320 son or you know in particular i love
00:32:12.000 this kid i love this kid regard you know
00:32:14.159 it doesn't mean i love having a daughter
00:32:15.840 adore her but like i am aware that
00:32:19.600 these things of like dress a child this
00:32:21.919 way dress a girl this way our constructs
00:32:24.000 further to what we were talking about
00:32:25.200 again before about michelle foucault we
00:32:26.559 got a lot done before we went live man
00:32:28.240 like when we were talking about michelle
00:32:29.519 foucault what he exposes a lot is that
00:32:31.519 there and uh deluge guild the lose is
00:32:34.960 that a lot of things that we take for
00:32:36.240 granted as being normal are actually
00:32:38.320 constructs and when i say a child's
00:32:40.480 bikini i think there's no reason for any
00:32:43.039 child of any sex or gender to be wearing
00:32:45.279 a bloody bikini so a child with tits is
00:32:48.720 a terrifying idea
00:32:50.960 for all but a very small and terrifying
00:32:52.960 percentage of the population so like
00:32:55.120 that is an example of the external
00:32:57.760 feminization of a child like so when
00:33:00.000 there's an argument a feminist argument
00:33:01.919 of you know gender is a construct i can
00:33:04.080 see oh yeah to a point it is there is
00:33:07.200 there are constructs kind of like my
00:33:09.039 opinion is you can't argue with biology
00:33:10.960 chromosomes are doing what they're doing
00:33:12.399 in the physical realm
00:33:14.000 but like uh i you know like being a
00:33:16.399 father to a daughter has made me feel
00:33:19.279 like i don't obviously and i know you
00:33:21.360 have daughters or at least eight or
00:33:23.120 three three daughters like like i'm
00:33:25.360 certainly very aware of i don't want to
00:33:27.679 push them down some culturally
00:33:29.440 prescribed avenue whether it's about
00:33:31.039 their dress their sexuality or anything
00:33:32.960 so i've got you know where do i where am
00:33:34.720 i on that dial you know yeah you gotta
00:33:38.080 just not put any pressure on them and
00:33:41.120 let them enjoy their life and let them
00:33:43.120 find their path that's what that's
00:33:44.799 what's weird right it's like i see
00:33:46.480 people
00:33:47.519 they're
00:33:48.559 you know they're getting their their
00:33:49.919 daughters to dress very very feminine
00:33:52.480 with little mini skirts and stuff and
00:33:54.080 they're five years old and high heeled
00:33:56.320 shoes i've seen little kids with high
00:33:57.679 heel shoes his name is very strange to
00:33:59.840 me i don't like it yeah well so you know
00:34:02.480 but for me that is being sourced from
00:34:04.720 like can't we can extrapolate that to
00:34:06.720 well then why should a 20 year old woman
00:34:08.800 wear high heels i mean i've read
00:34:10.480 cultural analysis i'm sure you have like
00:34:12.719 well the
00:34:13.679 lipstick is to emphasize the lips
00:34:15.440 because it's
00:34:16.560 red of the vagina the high heels is to
00:34:19.760 make a woman seem more vulnerable and to
00:34:21.679 accentuate aspects of body shape now
00:34:23.679 this can be you know seen as evidence of
00:34:25.760 the influence of patriarchy you know
00:34:27.679 there's loads of areas where i feel like
00:34:29.359 why are we looking for [ __ ] to argue
00:34:30.639 about in this area we're just human
00:34:31.918 beings most of us
00:34:33.440 the most important people in our life
00:34:35.040 are of the of the diff of a different
00:34:36.960 gender or sex to us you know why we're
00:34:39.040 looking for arguments but i can you can
00:34:41.440 see the influence of cultural forces
00:34:44.560 that are
00:34:45.760 you know not neutral yeah you certainly
00:34:48.000 can but i think it should be up to the
00:34:49.599 choice of the person once they're an
00:34:51.199 adult the real problem is putting
00:34:52.879 pressure on them to dress one way or
00:34:54.320 another and not letting them find their
00:34:56.320 place but if a woman becomes you know
00:34:58.480 whatever age you decide and she wants to
00:35:00.880 wear high heels and a skirt because she
00:35:02.240 likes the way it looks like there's
00:35:03.440 nothing wrong with that either
00:35:05.680 our
00:35:07.040 the demonization of sexuality is also a
00:35:09.440 problem you know yes
00:35:11.520 it is
00:35:12.560 almost as much of a problem as
00:35:15.599 people who will prey upon vulnerable
00:35:17.760 people the the people
00:35:19.920 people that think there's something
00:35:21.520 wrong with being sexually attractive or
00:35:23.359 something wrong with being desirable or
00:35:25.280 wanting to be desirable there's nothing
00:35:27.040 wrong with that either and that kind of
00:35:28.240 suppression the suppression of the these
00:35:31.119 feelings that you have and this desire
00:35:32.640 that you have is very unhealthy as well
00:35:34.800 it's a normal thing to want to be sexual
00:35:37.440 it's a normal thing to want to look good
00:35:39.040 if a girl looks good in a skirt a skirt
00:35:41.440 in high heels and she likes to dress
00:35:42.960 like that who the [ __ ] is anyone to say
00:35:45.359 there's anything wrong with that there's
00:35:46.880 nothing wrong with it it's if that's
00:35:48.800 what she likes that's fine which isn't
00:35:50.720 what's interesting to me is
00:35:53.359 particularly
00:35:54.720 in really progressive ideology
00:35:57.359 they look down upon women who wear
00:36:01.440 short skirts and high heels and a lot of
00:36:04.480 makeup and you know open tops that show
00:36:07.359 their boobs because they think that it's
00:36:09.359 they're playing into the patriarchy or
00:36:11.760 that they're somehow or another falling
00:36:14.240 into these gender traps
00:36:16.320 but yet they celebrate that in
00:36:18.079 transgender people
00:36:19.599 they celebrate that in trans men that
00:36:22.079 transition to women and then they they
00:36:24.079 they really doll it up and then they're
00:36:25.680 like you go girl then they're
00:36:27.359 celebrating the fact that this person is
00:36:29.119 embracing these traditional aspects of
00:36:31.440 womanhood like you see that a lot with
00:36:34.160 you know people that are
00:36:35.760 celebrating trans women so i find very
00:36:38.880 fascinating the aesthetics of uh the
00:36:41.839 sort of what would be perhaps could be
00:36:43.680 referred to as a sexualized dress or
00:36:47.280 like a i suppose in males expressio
00:36:50.079 expressive or garish clothing jewelry
00:36:52.560 tattoos in i understand in british
00:36:55.200 culture that these are often indicators
00:36:57.200 of class that like that it's typically
00:37:00.720 the lower down the class structure you
00:37:03.520 are the more likely you are to dress in
00:37:05.440 a way that is exhibitive or like you
00:37:08.240 know women
00:37:09.359 from a blue collar background dress in
00:37:11.760 ways that are exposing and revealing men
00:37:13.599 have leary cars and lots of tattoos and
00:37:16.320 jewelry expressive ways of demonstrating
00:37:19.119 wealth the higher you go up the class
00:37:20.560 the more subtle the more dressed down no
00:37:22.800 labels all that stuff stuff like you
00:37:24.560 know so in british culture there's a
00:37:26.160 different system of like a different
00:37:28.079 system for referencing it i wonder how
00:37:29.680 that works in american culture with it
00:37:32.000 sort of like it's evident and much
00:37:33.920 discussed racial divisions like certain
00:37:36.480 things it seems like a subtle way of
00:37:39.599 condemning particular types of womanhood
00:37:42.240 that may not just be sourced from
00:37:44.480 dressed this way for the male gaze it
00:37:46.880 can also be a way of saying dressing
00:37:48.320 that way is an indication of a lower
00:37:50.160 class background or of a particular type
00:37:52.400 of ethnicity
00:37:55.200 but there's also
00:37:56.400 the reality of males and females is
00:37:58.640 there's a lot of [ __ ] jealous people
00:38:00.480 and there's a lot of women that just
00:38:02.000 don't have the type of physical body
00:38:04.720 that looks good
00:38:06.240 in a short skirt with high heels and you
00:38:08.800 know a low-cut shirt and they don't like
00:38:12.240 when they see it in other women because
00:38:13.680 they don't they're not comfortable with
00:38:14.960 their own bodies there's a reality of
00:38:16.880 that i mean women get as much or more
00:38:18.960 hate from women as they ever do for men
00:38:21.200 and particularly if women find you to be
00:38:24.079 too uh
00:38:25.359 overtly sexual with the way you dress or
00:38:28.160 behave that you are you're you know
00:38:30.079 you're damaging male female
00:38:32.400 relationships you're damaging the
00:38:34.000 dynamic particular office dynamics if
00:38:36.320 there's one girl in the office that
00:38:37.680 likes to [ __ ] it up you know and she's
00:38:39.839 uh
00:38:40.640 and all the guys are paying attention to
00:38:42.160 her women will get mad at her i um did
00:38:44.880 an interview a while ago where i sort of
00:38:46.400 talked about like parenting our kids me
00:38:48.880 and my wife how we parent our kids and i
00:38:50.400 said like uh you know guys i have to be
00:38:52.560 honest my wife is much the more dominant
00:38:55.520 parent she's much more practical than i
00:38:58.000 am right and like stuff that got that
00:39:00.079 got like really negatively written about
00:39:02.079 people said like like oh she changes
00:39:03.440 more diapers than i do and stuff right
00:39:05.680 but i look not like i don't change
00:39:07.839 diapers or whatever it's just my wife
00:39:09.839 you know regardless of our respective
00:39:12.320 sexes is the more efficient dominant
00:39:14.800 parent she's much more likely with like
00:39:16.480 with me if my daughter goes i want that
00:39:18.640 chocolate the answer to from me is are
00:39:20.560 you all right you know like i can't bear
00:39:22.800 to see the the resistance the emotional
00:39:25.599 explosion i concede much too early i tap
00:39:27.920 out very quickly with with my
00:39:30.000 two-year-old my wife is much more known
00:39:31.920 it's played a long game let's bring up a
00:39:33.520 child that's not governed by impulses
00:39:35.520 like you and i spoke in fact to that
00:39:36.880 gabor mate that expert on addiction he's
00:39:38.960 amazing
00:39:40.000 and he says because of your own anxiety
00:39:41.839 and pain from your own childhood with no
00:39:43.760 disrespect to my magnificent parents uh
00:39:46.000 like
00:39:46.880 you can't handle seeing your kid suffer
00:39:49.359 so you like straight away you bail and
00:39:51.520 do what she wants and stuff now like so
00:39:53.920 there's so much complexity in the
00:39:55.599 reality of our personal little domestic
00:39:58.880 relationship i'm certainly we're not
00:40:00.400 saying and everyone else should run
00:40:02.160 their household in that manner as well
00:40:03.839 and so help me god any man that changes
00:40:06.400 it up you know but the way it was
00:40:07.680 reported he's like that's what happens i
00:40:10.160 think in modern media is they change
00:40:11.839 what you say then you have to defend
00:40:13.359 what they said you said well that ain't
00:40:15.359 what i meant i'd like you know i'm not
00:40:17.119 saying that that because my wife is a
00:40:18.720 woman she should take more domestic i'm
00:40:20.640 just saying that in our household she
00:40:22.000 seems to have a set of attributes and
00:40:23.280 characteristics
00:40:24.400 that make her
00:40:25.680 take control of that aspect of parenting
00:40:27.839 and it's like the the desire to judge
00:40:30.160 condem and object is
00:40:32.640 the priority as opposed to you know no
00:40:34.800 one's looking to go honest who cares or
00:40:37.119 what you know well it's also that
00:40:38.560 they're doing it publicly so they're
00:40:40.160 doing it mostly i mean if you're you're
00:40:41.920 either reading comments or you're
00:40:43.599 reading articles and if you're reading
00:40:45.119 articles they're just looking for
00:40:46.240 something to be upset about they'll
00:40:47.440 watch you and they'll say okay is this a
00:40:49.440 viable target yes we got confirmation
00:40:52.000 what he said about changing diapers or
00:40:53.760 his wife being a better parent is a
00:40:55.920 viable target let's go after him and
00:40:57.839 then they just formulate some [ __ ]
00:41:00.160 argument about who you really are based
00:41:02.720 on what might have been a throwaway or a
00:41:04.560 concession to your wife or even just a
00:41:06.480 compliment to your wife
00:41:08.079 self-deprecating yourself yeah but it
00:41:10.240 doesn't people they're not looking at
00:41:11.920 things rationally they're just looking
00:41:13.440 at targets
00:41:14.880 particularly people that write articles
00:41:16.880 you know what's the best article it's
00:41:18.560 got to be negative like one of the
00:41:20.079 things that came out of all this
00:41:22.000 facebook algorithm stuff is you find out
00:41:24.720 that facebook realized somewhere early
00:41:27.440 on that the way to
00:41:29.359 encourage engagement is to get people
00:41:31.440 upset they they get way more engaged and
00:41:34.560 they go back and forth and and inter
00:41:37.280 interact with these posts way more if
00:41:39.760 they're upset than they do if they agree
00:41:42.160 with it if they agree with it they might
00:41:43.280 give it a like or a thumbs up and say
00:41:44.720 hey that's great and that's it that's
00:41:45.920 where it ends but if you know someone's
00:41:48.400 talking about you know we shouldn't
00:41:49.599 build the wall we should let everyone in
00:41:51.200 and you put that on some [ __ ] trump
00:41:52.800 guys page and they ah
00:41:54.640 it's crazy i mean you will get thousands
00:41:56.800 and thousands and thousands of
00:41:58.000 interactions
00:41:59.359 and so facebook realized that the way to
00:42:01.680 keep people and you know they could
00:42:03.440 claim that that it's an algorithm and
00:42:04.880 the algorithm just supports whatever the
00:42:07.119 people are really interested in but what
00:42:09.200 they're interested in is conflict
00:42:11.280 that demonstrates my earlier point which
00:42:13.119 i made up on the spot the ai is not a
00:42:16.000 neutral thing it is resourced from human
00:42:18.240 perspectives and because that is a type
00:42:20.079 of ai
00:42:21.440 not as complex as like what we're going
00:42:23.200 to experience and i can't even imagine
00:42:24.640 but what i'm saying is is it's still
00:42:26.800 di uh what i want to say resourced from
00:42:29.119 a human from a human perspective and yes
00:42:31.680 of course we are evolved to respond more
00:42:34.560 strongly to negativity than positivity
00:42:37.280 for loads of reasons and i think that's
00:42:38.640 where we can stitch back to what we were
00:42:41.119 saying about taking personal
00:42:42.640 responsibility for who you are like that
00:42:45.520 none of us have to sit on social media
00:42:47.760 going [ __ ] you [ __ ] you uh you know none
00:42:49.599 of us have to do that we can try and
00:42:51.200 resolve those i i respect that some
00:42:52.880 people don't have any other outlets they
00:42:54.480 don't have the privileges i have of
00:42:56.240 being out go a support groups where
00:42:58.160 people openly talk about this is the
00:42:59.680 ways that i felt inferior today this is
00:43:01.839 the ways that i'm trying to become a
00:43:03.440 better man and a better father and a
00:43:05.119 better co-worker you know like a lot of
00:43:06.880 people aren't afforded those
00:43:08.160 environments and probably the best shot
00:43:09.440 they got is having to go out with
00:43:10.880 someone online and those people you know
00:43:13.200 in a way deserve love and sympathy but
00:43:15.119 until we
00:43:16.400 on some level recognize that we can
00:43:19.040 alter our own behaviors we can all are
00:43:21.440 our own consciousness i don't i don't
00:43:23.920 see how there's going to be well at
00:43:26.000 least then we can create a terrain upon
00:43:28.400 which a better better systems can start
00:43:30.720 to flourish do you read comments no i
00:43:33.920 actually like
00:43:35.760 i'm too sensitive i can just about
00:43:37.599 manage to listen to people's replies to
00:43:40.000 my conversation like you know like sort
00:43:41.920 of like yeah i don't go on to like i
00:43:44.480 have a like i work with someone who does
00:43:46.640 my social media and like she gives me
00:43:49.280 stuff like here i'll respond to these
00:43:50.720 things put some output on that because i
00:43:52.880 don't uh i don't want to engage with
00:43:54.880 that i don't want to like walk up and
00:43:56.240 down any street knocking on the door
00:43:58.079 going do you like me do you like me do
00:44:00.160 you like me i don't want to deal with
00:44:01.680 people's responses and various
00:44:03.119 conditions well it's also much like the
00:44:04.960 articles with the way people get a
00:44:06.640 response out of you or the way to people
00:44:08.319 to get your reaction is to say something
00:44:10.319 really negative you know
00:44:12.000 you look at some sometimes when people
00:44:13.839 are not that savvy when it comes to
00:44:15.920 social media one thing's one of the
00:44:17.680 things that you'll notice is they'll
00:44:19.119 enter and i've been guilty of this in
00:44:20.720 the past before i sort of realized what
00:44:22.480 i was doing you would
00:44:24.160 only respond to negative things like
00:44:26.079 people are arguing with people meanwhile
00:44:27.680 people are saying nice things to you and
00:44:28.880 you ignore them yeah it's because you
00:44:30.720 don't you don't you at a certain level
00:44:33.040 you don't have the physical time it
00:44:35.280 doesn't exist to respond to everyone
00:44:37.040 it's not possible there's no if you get
00:44:39.680 13 000
00:44:41.680 comments on one of your posts how the
00:44:43.520 [ __ ] does anyone have time to respond to
00:44:46.560 13 000 people you can't and then you
00:44:49.200 have email and you have twitter and
00:44:50.800 facebook and instagram and it's just
00:44:52.560 there's no way it's there's not enough
00:44:54.400 time in this world so you would
00:44:56.079 potentially would have responded to
00:44:57.760 things that caused them more visceral if
00:45:00.000 i saw someone saying something was
00:45:01.119 untrue i'd be like [ __ ] you that's not
00:45:02.480 true but then i realized like what do
00:45:03.760 you why like what are you doing like
00:45:06.560 this is a new thing for people there's
00:45:08.400 never been a time where people have had
00:45:10.400 this instantaneous interaction with
00:45:12.640 people unfiltered
00:45:14.880 unmoderated
00:45:16.640 globally yeah and it's very strange to
00:45:19.680 be able to do that and to be able to go
00:45:21.680 back and forth and
00:45:23.359 just just to be able to give your
00:45:24.640 comments on things to be able to talk
00:45:26.160 about things it's very addictive to
00:45:27.839 people yeah that's right and that's why
00:45:30.000 i'm very cautious with it i have to sort
00:45:32.319 of set my life out like i'm essentially
00:45:34.960 a monk in a marriage that's
00:45:37.280 basically where i live get up meditate
00:45:39.839 do yoga do exercises do things that are
00:45:42.960 positive for you watch the way that
00:45:44.319 you're thinking i'm interested in where
00:45:46.880 again in
00:45:48.400 with your own
00:45:50.240 do you feel
00:45:51.520 uh
00:45:52.400 connected to the person you were as an
00:45:54.880 adolescent did you notice it in your own
00:45:56.960 parenting do you notice it in the type
00:45:58.880 of choices you make because the image i
00:46:00.400 have a view from the outside is like you
00:46:01.920 have literally built something for
00:46:03.200 yourself you operate within it and you
00:46:05.200 are quite protected and you are
00:46:07.359 independent and not forced to deal with
00:46:09.680 too many negative outside influences
00:46:11.760 but in unavoidable dynamics the
00:46:13.680 unnecessary dynamics like uh you know as
00:46:15.839 a father and dealing with colleagues and
00:46:17.839 stuff like that do you experience a lot
00:46:20.400 of tension anxiety what what has
00:46:23.440 happened to that guy do you feel that
00:46:24.960 you have transcended that because i do
00:46:26.720 in my own life i feel like yeah i'm not
00:46:28.160 the adolescent boy i was i've like you
00:46:29.920 know i've learned from that and i still
00:46:31.920 in a very sort of cod psychological way
00:46:34.079 you know when i'm doing uh hibiro that's
00:46:35.920 the bjj classes i'm doing over here with
00:46:38.480 uh professor ricardo will he's an
00:46:40.240 amazing guy like
00:46:41.839 when i'm when i'm doing those classes i
00:46:43.839 have a
00:46:44.800 sense of fathering my child's self of
00:46:47.920 like you know because i weren't doing
00:46:49.359 those kind of things when i was a kid
00:46:50.400 i'm like all right russell we're just in
00:46:51.760 a bjj class just relax don't need to
00:46:54.640 panic don't need to impress anybody
00:46:56.319 right just do that if you don't know
00:46:57.680 just ask
00:46:59.040 i've got a voice in myself because i
00:47:00.560 chat to tony robbins you know he's like
00:47:02.079 another obviously high achieving guy who
00:47:04.160 i admire and respect a great deal and
00:47:06.640 like you know when he talks he does like
00:47:07.839 these cold plunges and he says before i
00:47:09.359 get in that plunger you're getting in
00:47:10.800 that [ __ ] punch like he told us my
00:47:12.800 god i don't talk to myself like i'm like
00:47:14.480 right russell we're going to get in the
00:47:15.440 cold plunge we're going to relax like i
00:47:17.440 have to talk to myself gently what are
00:47:19.119 you doing with that aspect of yourself
00:47:21.200 do you still have a relationship with it
00:47:22.480 how is it like when you're doing all
00:47:23.599 these psychedelic cosmonautic
00:47:25.520 explorations of the psyche are you not
00:47:27.599 encountering aspects of yourself that
00:47:29.359 are un if undeveloped unaddressed
00:47:32.480 there's always going to be unaddressed
00:47:34.000 and undeveloped aspects of yourself but
00:47:35.760 i'm very very very different to who i
00:47:38.000 was when i was a young boy i mean um
00:47:41.359 i'm
00:47:42.160 i'm not 100 self-actualized i don't
00:47:44.160 think anybody is but i'm just a totally
00:47:46.800 different human being i remember it but
00:47:48.880 i remember it with humor like i remember
00:47:50.880 a laugh i'm like wow so silly i was so
00:47:53.520 weird back then
00:47:54.960 and uh you know with life experience and
00:47:58.560 developing confidence and understanding
00:48:01.359 of who you are and why you had those
00:48:03.440 feelings and why you were insecure and
00:48:05.599 why you had so much self-doubt
00:48:07.680 martial arts helped me with uh with that
00:48:09.760 tremendously because it was the first
00:48:11.119 thing that i ever did where i didn't
00:48:12.319 feel like a loser it's like the first
00:48:14.160 thing that i ever did where people like
00:48:15.760 respected me and they liked me for it
00:48:17.839 you know i'm like wow this is like
00:48:19.520 something it was a feeling that i was
00:48:21.440 completely unused to in the 14 previous
00:48:24.160 years of my life all of a sudden there
00:48:26.079 was this
00:48:27.200 this feeling that i was unusual i was
00:48:29.920 unique i was special wow you know i was
00:48:32.160 appreciated you were good at quick yeah
00:48:34.240 i was i had a natural inclination
00:48:37.119 towards it and i was obsessed with it so
00:48:39.680 i was obsessed with this i was training
00:48:41.359 every day all day long and then my
00:48:44.160 instructor recognized it really early on
00:48:46.079 so
00:48:46.880 he allowed me to train there for free
00:48:49.119 and just i would teach classes and
00:48:50.800 teaching classes helped me a lot as well
00:48:52.640 because when you're teaching
00:48:54.319 you're breaking down techniques and
00:48:55.839 you're you know you when you're showing
00:48:58.160 someone how to do it you're really
00:48:59.760 cementing those pathways in your own
00:49:02.079 mind yeah yeah that's right that must be
00:49:04.800 an important step on the road to mastery
00:49:07.040 i see that clip where eddie bravo gave
00:49:09.680 you your black belt and you were very
00:49:11.760 moved by that like so for me that like
00:49:14.079 moments like that it must connect you to
00:49:16.880 the beginning of the journey yeah that
00:49:19.280 does yeah for sure and it's still you
00:49:21.440 know the the journey of jiu jitsu is a
00:49:23.200 fascinating one because unless you're
00:49:25.119 someone who's you know a salubero or a
00:49:27.680 john jacques machado or just a true
00:49:29.839 master who has dedicated their entire
00:49:31.440 life to it the journey's so long it's so
00:49:34.640 long it's like if you're a guy who runs
00:49:36.880 you like to run i like to run a mile
00:49:38.559 three or four days a week no big deal
00:49:40.240 but then you know your next door
00:49:41.359 neighbor is an ultra marathon runner is
00:49:43.040 preparing for the the moab 240 where
00:49:45.520 he's going to run 240 miles
00:49:47.920 you're just you're never going to catch
00:49:49.359 up the same amount of times and you
00:49:50.960 should always defer to that person when
00:49:52.400 you have questions about running and
00:49:54.160 that's how it is with jiu jitsu because
00:49:56.160 you know yeah i'm a black belt but i'm
00:49:57.599 not a black belt like john jacques
00:49:58.880 machado as a black belt is that there's
00:50:01.040 levels to even to that so i always have
00:50:03.200 questions so the journey is never over
00:50:04.960 it's always long there's always a a
00:50:07.280 better way to get out of an arm bar or a
00:50:09.680 better way to set up a triangle or
00:50:11.440 whatever it is there's the one of the
00:50:13.280 beautiful things about jiu jitsu is that
00:50:14.800 it's so complex there's so many
00:50:17.520 variables there's so many situations and
00:50:19.839 interactions and exchanges and entries
00:50:22.160 and defenses and and and way to chain
00:50:24.880 moves together and the correct way to
00:50:27.200 set something up two three steps ahead
00:50:30.000 to know that if you grab the lapel this
00:50:32.400 way the guy's gonna try to shake it off
00:50:34.400 that way and that exposes this which
00:50:36.240 exposes that and then the next defense
00:50:38.079 will expose this and then you keep going
00:50:39.839 and going and going and going until you
00:50:41.359 get them it's so beautiful to watch that
00:50:43.520 because it's like as if there's a
00:50:44.800 pre-existing net or grid of interrelated
00:50:48.800 signs that will work together and like
00:50:51.440 as a white belt i've got three stripes
00:50:53.760 now i was like
00:50:55.119 thanks i was really hoping that by the
00:50:56.960 time i came back on here i would have a
00:50:58.880 blue belt and that could be closing in
00:51:00.559 on it i'm really working on a train i'm
00:51:02.400 training
00:51:03.359 three times a week private and i'm
00:51:04.880 attending two classes and what i've done
00:51:06.800 that's great thanks a lot and what's a
00:51:08.400 significant step for me is like now in
00:51:10.240 the classes when i'm sparring people i
00:51:12.240 don't try just in the handshake to
00:51:13.839 manipulate them into going easy
00:51:17.359 i said god you look so lovely today if
00:51:19.280 we go then
00:51:21.359 when you try to manipulate people yeah
00:51:23.119 like just a subtle gesture or something
00:51:24.960 like that right right right just try to
00:51:27.040 take it easy on me come on don't hurt me
00:51:30.319 come on you uh avoid big people
00:51:33.200 yeah sometimes i try and stay down that
00:51:34.880 white belt into the room but like now
00:51:36.640 the more i do it like the more they coax
00:51:38.720 me up there great big giant men like uh
00:51:41.359 like there's a guy that got like the
00:51:42.640 sort of one's up arrow like the hard end
00:51:44.640 purple belt above dave uh paul busby and
00:51:48.480 like there's people like their hands and
00:51:49.760 their feet look different to my hands
00:51:52.079 and feet as different than their hands
00:51:54.400 and feet are as different from mine as
00:51:56.160 mine are to my daughters and i feel like
00:51:58.400 how am i supposed to ever do anything
00:52:00.800 with these people like hard water like
00:52:03.119 drowning in hard water the way they move
00:52:06.160 and fold around me i'm like oh what i
00:52:08.000 would like to say what am i supposed to
00:52:09.680 do my breathing goes
00:52:12.400 but the thing is with other white belts
00:52:15.040 is that uh what i feel is like there is
00:52:18.079 my ego comes back in because i feel like
00:52:20.319 no i should be getting something the
00:52:21.200 first time i got choked out by another
00:52:22.880 white belt
00:52:24.559 i felt like i went into a room i'd not
00:52:26.800 been in since i was 16 getting my head
00:52:28.640 kicked in in bus stops you know and
00:52:30.160 stuff like this i felt like i was quiet
00:52:32.240 for 24 hours just sitting and reflecting
00:52:35.280 on oh [ __ ] and i had to speak to other
00:52:36.720 people
00:52:38.559 this happens you're going to experience
00:52:40.240 right right so it doesn't mean i'm a bad
00:52:42.400 person
00:52:43.920 that i've failed no no you're gonna have
00:52:46.480 to get used to that if you're gonna get
00:52:48.480 used to humiliation you get used to
00:52:50.319 defeat but it's it's that humbling is
00:52:52.319 very good for you you know i mean i i
00:52:54.559 don't know how many times i've been
00:52:55.599 tapped out in my life but it's probably
00:52:57.359 more than a thousand probably probably
00:52:59.520 thousands
00:53:00.960 you know
00:53:02.240 yeah and there uh do you sit there while
00:53:04.400 i tell you about jiu jitsu and the other
00:53:06.319 and the other thing that's been good
00:53:07.599 about it is like when it is the other
00:53:09.920 way like i remember like a guy that was
00:53:11.520 a big guy on top of me and like i was he
00:53:14.000 oh he was in mount right and like he
00:53:17.520 wasn't actually applying a submission
00:53:19.680 but there's just the sheer discomfort of
00:53:21.599 having someone there their body their
00:53:23.839 sweat their hair their abdomen their
00:53:26.400 reproductive organs their digestive
00:53:28.400 system
00:53:29.280 feces in their bowel on top of me i just
00:53:32.559 nearly tapped out that but then he went
00:53:34.319 to move to get an umbrella hang on a
00:53:36.800 second there's a moment and i managed to
00:53:39.200 escape from that and like the amount of
00:53:41.359 energy that that releases like [ __ ] you
00:53:44.319 justice
00:53:46.800 now i win
00:53:49.359 justice
00:53:50.800 that's hilarious yeah yeah this is a
00:53:52.960 very satisfying feeling it's also very
00:53:54.960 satisfying to
00:53:56.800 to defend against something that someone
00:53:58.480 used to catch you with like say if
00:53:59.839 someone's really good at taking your
00:54:01.040 back yeah choked you a couple times and
00:54:02.960 then one time they take you back but you
00:54:04.559 defend and you get out you're like i got
00:54:06.319 out yes there's an escape i can make
00:54:08.640 this i'm getting better i love being in
00:54:11.440 the cave that mental space because what
00:54:14.240 my technique was oh i'm not good at that
00:54:16.640 never bother trying i'm not good at that
00:54:18.720 kind of stuff never bother trying so for
00:54:20.480 me at this stage in my life to go and do
00:54:22.400 something that i'm not good at that's
00:54:24.240 with other men that's competitive they
00:54:26.240 involve so much vulnerability and
00:54:28.720 failure and learning i'm thinking well
00:54:30.720 you've you're growing you've got to be
00:54:32.319 growing so you're doing stuff that you
00:54:33.839 never would have done before even
00:54:35.200 turning up at a new place like i'm doing
00:54:37.200 here in la and making those new
00:54:38.800 relationships and doing that you know
00:54:41.040 it's amazing for me another thing i'm
00:54:42.559 into is the integrity of it right
00:54:44.400 because chris clear a black belt under
00:54:47.280 roger gracie right in uk my teacher like
00:54:50.160 if he gave me a blue belt that would
00:54:52.240 look good man it would be videoed it
00:54:54.400 would i would tweet it it would be
00:54:55.760 everywhere oh russell brown got blue
00:54:57.359 belt this [ __ ] must work but no he
00:54:59.359 doesn't do it out of integrity and
00:55:01.040 respect for that you know it means more
00:55:03.119 to him evidently than a sim the act of
00:55:06.000 kindness
00:55:07.680 you know so like what is nice to belong
00:55:09.440 to something that has protected and
00:55:11.520 valuable systems he did say to me you
00:55:13.040 keep going by the end of the year blue
00:55:14.800 belt i think but like uh you know it's
00:55:16.960 not dished out like it's nice to know
00:55:19.040 that there's some kind of order an area
00:55:20.559 where celebrity manipulation charm human
00:55:22.800 none of those things all redundant all
00:55:24.400 redundant no in jiu jitsu it's very
00:55:26.319 protected anyone that gives out a bad
00:55:28.640 belt it's very bad for their integrity
00:55:30.880 it's the the the school
00:55:33.440 would lose face so badly in the
00:55:35.520 community
00:55:36.640 and you meet someone who's a hicks and
00:55:39.520 gracie brown belt that [ __ ] is a
00:55:42.400 hicks and crazy brown belt he's as legit
00:55:45.040 as they get they don't get any more
00:55:47.119 legit like if you got to that point of
00:55:49.599 hicks and gracie gives you a brown belt
00:55:51.440 it's just it's irrefutable and that's
00:55:54.160 how it should be and it's a beautiful
00:55:55.839 thing about the art form is that it has
00:55:58.079 this self-correcting sort of aspect to
00:56:00.240 it that
00:56:01.680 when you roll when you spar with each
00:56:03.520 other it your ability or lack of is
00:56:06.559 exposed and there's no other way around
00:56:08.480 it yeah that's good to not avoid that
00:56:11.359 yes
00:56:13.440 but you'll be better you know you're
00:56:15.280 you're a fit guy you're a healthy guy if
00:56:17.359 you just keep going get off that [ __ ]
00:56:19.280 vegan diet and keep going
00:56:21.280 i watched the documentary um called what
00:56:24.160 the health have you seen it's like yeah
00:56:25.920 it's filled with a lot of propaganda
00:56:27.920 propaganda damn those guys are getting
00:56:30.000 like the nazis i remember them it's they
00:56:32.240 used a lot of
00:56:33.599 discredited studies and
00:56:36.000 there's a lot of epidemiology studies
00:56:38.160 that will connect things
00:56:40.240 what does that mean like an epidemic
00:56:42.000 no we could pull up what the actual
00:56:44.400 it's about time jamie pulled something
00:56:46.079 up episode
00:56:47.280 but the way i would describe it is they
00:56:49.119 would do these studies and essentially
00:56:51.040 it would be they would they would ask
00:56:53.280 you what you eat on a daily basis how
00:56:56.240 often to eat meat how and it's basically
00:56:58.079 a survey
00:56:59.280 and in in that survey they would say
00:57:01.599 well there's a direct correlation
00:57:02.880 between people that eat meat and
00:57:04.799 diabetes so let's pull up the definition
00:57:07.200 oh i see but the problem is
00:57:09.920 what is causing here a branch of
00:57:12.160 medicine which deals with incidence
00:57:13.920 distribution and possible control of
00:57:16.319 diseases and other factors relating to
00:57:18.400 health
00:57:19.599 um so when they're when they're dealing
00:57:22.640 with
00:57:23.440 incidents right they're dealing with how
00:57:25.520 often do you eat red meat how often do
00:57:27.440 you eat this how often you eat that and
00:57:28.720 then they find
00:57:29.920 oh well there's more instances of
00:57:32.160 diabetes in people that eat meat okay
00:57:34.480 but is it people that eat meat and
00:57:36.400 vegetables or is it people that eat meat
00:57:38.480 and vegetables and diet coke and sugary
00:57:41.520 sodas and ice cream and french fries and
00:57:44.240 how are they eating their meat are they
00:57:45.680 eating cheeseburgers for some [ __ ]
00:57:47.839 fast food place are they eating
00:57:49.040 grass-fed steak are they eating
00:57:50.960 grass-fed steak and vegetables
00:57:53.359 and there's very little evidence that
00:57:55.920 shows there's anything wrong with eating
00:57:57.440 meat if you follow a normal healthy what
00:57:59.920 they would call a primal diet
00:58:03.040 cut out all the grains cut on all the
00:58:04.799 sugar cut out all the [ __ ] eat
00:58:06.720 vegetables and meat and there's almost
00:58:10.079 nothing i mean unless you have some very
00:58:12.720 unusual rare condition
00:58:14.960 where you're either allergic to meat or
00:58:16.880 you have some
00:58:18.079 very strange
00:58:19.839 digestive system where you find you have
00:58:21.680 allergies to it or you have real
00:58:23.440 problems digesting it or you have real
00:58:25.119 problems with high cholesterol foods
00:58:27.119 which is very rare as well
00:58:28.880 most of what you're getting is vegan
00:58:30.880 propaganda people that want other people
00:58:32.960 to be convinced that the way that
00:58:34.799 they're living is the correct way and
00:58:36.799 that eating meat is is physically bad
00:58:39.599 for you and it's causing all these harms
00:58:41.040 what's causing all the harm for people
00:58:43.040 physically is the modern american diet
00:58:44.960 and that's been pretty established yes
00:58:46.960 that's right and there are clear ethical
00:58:48.799 reasons to be vegan in that it takes you
00:58:50.640 out of the exploitation of animals but
00:58:52.480 that documentary what the health that i
00:58:53.839 watched was like you know i've been
00:58:54.880 vegetarian for years and this like and
00:58:56.240 i've gone back and forth to veganism
00:58:57.520 because i feel god jesus christ man
00:58:58.960 there's enough things in my life i'm not
00:59:00.160 doing without not being i have an egg
00:59:02.400 without feeling good you could have
00:59:03.599 passed your raised eggs if you get them
00:59:05.520 from a good farm the chickens are just
00:59:07.599 hanging out i've got chickens in my
00:59:08.960 garden yeah i'm not confident in these
00:59:10.720 animals and the way that well one by one
00:59:12.880 slowly my dog's eliminating the gift of
00:59:15.520 life
00:59:18.559 i lost nine of them to coyotes just last
00:59:20.640 month maybe two months ago that's a
00:59:22.480 pretty heavy
00:59:23.680 heavy toll yeah well we had a fire out
00:59:26.079 here and the chicken coop burnt down we
00:59:27.839 got a smaller chicken coop and the
00:59:29.119 coyotes figured out how to get into it
00:59:30.559 when we're at home and we came home to
00:59:32.240 just feathers everywhere it was
00:59:33.680 disgusting oh that's brutal they're
00:59:35.680 they're brutal little monsters those
00:59:37.119 coyotes yeah yeah
00:59:39.040 you know ungovernable they're the reason
00:59:40.559 why we don't have rats everywhere too
00:59:42.160 all right so yeah it's the circle of
00:59:43.920 life the lion king was right so like hey
00:59:46.720 though um
00:59:48.160 the thing that about that vegan
00:59:50.240 documentary mate is that it it tuned in
00:59:53.440 to my pre-existing belief when it said
00:59:55.839 stuff like oh the diabetes association
00:59:58.319 they are funded by these meat and dairy
01:00:00.559 organizations and these pharmaceutical
01:00:02.160 companies the cancer
01:00:03.920 organization similarly accepts donations
01:00:06.160 from these organizations and it made me
01:00:08.480 recognize like my pre-existing idea that
01:00:10.640 i come to it with is you know like that
01:00:12.640 whole pyramid of these are the things
01:00:14.160 you should eat bread milk you know it
01:00:16.559 just were the things that it was easy
01:00:18.160 and cheap to produce and that were
01:00:19.839 profitable
01:00:21.040 but they used to think that they really
01:00:22.480 did used to think that bread would and
01:00:23.839 grains are the most important thing do
01:00:25.200 you think they felt that i think they
01:00:26.960 did i think they thought it was it was
01:00:28.799 filling and it provided energy and i
01:00:30.799 don't think they understood well there
01:00:32.559 was no talk of gluten intolerance when
01:00:34.400 we were young that didn't exist and
01:00:35.839 there was no understanding of excess
01:00:38.160 carbs and how excess carbs leads to
01:00:41.119 excess body weight and it makes it makes
01:00:43.520 you store fat and people didn't think
01:00:45.760 about it that way they didn't understand
01:00:47.520 there was the thing about nutrition is
01:00:49.520 that nutrition science is a it's a body
01:00:52.000 of knowledge that's constantly added to
01:00:53.920 yeah and in fact perhaps most things are
01:00:56.160 who knows what misapprehensions and
01:00:58.880 ignorance we toil under that will be
01:01:01.280 revealed to us do you do any uh i feel
01:01:03.920 like i've heard you talk about
01:01:05.839 hormone stuff yeah yeah i do hormonal
01:01:08.799 replacement what type of things
01:01:10.319 testosterone and human growth hormone do
01:01:12.400 you have to give yourself a jab in the
01:01:13.760 ass yeah you get in the thigh thigh you
01:01:16.000 won't do the art out of simple pride no
01:01:18.400 it doesn't matter
01:01:19.920 that's for mrs rogan
01:01:22.559 i don't touch that
01:01:24.559 your thigh's right there it's easy to
01:01:26.240 grab when you're reaching back to
01:01:27.920 putting your ass it's just like an
01:01:29.200 awkward

01:01:34.720 you're taking like so you're taking
01:01:36.079 growth hormone
01:01:37.599 you've not noticed any negative side
01:01:39.520 effects or insulin well you have to get
01:01:41.119 your blood monitored you know when you
01:01:43.280 when you're doing something like that
01:01:44.720 this this is also if you're a person
01:01:46.559 that has addictive problems addiction
01:01:48.640 problems which i don't necessarily have
01:01:50.240 them as much with substances what do you
01:01:51.680 have them
01:01:52.720 um
01:01:53.680 well you saw with video games when you
01:01:55.760 got here the video game problem that i
01:01:57.359 have yeah you're frantic you emerged out
01:01:58.960 of that dark room you and your parents
01:02:00.559 were sweaty and pie-eyed and baffled by
01:02:03.200 the very fun too um martial arts i've
01:02:06.079 been addicted to martial arts i've been
01:02:07.839 addicted to playing pool i get addicted
01:02:10.000 to getting good at things i get very
01:02:12.480 addicted to things if there's something
01:02:13.839 that i get obsessed with like jiu jitsu
01:02:15.599 or whatever it is i get obsessed and
01:02:17.359 that's all i think about all day long i
01:02:19.440 just had i just you know it's not
01:02:21.440 healthy
01:02:22.400 but with um hormones you want to make
01:02:25.200 sure that you don't overdose yourself
01:02:27.280 you want to make sure that you stay
01:02:28.559 within a very
01:02:30.000 narrow range where you're you know your
01:02:33.280 you have
01:02:34.559 what are the healthy levels of uh a
01:02:37.680 person that's in their you know late 20s
01:02:40.720 that's that's really what you want you
01:02:42.319 don't want to have hyper human levels
01:02:44.319 which some people do do
01:02:46.559 hyper human you're going to create an
01:02:48.319 odd ecosystem well you're [ __ ] up
01:02:50.000 your body man you're just jolting
01:02:51.599 yourself with all this extra [ __ ] what
01:02:53.760 are you about to take
01:02:55.359 this sweet lady thyroid
01:02:58.079 is that part of your system yeah i have
01:03:00.799 i take armor thyroid it's actually made
01:03:02.880 from pigs thyroids do you mean pigs
01:03:05.280 firoids now yeah like hold on what's
01:03:08.160 happened to the pig
01:03:10.000 they're long gone they're not sort of
01:03:11.280 struggling with a lack of thyroid
01:03:13.599 teetering about all emasculated well
01:03:16.319 this is like so yeah i'm interested in
01:03:18.160 this hormone stuff i'm interested in
01:03:19.920 that but you know me i've got to be very
01:03:21.280 very like
01:03:22.799 cautious about moodle or in
01:03:25.839 stuff yeah but
01:03:27.440 if you have the exercise regiment that
01:03:29.520 you're talking about i don't think
01:03:30.480 you're going to have anything to get
01:03:31.200 that blue belt i'm going to do what it
01:03:32.640 takes man
01:03:35.599 yeah bring me the pig i'll suck that
01:03:37.680 thought of thyroid out of it directly
01:03:39.440 you should eat eggs though man you
01:03:40.880 really should you should eat you should
01:03:42.480 eat some animal protein without i mean
01:03:44.400 if you oppose
01:03:46.240 the moral aspect of killing an animal
01:03:48.400 which i totally understand and
01:03:49.440 appreciate and that's what led me to
01:03:51.280 become a hunter in the first place is
01:03:52.640 that i was really uncomfortable watching
01:03:54.240 these animal rights videos of factory
01:03:56.559 farming i thought it was disgusting i
01:03:57.760 was like i don't want to participate in
01:03:59.039 this yeah it's reprehensible hunting is
01:04:00.880 a different thing man to me hunting is
01:04:02.880 this intense it's very spiritual in a
01:04:05.520 way i mean people don't get it because
01:04:07.039 they see you celebrating when it's over
01:04:08.559 because
01:04:09.760 it's very very very difficult to close
01:04:12.160 in on a wild animal what are you hunting
01:04:14.799 mostly elk well elk's my favorite for
01:04:16.960 two reasons one it's very delicious
01:04:18.960 super nutritious also if i shoot one elk
01:04:21.359 i could eat it for like eight months
01:04:24.720 salty yeah freezing them freezing so
01:04:27.119 you're out stalking an elk on the plains
01:04:30.480 where are you like near where you live
01:04:31.760 you just go out
01:04:33.200 you travel on bikes or something how do
01:04:34.960 you follow you can yeah you do travel on
01:04:37.200 bikes if you're a whitetail hunt a lot
01:04:39.200 of times you'll go into the woods with
01:04:40.720 bikes because they don't leave a scent
01:04:42.240 the way your feet do
01:04:43.760 you know and um animals don't associate
01:04:45.920 the sound of a bike the way they
01:04:46.960 associate it with like the sound of
01:04:48.640 stepping bipedal hominids stepping
01:04:51.440 towards they've evolved oh
01:04:53.760 yeah they see you on a bike they don't
01:04:54.880 even freak out as much delightful never
01:04:56.799 seen that but what's that my brain what
01:04:58.880 are these things yeah yeah yeah
01:05:00.880 elk are they like heard animals so you
01:05:02.559 just see like a herd yeah yeah you see a
01:05:04.720 herd of them and you try to figure out
01:05:06.400 which way the wind's blowing and you try
01:05:08.000 to get close to them is this a video of
01:05:09.760 us yeah this is a video that's from uh
01:05:11.440 what a beautiful place i mean i can see
01:05:13.119 the harmony of nature yeah so that's an
01:05:15.200 elk
01:05:16.319 now the thing is with me i see that elk
01:05:18.400 there and i sort of feel
01:05:20.720 like a sort of i've watched too much
01:05:22.400 disney yeah um you know like i see that
01:05:25.039 elk and i feel like i'm bambi literally
01:05:27.520 you know
01:05:28.400 like i don't have it like is that early
01:05:30.319 in the morning you look yeah tired not
01:05:32.480 tired it might be late afternoon
01:05:33.839 actually can you take those late
01:05:35.359 afternoon yeah like say like i i from
01:05:38.880 that position i couldn't like i would
01:05:41.359 love the game of being able to own
01:05:44.079 because actually i've had to go down gun
01:05:45.280 ranges it turns out i'm pretty good shot
01:05:46.880 and it's nice to see that thing come
01:05:48.480 back with like holes around its abdomen
01:05:51.039 and its head i think satisfied yeah
01:05:53.359 you've been dealt with paper man but but
01:05:55.760 like the elk i couldn't i've got too
01:05:57.760 much empathy in me that i like i
01:06:00.559 couldn't deal with the feeling of
01:06:02.960 after it was shot i like it like almost
01:06:05.680 thinking about it the sentimentality of
01:06:07.599 it i've sentimentalized it now you know
01:06:09.280 at least i don't eat meat and stuff like
01:06:10.960 that so it's not like i have all those
01:06:12.079 feelings but can handle it in a packaged
01:06:14.480 portioned off way yeah it's just i feel
01:06:16.880 too much like oh that creature so what
01:06:19.520 in your head when you're doing it when
01:06:21.520 you're pulling the trigger you're not
01:06:22.799 having what's going on in your mind
01:06:25.039 well
01:06:25.839 you you only are hunting these mature
01:06:28.640 animals that have already passed on
01:06:30.559 their genes you also are recognizing
01:06:33.520 that if you're not killing these things
01:06:36.079 they're not it's not like they're going
01:06:37.039 to live forever
01:06:38.480 they are they live a short life a short
01:06:41.200 life with a very violent death it's
01:06:43.119 either wolves or mountain lions or bears
01:06:45.839 or something's going to take them out
01:06:47.359 yeah what you're doing is essentially
01:06:49.359 dipping your toe into the natural world
01:06:52.000 and i've heard the argument that well
01:06:53.520 this is ridiculous because everyone
01:06:55.039 can't do that you know if everyone went
01:06:57.280 out and hunted all the animals there
01:06:59.119 would be no animals left which is true
01:07:01.440 but um i'm not everyone and yeah so i
01:07:04.079 don't you know i can't really use that
01:07:05.680 if everyone did the argument it's a good
01:07:07.599 argument because you you if you're
01:07:09.200 encouraging people to hunt it is kind of
01:07:11.440 a good argument because it's not
01:07:12.880 realistic it's not sustainable
01:07:15.200 but the other thing to recognize is that
01:07:17.119 the reason why most of this wildlife
01:07:19.680 exists in the first place a lot of it
01:07:20.960 was wiped out in the early
01:07:23.039 20th century
01:07:24.640 from what they call market hunting in
01:07:27.200 the late late 19th century early 20th
01:07:29.520 century um they you know they didn't
01:07:31.680 have refrigeration and uh it was hard to
01:07:34.000 get food and we didn't have the same
01:07:35.599 sort of large-scale agriculture that we
01:07:37.599 have today
01:07:38.799 and so when someone would want meat they
01:07:41.440 would uh somebody would either have to
01:07:43.280 hunt it for you and you would go to the
01:07:44.799 market and and get that hunted food or
01:07:48.079 you would go out and do it yourself and
01:07:50.559 they basically wiped out most of the
01:07:52.880 wildlife in north america to the point
01:07:54.880 of extinction whitetail deer elk they've
01:07:57.359 been extirpated from the majority of
01:07:59.839 their range in north america and only
01:08:01.599 been replaced in a few other places but
01:08:04.400 the places where they've been replaced
01:08:06.160 it's all through money that was
01:08:07.680 generated through hunting tags all
01:08:09.599 through billions and billions of dollars
01:08:11.760 there's a thing called the robertson
01:08:13.839 pikmin i think that's what it's called
01:08:15.440 act where uh 10
01:08:17.520 if you buy hunting gear and equipment 10
01:08:20.640 of that money goes to habitat
01:08:22.238 restoration
01:08:24.799 making sure that uh rangers and forest
01:08:28.158 people get funded so there's uh the fish
01:08:30.960 and game department gets funded and all
01:08:33.679 and also population conservation making
01:08:36.479 sure that the populations are healthy
01:08:38.560 repopulating certain areas with elk and
01:08:41.279 deer
01:08:42.319 and this has all been done through the
01:08:44.399 money that's generated through hunting
01:08:46.238 yeah i can see that there's a looking at
01:08:48.640 my own feelings towards it i can see
01:08:50.880 that there's a potentially i'm bringing
01:08:52.880 a sentimentality
01:08:54.719 to the idea of animals that's like
01:08:56.880 anthropomorphic yeah like i'm like oh
01:08:58.960 you can't kill that it what about it's
01:09:00.719 babies you know like thinking about
01:09:02.880 things like that um but what i you know
01:09:05.839 i live in a rural area in britain where
01:09:08.880 like hunting is normal and i wouldn't
01:09:11.439 and agriculture is normal and i wouldn't
01:09:14.000 get very far if i was like you can't
01:09:16.238 shoot those pheasants look at their
01:09:17.279 feathers they're beautiful you know i
01:09:18.479 mean like it wouldn't it's not a helpful
01:09:20.399 attitude so whilst i
01:09:22.158 like record like in myself i couldn't do
01:09:24.238 that because like i don't it messes me
01:09:26.560 up on a sort of a feels like a very sort
01:09:28.799 of deep visceral level you know like but
01:09:31.359 i feel like this is precisely the kind
01:09:33.679 of territory where we have to look at
01:09:35.759 acknowledging and tolerate indifference
01:09:38.158 between us this is where i feel like the
01:09:40.319 sort of these ossified polarized
01:09:42.560 positions between right and left are
01:09:44.560 starting to take root because if someone
01:09:46.640 like me who don't eat meat don't eat
01:09:49.198 animal products and wouldn't hunt for
01:09:50.799 ethical reasons starts trying to impose
01:09:53.600 on other people now you shouldn't hunt
01:09:55.280 because of this that have you not
01:09:56.320 watched bambi you know like that's going
01:09:58.000 to mean that people aren't able to
01:09:59.600 explore who they are
01:10:01.520 so and so my per i've let go of judging
01:10:05.040 people around things that i don't agree
01:10:08.000 with because i reckon i don't know
01:10:10.560 everything you know i mean i'm this this
01:10:12.320 is like this is about my morality is
01:10:14.560 about how i behave and if people
01:10:16.560 said to me i'm thinking about going
01:10:18.480 hunting i'd go well these are my
01:10:20.000 feelings about it however though i just
01:10:21.520 heard that hunting does contribute
01:10:23.679 apparently to the survival of some
01:10:25.040 species and there is an argument that
01:10:26.400 it's quite natural and indigenous and
01:10:27.840 it's probably a way of getting in
01:10:29.120 contact with who we are originally as
01:10:32.000 hunting people it's an important part of
01:10:33.679 our anthropological history and possibly
01:10:36.000 a lot of the condemnation of hunting is
01:10:38.080 part of the rejection of who we used to
01:10:40.400 be as we become overly civilized and
01:10:42.239 more and more detached from what it is
01:10:44.000 to be human whether that's sacred or
01:10:46.000 pragmatic we don't know what human
01:10:48.159 beings are anymore we reject our own
01:10:49.600 sexuality we reject our own bodies we
01:10:51.840 reject you know we're trying to turn
01:10:53.199 ourselves into these sort of cyborgs
01:10:55.600 these emotionless sexless
01:10:58.800 meaningless creatures where is our
01:11:01.120 passion where is our connection with the
01:11:02.719 sacred they would go hold on i only
01:11:04.719 asked you about hunting when are you
01:11:06.320 going to stop talking never you gave me
01:11:08.640 an in i will pummel you with my belief
01:11:11.040 system on all things
01:11:12.400 like you know like so i don't feel like
01:11:14.560 that ain't where i get a judging people
01:11:16.480 um but like i'm interested as well
01:11:19.520 with this i keep bringing up the subject
01:11:21.199 of dmt uh like
01:11:23.760 what
01:11:25.520 i guess what i want to know about is
01:11:27.920 like because i i'm you know obviously a
01:11:29.440 person in recovery i don't drink i don't
01:11:30.800 take drugs haven't done for a long time
01:11:33.120 and i recognize for certain people that
01:11:34.800 they they can't do it safely
01:11:37.440 psychedelics and hallucinogens it seem
01:11:39.520 to me exist in a realm outside of that
01:11:41.600 because they're not about they're not
01:11:42.640 pleasure seeking there's like seem to me
01:11:44.960 like it's a spiritual portal however i'm
01:11:47.280 a crafty bastard when it comes to this
01:11:49.840 stuff and i'm always looking for an inn
01:11:52.000 you know when i see your
01:11:53.520 cannabis treasure trove over there i
01:11:56.080 mean that is some yeah as you said like
01:11:57.920 raiders of the lost ark stuff and i'm
01:11:59.760 holding in my hand now the cbd rich
01:12:02.320 cannabis soft gels clasping it you know
01:12:05.120 so like i'm
01:12:06.159 worried that that is a gateway that cbd
01:12:08.880 which is not necessarily psychoactive
01:12:10.719 because there's no psychological it's
01:12:12.080 not but it does help you with anxiety it
01:12:14.000 helps a lot of people because it
01:12:15.120 alleviates a lot of uh inflammation
01:12:17.280 which tends to have a corresponding
01:12:19.679 impact on on your anxiety hold on so
01:12:22.400 this says here 11 milligrams of thc does
01:12:24.960 that mean i mean it says thc it does say
01:12:28.080 that the bottom probably one is this a
01:12:30.000 one to one it might be or it's like 18
01:12:32.080 to one or eleven it says there's an
01:12:33.600 eleven and a one there's a couple
01:12:34.800 different ones in that box oh i gave you
01:12:36.400 almost gave you the wrong one joe what's
01:12:38.080 next
01:12:39.600 a bag of smack don't take that
01:12:42.000 this one guys i think this one this
01:12:43.520 one's way more powerful that's one to
01:12:44.960 one yeah you seem do seem very relaxed
01:12:46.960 and free from anxiety
01:12:48.560 i will say that um but like so like
01:12:51.120 what i suppose i'm interested in because
01:12:52.800 look listen i'm meditating the whole
01:12:54.640 like i meditate a lot i'm doing all
01:12:56.320 these things i'm experiencing
01:12:58.000 transcendent states i'm experiencing
01:12:59.679 what it's like to not feel attached to
01:13:01.520 my identity as russell who are you
01:13:03.280 before you are russell who are you
01:13:04.719 before you identify
01:13:06.320 yourself as a man in england who are you
01:13:08.960 who is the person who is the
01:13:10.159 consciousness who is the awareness now
01:13:11.679 when i listen to say terence mckenna
01:13:13.600 talking about his experiences in
01:13:15.600 psychedelia at such length and with such
01:13:17.360 lucidity and with so many philosophical
01:13:20.159 connotations and the way that he uses
01:13:22.400 the information he's getting from
01:13:23.840 hallucigenics um experiences to
01:13:26.159 speculate on how we should organize
01:13:27.840 society
01:13:29.440 what the implications are for freedom
01:13:31.199 his refusal to accept that there are
01:13:33.520 certain kind of experiences that should
01:13:35.120 be prohibited that it's ridiculous that
01:13:36.960 adults should be prevented from having
01:13:38.480 that i i'm fascinated but i'm also i
01:13:41.520 suppose part of my bias is i love
01:13:43.600 anything that gets me out of my head i
01:13:45.440 feel a tremendous sense of relief
01:13:47.280 whether it's through meditation or even
01:13:48.880 sport
01:13:50.000 or sex being relieved of the burden of
01:13:52.400 the constantly thinking mind but when i
01:13:54.800 hear like those um vivid ex descriptions
01:13:59.040 of dmt realm or wescor i think something
01:14:02.320 in me hungers for that hungers for it do
01:14:05.040 you worry that you're trying to get
01:14:06.320 intoxicated you worry that you're but
01:14:08.159 you're trying to find a loophole yeah
01:14:09.920 because i am doing that i'm looking for
01:14:12.400 a loophole it's like i'm going around
01:14:14.159 like a sort of a trash lawyer looking
01:14:16.640 for some way to get into there hold on a
01:14:19.199 second what about this lawyer that's a
01:14:21.199 great way of putting it yeah i mean uh i
01:14:23.920 know people that have problems with
01:14:25.679 addiction that have done psychedelics
01:14:27.360 and didn't have a problem
01:14:29.040 but i'm sure some people have had
01:14:31.840 problems and i don't know about them
01:14:34.080 dmt is interesting in that first of all
01:14:35.920 it's very quick the experience is only
01:14:37.840 about 15 minutes 20 minutes max and it's
01:14:40.640 also it's not necessary
01:14:43.120 it's not intoxicant in the way that you
01:14:45.280 would think about traditionally you are
01:14:46.719 still you in in the face of this
01:14:48.960 experience and i think
01:14:52.080 i think it's some sort of a chemical
01:14:53.440 gateway that's what i think i think
01:14:55.199 there's a gateway in your mind that can
01:14:57.840 lead to
01:14:58.880 some other dimension that's probably
01:15:00.480 there all the time if there is a uh
01:15:03.760 omnipresent continually existing realm
01:15:07.040 that human beings aren't accessing
01:15:08.800 because of the particular biochemical
01:15:10.719 formulation of consciousness as it is in
01:15:12.880 this point in our evolution yeah and
01:15:14.800 that we can get there and it seems as
01:15:16.800 like you know i've heard terence mckenna
01:15:17.920 say it's more real you know it's more
01:15:20.480 real there's stuff in there you know and
01:15:23.120 excuse me and when he talks about them
01:15:24.560 beings you know like that he describes
01:15:26.320 himself dribbling basketballs creating
01:15:29.199 like faberge egg like you know
01:15:31.679 devices through vibration and it tells
01:15:33.760 you to do it i never saw him i wouldn't
01:15:35.280 that i wanted he's called the machine
01:15:36.960 elves he's called them all sorts of
01:15:38.320 different things the way i've described
01:15:40.000 them is they're the geometric patterns
01:15:42.560 made out of love and understanding
01:15:45.120 that's how they seem like so you read
01:15:46.880 you can look at a geometrical pattern
01:15:48.640 and read meaning into it it had an
01:15:50.560 emotional quality they're made out of
01:15:52.400 something and they move they change like
01:15:55.280 they don't stay what they are they're
01:15:56.880 constantly evolving in front of you into
01:15:59.120 something more and more beautiful it's
01:16:00.960 very weird what did it make you feel
01:16:04.560 like i knew nothing
01:16:06.719 that was the most profound aspect like
01:16:08.640 all of this stuff that you concentrate
01:16:10.239 on every day is nonsense and there is
01:16:12.719 some other thing that's connected that's
01:16:15.520 probably influencing this world yeah and
01:16:17.920 it's probably what what people see when
01:16:19.760 they have near-death experiences the
01:16:21.360 depictions of the afterlife i mean
01:16:23.120 that's probably what it all is and
01:16:24.800 religious experiences and when prophets
01:16:27.040 are talking about oh my god i went into
01:16:28.640 this realm there's these beings they've
01:16:30.400 told me we're all one we have to love
01:16:32.560 each other scholars in jerusalem are
01:16:34.640 connecting moses's experience with the
01:16:37.280 burning bush to the acacia tree the
01:16:39.199 acacia tree which is rich in dmt the
01:16:41.679 burning bush is what god was to moses
01:16:44.640 and that through this burning bush he
01:16:46.239 came out with these ten commandments of
01:16:48.080 how people should live their lives i
01:16:50.080 mean that easily could have been
01:16:52.239 just
01:16:53.040 a very convoluted
01:16:55.760 sort of translation of a dmt trip
01:16:58.080 certainly and also when you think of
01:17:00.800 certainly there are archetypal images
01:17:02.560 that seem to be repeated throughout
01:17:04.080 ancient cultures and archaic stories
01:17:06.640 that seem to refer to the potential for
01:17:09.280 plant experiences to affect
01:17:11.679 consciousness even the garden of eden do
01:17:14.719 not eat of the fruit of the tree of
01:17:16.800 knowledge yeah otherwise you will become
01:17:18.640 as gods
01:17:19.920 you know like i sense that now if
01:17:22.640 if there is some realm that we can reach
01:17:25.199 through that experience that scene that
01:17:26.960 puts into perspective everything that
01:17:29.280 else we experience on the material realm
01:17:31.120 and that thing seems to in your words be
01:17:33.600 emanating love and understanding while
01:17:35.920 ever changing completely formless and
01:17:37.840 communicating love and understanding
01:17:40.080 it for i can't help but think that that
01:17:42.480 should become our priority to have a
01:17:46.800 relationship with that realm and to
01:17:49.120 bring about that experience i don't even
01:17:51.440 mean in a literal way because even
01:17:52.640 terence mckenna said there were some
01:17:53.760 people
01:17:54.719 vulnerable souls he was probably
01:17:56.080 referring to people like me that
01:17:57.520 probably shouldn't mess around with that
01:17:59.440 kind of thing he was really talking
01:18:00.719 about people's schizophrenia right which
01:18:02.880 he believed he had by the way did he
01:18:05.280 yeah he he he had some very unique uh
01:18:08.000 perspectives on schizophrenia and the
01:18:10.320 the way people interact with the world
01:18:12.480 itself i think if we lived in a healthy
01:18:14.480 world uh a healthy civilization that had
01:18:17.040 a healthy relationship with psychoactive
01:18:18.800 substances we'd probably have centers
01:18:21.199 where you would have a legitimate shaman
01:18:23.199 a medical advisor and someone would take
01:18:25.199 you through a guided experience
01:18:28.560 we're doing that now with uh ketamine
01:18:31.199 there's a lot of people that are very
01:18:32.560 depressed that are having these
01:18:35.880 physician-controlled ketamine
01:18:37.520 experiences that have had a profound
01:18:39.920 effect on their depression my friend
01:18:42.320 neil brennan's gone through several of
01:18:43.760 them and he was
01:18:45.520 he's a comedian a very funny comedian so
01:18:47.280 when he was describing it was hilarious
01:18:49.360 going to a doctor's office and tripping
01:18:50.960 his [ __ ] balls off
01:18:52.560 you know and the doctor's shooting him
01:18:54.640 up with intramuscular ketamine oh my god
01:18:56.960 yeah and he's having these insane so i
01:18:59.280 go see you're having psychedelic
01:19:00.560 experiences like oh yeah
01:19:04.080 describing it was really funny
01:19:06.239 um i mean tripping his [ __ ] balls off
01:19:09.600 in these whatever
01:19:11.760 states that ketamine i've never
01:19:13.920 experienced ketamine i don't know what
01:19:15.040 it does but it's apparently profoundly
01:19:17.679 uh hallucinogenic and you have these
01:19:20.080 wild crazy experiences on it and for
01:19:22.640 whatever reason it has a great impact on
01:19:25.760 depression for a lot of people i think
01:19:27.440 it's a prospective enhancer but it also
01:19:29.120 does something to rewire the mind well
01:19:31.360 what some of this suggests is that
01:19:33.120 mental illness is a response to our
01:19:35.120 material conditions whether that's
01:19:36.880 whether that mental illness is
01:19:37.920 schizophrenia depression or
01:19:40.159 addiction it's like like people are
01:19:42.080 going hang on a minute this isn't how
01:19:43.440 we're supposed to live i took that i
01:19:45.360 mean one time towards the end of my
01:19:47.440 using and as usual it's not in the right
01:19:49.520 type of environment you should be doing
01:19:50.560 stuff like that in a nightclub you need
01:19:52.000 to be under that shamanic conditions
01:19:53.920 white guy or whatever whoever you
01:19:56.080 nominate as a shaman but i feel like it
01:19:57.920 was like going into a tunnel made of
01:20:00.000 sound and like having to navigate i was
01:20:02.080 like oh [ __ ] i'm still in reality what
01:20:04.000 am i going to do is it
01:20:05.760 as my sort of consciousness becomes a
01:20:07.920 noise instead of a string of words and
01:20:10.800 signs how am i going to get out of this
01:20:12.800 place you know so like for me it's clear
01:20:15.360 that drugs were never meant to be
01:20:16.719 recreational in fact they never were i
01:20:18.640 was never hey man this is crazy i was
01:20:20.560 like i'm in [ __ ] pain i need some
01:20:22.080 [ __ ] to help me out otherwise i'm gonna
01:20:24.080 probably kill myself yeah you know so
01:20:25.760 like it was a way of holding that stuff
01:20:28.080 at arm's length so i guess my renewed
01:20:30.640 curiosity around dmt and iowa and
01:20:32.880 ayahuasca and other sort of plant
01:20:34.960 medicines and like you know that do you
01:20:36.159 know daniel pinchberg and like them guys
01:20:38.080 that are sort of part of that i'm
01:20:39.679 curious about it because i guess i'm
01:20:41.440 continually trying to find a way where
01:20:42.719 someone go right here's a way where we
01:20:44.000 can do it where it's sort of safe and
01:20:45.679 i've heard of other people in recovery
01:20:47.199 doing it and when i think about what my
01:20:48.719 motivation is is when i hear people
01:20:50.719 talking about and my own and my own
01:20:52.320 recollections of experiencing what felt
01:20:54.159 like god and by god i mean a sense of
01:20:55.760 oneness and that my individual identity
01:20:57.360 isn't my real identity and i'm connected
01:20:58.960 to everything and love is the most
01:21:00.320 important thing you know i i i want a
01:21:03.280 real experience of that so that when i'm
01:21:04.960 out in the world i can remember when i'm
01:21:07.040 driving or when i'm dealing with people
01:21:08.800 or if i'm buying something or if i'm
01:21:10.400 feeling inferior or feeling superior
01:21:12.400 that like you said this is [ __ ] this
01:21:14.719 is like a secondary reality don't let it
01:21:16.400 govern you you know as a someone that's
01:21:17.920 been seduced by fame a person like if i
01:21:20.320 get this part in this film then
01:21:21.679 everyone's gonna love me oh if this
01:21:22.960 stand up set goes well you know like a
01:21:24.640 person has placed all of my well-being
01:21:26.560 outside of myself the certain knowledge
01:21:28.800 that there is an inner connection that
01:21:30.320 will take care of you that's accessible
01:21:32.880 i guess i'm you know hungry to sort of
01:21:35.920 feel it in a way that's like oh my god
01:21:37.760 now there is no doubt so in a sense it's
01:21:39.360 a crisis of faith not christ
01:21:41.840 psychedelic states that you could
01:21:43.600 achieve without
01:21:45.120 taking anything i mean you could
01:21:46.640 certainly get there um in a flotation
01:21:49.679 tank you could get there through
01:21:51.280 holotropic breathing
01:21:53.120 i've never done kundalini yoga but
01:21:55.840 apparently the people that get really
01:21:57.520 deep into kundalini yoga can literally
01:21:59.520 have dmt trips
01:22:01.280 i know i have friends that have done dmt
01:22:03.920 and have experienced dmt trips through
01:22:05.920 kundalini but you have to be really
01:22:07.840 dedicated i mean there's a lot of time a
01:22:10.000 lot a lot of time a lot of energy and
01:22:12.080 you have to really understand the the
01:22:14.159 methods and and follow them to a t and
01:22:16.800 you can achieve these
01:22:18.480 altered states of consciousness that are
01:22:19.920 apparently
01:22:21.280 you know not from my personal experience
01:22:22.880 but from what people tell me incredibly
01:22:24.639 profound yeah i mean i've had comparable
01:22:26.800 things i guess that what it's you know
01:22:28.480 the difference between feeling something
01:22:30.400 that's that overwhelming that gives you
01:22:32.480 no choice you know like there's like
01:22:34.159 it's not like you know kundalini you've
01:22:35.360 got to do these breasts correctly you've
01:22:36.480 got to sit there you've got try again
01:22:37.520 have you done it yeah i don't know quite
01:22:38.960 a bit
01:22:40.960 well what for me it feels like what i
01:22:42.560 felt quite a lot yogically and
01:22:44.400 meditatively is a cessation of what i
01:22:47.120 would call my individual consciousness
01:22:48.960 like oh i'm not this this isn't who i am
01:22:51.520 this is just a temporary experience and
01:22:53.440 all of the value systems of our world
01:22:55.760 are built upon these primal drives in
01:22:58.800 collaboration with a culture that likes
01:23:00.960 to stratify people and manage people and
01:23:02.960 operates like a massive farm where it's
01:23:05.120 easier to keep people together operating
01:23:06.800 in these kind of ways systemically i've
01:23:08.400 sort of felt rushes of that like a
01:23:10.159 certain wordless clarity if you can
01:23:12.880 imagine me having anything that was
01:23:14.320 wordless even for a moment and like and
01:23:16.560 in that space you know there is there is
01:23:18.800 great peace so i suppose like what's
01:23:21.280 turning me on about the like the dmt and
01:23:23.679 i wesker thing is that the way it's
01:23:25.280 narrativized that they're gonna meet
01:23:27.280 characters and stuff like that and it's
01:23:29.280 and it's gonna be plain and beyond doubt
01:23:31.760 you know because i suppose what prophets
01:23:33.920 do you know like whether you know when a
01:23:36.639 prophet returns from the whether it's
01:23:38.639 the burning bush or the cave they come
01:23:41.199 back and they say all this stuff that
01:23:43.040 you're taking seriously is not real
01:23:45.040 there's this other realm start
01:23:46.719 prioritizing it or you are going to live
01:23:49.199 in hell on earth you're going to be
01:23:50.960 governed by your materialistic drives
01:23:52.560 your sexual drives and it's going to
01:23:54.000 imprison you and it turns out that
01:23:56.639 they're right and so like you know i
01:23:58.560 suppose what i'm after because i'm
01:24:01.199 partly you know on a super like on one
01:24:03.280 level influenced by what you're doing
01:24:04.880 and how you've created your own like you
01:24:06.960 create your own business and your own
01:24:08.560 success like this this symbiosis of
01:24:10.800 stand-up and the podcast and like it's
01:24:12.719 become like a sort of a lifestyle brand
01:24:14.639 in a sense joe like you know i'm sort of
01:24:16.639 like yeah i don't i don't want to be
01:24:18.400 continually dragged into these collabs
01:24:20.320 like working within institutions like
01:24:22.320 you know i'm over here doing a bloody
01:24:24.239 i'm doing ballers and i'm bloody glad to
01:24:26.080 be over here doing ballers and working
01:24:27.679 with the rock and i've got a funny story
01:24:28.880 about that if you want it
01:24:31.280 like
01:24:32.000 um
01:24:32.880 but like uh you know like really what
01:24:34.880 interests me is like can i be and then
01:24:37.440 can i dedicate my life to humorously
01:24:40.159 communicating spiritual information and
01:24:42.960 indeed starting to live it so like and i
01:24:45.679 suppose what that would mean is you know
01:24:47.120 i'm getting better that i'm not a person
01:24:49.120 who's obsessed with porn or sex or drugs
01:24:51.760 or whatever like you know to become it
01:24:53.360 to become what you actually are to
01:24:55.520 recognize that we're all different your
01:24:56.880 perfect realization of you is going to
01:24:58.639 involve
01:24:59.520 hunt in and all of these things that
01:25:01.040 you've created through your gift and
01:25:02.880 that my perfect version of me is going
01:25:04.320 to you know involve all of this and not
01:25:05.600 everyone needs to be sort of empires or
01:25:07.360 entertainment industries or whatever but
01:25:08.880 all of us are on some journey to
01:25:10.840 self-actualization and realization as
01:25:12.880 individual as our fingerprints and as
01:25:14.480 natural as a seed turning into a tree
01:25:16.480 and if we don't have a way of accessing
01:25:18.480 that no wonder we're dissatisfied no
01:25:19.920 wonder we're there's an opioid epidemic
01:25:21.679 no wonder people are bored and angry and
01:25:23.679 lonely well i think what you can do
01:25:27.760 is be yourself and what you can do is
01:25:29.760 express yourself and what you can do is
01:25:31.440 constantly seek to improve and grow and
01:25:33.600 you're doing those things so if you're
01:25:35.440 saying can i do these things can i be
01:25:37.920 comedic and spiritual and well you're
01:25:40.000 doing it
01:25:41.040 right so it can be done so it's do
01:25:43.040 you're doing it you know it's all just a
01:25:44.960 matter of what
01:25:46.159 whether or not you're satisfied with
01:25:48.080 your progress and where you are and who
01:25:50.000 you are and how you express yourself so
01:25:51.679 your pursuit for excellence when you're
01:25:53.520 saying i've got to get better at bjj or
01:25:55.360 archery or hunting or whatever that
01:25:57.199 isn't coupled with a sort of sense
01:25:59.280 because you're not [ __ ] good enough
01:26:00.880 so that's that's the no it's deal that
01:26:02.400 i've got there's wonderment yeah i love
01:26:04.800 it joy that's just joy in it and there's
01:26:07.520 enthusiasm
01:26:08.400 i mean in everything and archery in
01:26:10.719 particular it's very you know there's
01:26:13.440 that book zen in the art of archery
01:26:15.199 which is uh
01:26:16.320 it's an interesting book uh it's
01:26:18.960 you know i mean i think there's some
01:26:20.159 really great points to it but that state
01:26:22.480 of mind that you get when you release an
01:26:24.800 arrow and that arrow perfectly finds its
01:26:27.120 mark really is and
01:26:28.960 it's you it requires so much
01:26:30.880 concentration and focus and technique
01:26:32.639 that you really don't think about other
01:26:34.560 things beautiful and it's cleansing in a
01:26:36.239 lot of ways it's mind cleansing i find
01:26:38.639 jiu jitsu to be very similar in that way
01:26:40.239 too that it's so all-encompassing it's
01:26:42.880 so there's so much on the line it's so
01:26:45.040 difficult to do that while it's
01:26:47.199 happening you're freeing your mind up i
01:26:49.199 mean i think of video games in the same
01:26:50.719 way all of these things so that's
01:26:52.639 bizarre but like
01:26:54.400 all of those things suggest a
01:26:55.840 transmission between the inner and outer
01:26:57.760 worlds isn't it you're looking at the
01:26:59.360 bull's-eye and then oh my god i've made
01:27:02.320 this thing traverse time and space or
01:27:04.719 bjj i've been shown again and again how
01:27:06.800 to execute this triangle and i've just
01:27:08.480 actually done it against resistance it's
01:27:11.520 amazing to feel that it's amazing to
01:27:13.920 feel that your inner life can express
01:27:16.000 itself in the material world whatever
01:27:18.400 wherever you're looking to explore that
01:27:20.480 and to test yourself and when you test
01:27:23.040 yourself and you have to
01:27:24.960 figure your way through something or
01:27:27.920 change the path because the path you're
01:27:30.080 on was unsuccessful when you're doing
01:27:32.000 that it's it's really good for the mind
01:27:34.239 and for the i don't i hesitate to say
01:27:36.639 the spirit because i think that word
01:27:38.000 spirituality is so beaten down and
01:27:40.159 abused you know what do you mean it's
01:27:41.280 become commodified yeah it's like yeah
01:27:43.760 it's like when people call themselves a
01:27:45.120 healer like are you really yeah i've
01:27:47.040 just done some healing on the way here
01:27:50.239 with that guy we're all healing
01:27:52.480 um i mean we really are all healing each
01:27:54.960 other but um i think there's something
01:27:58.000 to doing difficult tasks that it makes
01:28:00.560 life easier i really believe that i
01:28:02.400 think it makes life more enjoyable i
01:28:04.639 think it makes the bright colors
01:28:06.480 brighter and and it makes the the dull
01:28:09.120 colors even them even the the bad
01:28:12.000 moments if you have real positive
01:28:14.400 experiences with difficult things that
01:28:15.920 you choose to do on your own i think it
01:28:18.000 mitigates most of the hassle of life yes
01:28:20.880 i agree with that that is again and i'm
01:28:23.120 not particularly promoting this book
01:28:24.159 because like uh i'm all right with
01:28:26.800 however things do but the point of this
01:28:28.560 mentorship is the idea that someone will
01:28:30.560 exhibit qualities that you recognize you
01:28:32.800 don't haven't fully realized in yourself
01:28:34.719 and that you can sort of model them and
01:28:36.560 realize them because latently you have
01:28:38.639 those qualities oh like kevin hart we
01:28:40.400 were talking about how adorable i find
01:28:42.000 his positivity it made me think it's so
01:28:44.159 real it's unbelievable on a practical
01:28:45.920 level
01:28:46.880 the way he's building his stand up that
01:28:49.120 guy's [ __ ] diligent and the amount
01:28:50.960 when he talked through his when he
01:28:52.239 talked through his work schedule you
01:28:53.920 quite you fetishize hard-working men i
01:28:56.000 think i've heard you talk about dwayne
01:28:57.280 johnson and kevin hart yeah like like
01:28:59.920 you like the idea of men i'm up at those
01:29:01.840 people too i'm in the cryo chamber i
01:29:04.080 don't do that though i sleep in
01:29:06.480 i can't tell you what you can do a lot
01:29:08.719 of things that they don't do like i but
01:29:11.040 i also
01:29:12.159 you know unlike uh the rock at least i
01:29:14.480 do stand up i mean kevin does stand up
01:29:16.159 too obviously i don't know if he does it
01:29:18.000 as much or as often as i do but because
01:29:20.560 i do the clubs i have a philosophy about
01:29:23.840 what's required
01:29:25.440 to develop great stand-up that you have
01:29:27.440 to do a lot of sets you have to do a lot
01:29:30.159 of numbers a lot of different places
01:29:32.159 different environments and i found that
01:29:33.760 out the hard way through my best
01:29:35.440 performances and my less good
01:29:37.120 performances like what was missing and
01:29:38.800 what did i gain
01:29:40.159 you like this i think is a sort of an
01:29:42.320 interesting debate
01:29:44.080 you know i don't know if it's in
01:29:45.120 stand-up world at large but certainly
01:29:46.800 thing i've thought about a lot is like
01:29:48.480 that as soon as i was able to have an
01:29:51.040 audience that would come and see me i
01:29:53.280 was like i'm out thank you god
01:29:56.239 you know i'm not putting myself through
01:29:58.000 that [ __ ] ever again doug stanhope feels
01:30:01.120 the same way by the way dad he's one of
01:30:02.560 the best yeah he's amazing he's
01:30:04.239 absolutely fantastic i completely agree
01:30:06.320 and like because i thought like because
01:30:08.000 what i feel like is that the comedy club
01:30:09.840 environment warps your material because
01:30:12.400 you've got a appeal to them and i think
01:30:14.560 you ain't the [ __ ] arbiters of truth
01:30:17.040 you've drunk crazy 2am [ __ ]
01:30:20.639 so i get like i perform oh what i'll do
01:30:22.960 is like and what i'm doing say at the
01:30:24.159 moment is i'll book the ucb like or like
01:30:27.280 places 100 200 or go largo or put on
01:30:30.080 events and i'm doing events while i'm in
01:30:31.679 l.a because i think oh these people come
01:30:33.760 and they love me and they bring me beads
01:30:36.960 here's some vegan cookies you gotta come
01:30:39.280 to the comedy store man go on after joey
01:30:41.280 diaz
01:30:46.080 because i feel like i like a nurturing
01:30:48.239 environment
01:30:49.199 i mean because i've done that i've done
01:30:50.639 those [ __ ] clubs and like you know
01:30:52.639 and even comedy store and late at night
01:30:54.560 comedy store in l.a you know as well as
01:30:56.639 london and i feel like oh jesus thank
01:30:58.800 god and after so like i'm interested to
01:31:00.719 you that's part of that what i think
01:31:02.560 some people could reductively refer to
01:31:04.320 as mcchismo in you like that you go no
01:31:07.440 i'm going in there well you know what it
01:31:09.199 is it's that guy that mounted you and
01:31:11.920 went for the armbar and you escaped
01:31:13.679 right it's worth it because it was hard
01:31:16.800 you like you realize if a child got on
01:31:19.280 top of you and went for an arm bar and
01:31:20.639 you escaped you'd feel nothing
01:31:22.320 so when you're at largo you're you're
01:31:24.320 performing for children
01:31:28.080 you're doing child stand up it's like
01:31:30.400 you're wrestling with a hundred pound
01:31:32.480 women who just started yesterday it's
01:31:34.560 like the make-a-wish foundation go on
01:31:36.719 russell then tell us your stories well
01:31:38.719 if you've noticed amazing
01:31:40.480 you're wonderful
01:31:42.400 thank you thank you children but but
01:31:44.639 like look the counter argument to that
01:31:46.400 is that therefore i'm in an environment
01:31:49.520 that is sympathetic and it is my
01:31:51.679 audience and i'm not biasing i what you
01:31:55.040 know the idea of overcoming a greater
01:31:57.120 obstacle i completely appreciate what
01:31:59.040 you're saying but say you believe in the
01:32:00.960 purity of stand up as being some real
01:32:03.199 expression of yourself as in the arrow
01:32:05.520 hitting the bull's eye i feel like i
01:32:07.520 have a vision of what i'm trying to
01:32:08.880 achieve and increasingly it's becoming
01:32:11.840 about i want my stand up i want to hang
01:32:14.239 on you know like as i've always done
01:32:15.920 stories where i feel embarrassed and
01:32:17.199 humiliated but i want to hang off it
01:32:19.440 ruminations on what i believe to be the
01:32:21.760 nature of truth and i want people to
01:32:23.120 come out of those things feeling loved
01:32:24.560 validated accepted and that they're good
01:32:26.560 enough and that they can explore
01:32:27.760 themselves you know that's more of a
01:32:29.199 one-man show in a sense it's that but i
01:32:31.440 don't want to like sacrifice the last
01:32:33.280 you know i mean i love the last the last
01:32:35.199 what is where we're at you know that's
01:32:36.880 what you don't have to sacrifice in a
01:32:38.239 one-man show i mean you can certainly do
01:32:39.840 a one-man show that would be really
01:32:41.360 funny but say you start going into yeah
01:32:43.600 that's what i'm doing and i'm like i'm
01:32:44.719 trying to build things like around 12
01:32:46.159 steps and trying to like doing things
01:32:47.760 that people have some take away value
01:32:49.679 from now like you know like trying to
01:32:51.440 develop that after joey diaz in the
01:32:53.600 store that's not going to happen
01:32:55.600 there's going to be some resistance you
01:32:57.040 are you aware of hannah gatsby and the
01:32:59.600 controversy what do you think about it
01:33:01.760 i haven't seen it yeah
01:33:03.840 i'm going to see it but because what the
01:33:05.280 end of comedy and all that kind of thing
01:33:06.880 it's silly it's no end of comedy but she
01:33:09.199 what she's doing people like and there's
01:33:11.520 nothing
01:33:12.320 i don't know you call it whatever you
01:33:13.600 want sometimes it's funny i mean maybe
01:33:15.360 it's stand-up comedy
01:33:18.000 towards the end it like becomes sort of
01:33:19.600 quite aggressive towards the audience
01:33:20.960 yeah it became like a ted talk almost i
01:33:23.199 guess apparently i'm interested oh you
01:33:24.880 know that's you know yeah there's enough
01:33:26.080 room for everyone to experience to do
01:33:27.920 whatever they're doing but like see at
01:33:29.840 the beginning of my uh let's call it
01:33:31.600 career like i used to not prepare at all
01:33:34.400 i was still drinking the union i'd go up
01:33:35.840 on stage i'd chop [ __ ] up i'd get into
01:33:37.760 confrontation like i'm when i say chop
01:33:39.280 chop i'd take up animals [ __ ] animal
01:33:42.239 parts i'd go from butchers like like a
01:33:44.080 skull with all meat and stuff and sinew
01:33:46.480 on it chop it up friend they'll just
01:33:48.080 release locusts get into confrontations
01:33:50.800 and like so yeah exactly the reaction
01:33:52.639 you're having is the reaction they were
01:33:54.000 having like the same as the front row i
01:33:56.000 had like
01:33:57.040 fights i've got scars on my body from
01:33:58.880 bad stand up gigs from a time where i go
01:34:00.800 into a confrontation like i was making a
01:34:03.280 point about pedophilia saying oh we're
01:34:04.960 all one cultural mind so when a
01:34:06.560 particular pedophile is transgressed
01:34:08.320 against a child we're all responsible
01:34:09.920 people like what the [ __ ] and i i'm like
01:34:13.600 i got the [ __ ] kicked out with that time
01:34:15.199 you know i've still got the scar on my
01:34:16.400 leg that happened to edinburgh in
01:34:17.679 scotland people didn't take it well
01:34:20.400 like so but what i was trying to do was
01:34:22.880 like create i didn't have the skills the
01:34:25.120 chops the experience the jokes so i was
01:34:27.679 so under equipped but like what i was
01:34:29.840 trying to do was create environments
01:34:32.719 that felt you know i'm much better at
01:34:34.080 doing that now i can create that kind of
01:34:36.080 an uncertainty in a room a kind of a
01:34:37.920 sense of chaos and what's happening and
01:34:39.840 then bring it back i hope to a humorous
01:34:42.639 conclusion where people feel safe and
01:34:44.159 amused and all of that kind of stuff now
01:34:45.760 i think it's you you can't like because
01:34:47.679 i did try and do that in comedy clubs
01:34:49.360 and yeah it was confrontational it's not
01:34:50.800 what people want so don't you think that
01:34:52.719 by prepping your stand up in those uh
01:34:55.360 environments that it biases you towards
01:34:57.920 a type of stand-up comedy in is limited
01:35:01.199 no because you can do that other stuff
01:35:03.120 too you could always perform to your
01:35:05.280 crowd and you could always expand on
01:35:07.360 things to your crowd but to really put
01:35:10.320 it together without any fluff without
01:35:14.239 any nonsense without being
01:35:16.440 self-indulgent with respecting the
01:35:19.199 attention span of the audience that may
01:35:20.880 or may not even be there to see you most
01:35:22.560 likely is not if you go to a comedy club
01:35:24.320 and there's a large you know if you go
01:35:26.480 to the comedy store any night of the
01:35:27.679 week there's 15 plus people on the
01:35:29.600 marquee or on the the list and the show
01:35:32.320 starts at
01:35:33.440 8 p.m or 9 p.m depending on the night
01:35:35.440 and it goes to 2 o'clock in the morning
01:35:37.280 and you know you catch waves in there
01:35:39.520 and there's different types of comedy
01:35:42.159 and in that you're gonna deal with
01:35:44.159 sometimes tired audiences sometimes
01:35:46.639 enthusiastic people it's all different
01:35:48.639 it varies widely and i think that um
01:35:51.760 in doing that you cut all the nonsense
01:35:54.400 out of your act and you you develop
01:35:56.719 economy of words you understand how to
01:35:58.880 captivate people's attention and keep
01:36:00.560 them engaged and to respect their time
01:36:03.440 respect their point of view respect that
01:36:06.080 these people have an attention span they
01:36:07.679 want to be engaged in in the best
01:36:10.159 possible way that you can do it and
01:36:11.920 sometimes you develop that
01:36:14.000 through these really difficult sets or
01:36:16.639 you know distracted people and drunks
01:36:18.880 and all that stuff you can develop that
01:36:20.719 those qualities you're always going to
01:36:22.639 have your crowd and
01:36:25.280 your crowd i mean if you have this this
01:36:26.960 vision of how you want to put things
01:36:28.159 together you can put that kind of thing
01:36:30.320 together at a comedy club you're doing
01:36:32.159 it in these 15-minute chunks you just
01:36:33.600 have to figure out a way to grab them
01:36:35.199 yes and make them really interested in
01:36:37.440 what you have to say you're right
01:36:38.800 because there's a obviously in like the
01:36:40.960 comedy store between the hours you just
01:36:42.880 just described there's a contract we're
01:36:44.719 here not really at cu we're here to
01:36:46.800 laugh every 15 seconds and like you know
01:36:48.880 comics like you know like robin williams
01:36:51.440 or chappelle's the the you know the
01:36:52.960 all-time greats they when they go in and
01:36:55.520 accept those conditions and you know
01:36:57.520 you've seen stuff i'm sure like of robin
01:36:59.679 williams he's just like walking around
01:37:01.199 in the crowd in that very room it's like
01:37:03.199 he's like he's doing the thing i'm
01:37:04.960 talking about and he's doing it there
01:37:07.119 yeah that's when you think yeah if like
01:37:09.119 i suppose i do get that that you're road
01:37:11.199 testing it to a it's durability to an
01:37:13.920 incredible degree if you can pull it off
01:37:15.360 there yeah well think about every time
01:37:16.960 you're saying something
01:37:18.800 when you you have a subject like say if
01:37:20.719 you want to do uh you want to talk about
01:37:22.560 the mentors that you have in life
01:37:24.719 there's it's an open-ended approach you
01:37:26.800 have no idea
01:37:28.400 what the correct way to say something is
01:37:30.880 you try it you you write it out you say
01:37:33.520 this seems feasible let me try it this
01:37:36.080 way and oftentimes people never correct
01:37:38.320 it or they never they never adjust it
01:37:40.480 they never go back and improve it they
01:37:42.560 just say it in a certain way and figure
01:37:44.159 out how to do it when you're doing it in
01:37:46.560 front of a crowd you're developing these
01:37:48.880 things while also feeling the way people
01:37:52.159 are reacting to them and feeling their
01:37:54.320 attention span and it makes you with
01:37:57.840 proper reflection and truly objective
01:38:00.719 listening to your material it makes you
01:38:03.199 change and shift and adjust things you
01:38:05.280 know hopefully in a positive way get in
01:38:07.760 and the more you do it the more you get
01:38:09.600 a sense of maybe this is clunky here and
01:38:12.159 maybe i figure out a better way to say
01:38:13.920 it and
01:38:15.119 i agree but the counter argument could
01:38:16.639 be that it could bias you to a sort of a
01:38:18.400 lowest common denominator area say with
01:38:20.960 that bit where you talk about the sun
01:38:23.119 and you know it's you know it you need
01:38:25.040 it it's trying to kill you it gives you
01:38:26.400 cancer you know like something like
01:38:28.880 what was the journey of that bit of
01:38:31.920 stand-up is this like like for me it's
01:38:33.360 like oh i think before i try and make
01:38:35.760 sure there's a tag so i know where i'm
01:38:37.119 going when i'm out there
01:38:38.960 and then it's a comparable process to
01:38:41.600 yours you're trying your best to get rid
01:38:42.960 of fluff or whatever yeah so can you
01:38:44.960 recall like what it's like you know you
01:38:47.520 night after night going in with new bits
01:38:49.440 of material packaged within
01:38:51.840 things that you're a little more
01:38:52.560 confident in yeah and i put that bit on
01:38:54.400 a special i can do it better now i know
01:38:57.040 a better way to do it and that's part of
01:38:58.960 the problem with doing bits it's like
01:39:00.880 sometimes you release them on a special
01:39:02.639 you have a better version of it now
01:39:04.800 but my point of that was to a
01:39:07.199 perspective enhancer to let people know
01:39:09.119 that bit was about like understand
01:39:10.960 what's happening here you are literally
01:39:13.440 floating in infinity and it's almost
01:39:15.679 never discussed you're hurling through
01:39:18.239 forever there's a fireball in the sky
01:39:20.480 it's a million times bigger than earth
01:39:22.480 if you stare at it you'll go blind it's
01:39:24.320 trying to give you cancer and if it's
01:39:25.679 not there you get sad
01:39:27.360 yeah you live in a dream like this is
01:39:29.199 madness your life is madness
01:39:31.840 it's beautiful yeah it is but i wanted
01:39:35.040 there's something about that particular
01:39:37.920 way of exp see because i figured out a
01:39:40.239 way to express it
01:39:42.560 in short doses and short bursts if you
01:39:45.600 know if you stare at it it'll go blind
01:39:48.080 it's trying to give you cancer and if
01:39:49.199 it's not there you get sad so in that
01:39:51.199 short burst like it's you know like wow
01:39:52.960 yeah that is all those things are true
01:39:54.400 like this is crazy there really is a
01:39:56.400 fireball floating in the sky we're just
01:39:58.560 used to it we live because of a floating
01:40:01.920 million times bigger than the earth
01:40:03.199 fireball and i
01:40:04.719 when you say if you could say something
01:40:07.040 like that and make someone laugh you can
01:40:09.280 actually change
01:40:11.119 the way they look at things you can
01:40:12.880 actually affect at least the way they
01:40:14.639 look at things if you just say something
01:40:17.440 sometimes it's profound sometimes it
01:40:19.360 registers but if you could say something
01:40:21.600 and it forces someone to laugh even if
01:40:23.280 they disagree with you if they're
01:40:24.960 laughing like i don't even [ __ ] agree
01:40:26.880 with this but holy [ __ ] this is funny
01:40:28.719 you put that thought deep into someone's
01:40:31.360 head and you allow them to
01:40:33.920 think about your thought process and and
01:40:36.719 how your creative process and what
01:40:38.719 you're doing to sort of bring these
01:40:40.880 things out yes i like the way you just
01:40:43.600 describe the architecture of that you've
01:40:45.280 got to basically have these are some
01:40:47.280 facts about the sun irrefutable yeah now
01:40:50.239 here is how that affects the way we look
01:40:52.719 at the world and exposes to us that
01:40:54.400 we're just ignorant we're not awake to
01:40:56.800 reality we can't hold reality in our
01:40:59.440 minds because it's too
01:41:00.960 vast to handle
01:41:02.800 i like it and i agree with you that you
01:41:05.199 know that with laughter comes access to
01:41:07.679 kind of deeper truths and i've heard
01:41:09.040 some therapists in fact say that uh like
01:41:11.679 the
01:41:12.639 laughter is to shame what grief is to
01:41:15.280 sadness that laughter is helping to
01:41:17.600 expel shame and to process shame there's
01:41:20.159 something very important about people
01:41:22.239 coming together and laughing together
01:41:25.040 i i like to exist comedically in a world
01:41:27.280 where it's like starts from a deeply
01:41:28.800 personal perspective and admissions and
01:41:30.320 acknowledgments of humiliation and shame
01:41:32.080 and vulnerability and travels out to the
01:41:34.960 universal and hopefully archetypal that
01:41:37.040 you can sort of travel between those
01:41:38.239 points with the comedian nothing we both
01:41:40.560 admire bill hicks what i think is
01:41:42.480 fascinating is because like you know
01:41:43.760 like if you've loved bill hicks for a
01:41:45.679 long while then you discover
01:41:47.760 man that guy works material a lot you
01:41:50.800 know like you go i watch this interview
01:41:52.239 with him on the australian tv he's doing
01:41:54.480 like a bit that i've seen him do you
01:41:56.320 know in multiple
01:41:58.040 incarnations but i have also seen him do
01:42:00.480 interviews where he's spontaneously
01:42:02.159 talking about gigs terrible gigs that
01:42:03.840 have gone badly and he is hilarious but
01:42:05.600 it's very interesting to me and perhaps
01:42:06.960 it's because of that background and that
01:42:08.719 practice of doing clubs that hicks is
01:42:11.440 very much a comedian that's no i'm
01:42:14.480 drilling this [ __ ] thing and i'm
01:42:16.080 staying with it no he was a writer i
01:42:17.679 mean he he did ad-lib and he did he was
01:42:20.480 capable of going on these rants
01:42:22.719 spontaneous rants but he was a writer
01:42:24.719 you know he wrote these things out and
01:42:26.400 he was aiming to have an impact with his
01:42:28.639 commentary
01:42:29.840 i mean that was what was was he was
01:42:31.679 doing he was not just trying to make you
01:42:33.360 laugh he was aiming to enhance your your
01:42:36.000 perspective on whatever he was talking
01:42:38.000 about yeah and as a it was seems very
01:42:40.400 disciplined as a practitioner of it
01:42:42.239 whereas like say a chappelle it feels
01:42:43.920 like he's just going
01:42:45.840 like an hour well you know he's got a
01:42:47.679 very unique process
01:42:49.280 chappelle does and he can turn over an
01:42:51.840 hour like no one have ever seen before
01:42:53.520 and i was talking to donnell wrongs
01:42:54.880 about it recently who you know was on
01:42:56.480 this propel show with him he's like we
01:42:58.080 both agreed like he's the best ever at
01:43:00.480 turning over a new hour he can have a
01:43:02.480 new he could release a netflix special
01:43:05.199 and then have a new hour within a couple
01:43:06.800 of weeks
01:43:07.840 it doesn't even make sense i don't i
01:43:09.280 don't understand how he's doing it he
01:43:10.880 must just flood in he's just he's in a
01:43:13.679 great space you know he's in a great
01:43:16.080 mindset to do comedy you know if if you
01:43:18.800 pay attention to how you know when when
01:43:21.520 people study like if you read outliers
01:43:24.719 and you read how people when people
01:43:27.360 study why people are great at what they
01:43:30.239 do what makes them exceptional there's
01:43:32.159 always a variety of factors and whatever
01:43:34.880 the factors are with dave he's got this
01:43:37.840 easy going personality this like very
01:43:40.400 carefully carefree way of looking at
01:43:42.800 things he's also gone through a lot of
01:43:44.880 [ __ ] in his career with you know the
01:43:47.119 leaving the chappelle show and you know
01:43:50.159 abandoning 50 million dollars and going
01:43:52.320 to africa and really understanding what
01:43:55.199 his real motivation were he was caught
01:43:56.800 up in that world where they were trying
01:43:58.639 to change him and commercialize his
01:44:00.560 television show and he handled it as
01:44:03.760 good as anybody that's ever handled it
01:44:05.520 yeah he he handled fame and temptation
01:44:08.800 i think better than anyone i've ever
01:44:10.159 heard of he just said [ __ ] you
01:44:12.639 and he just went away he went away and
01:44:14.719 then didn't do gigs for years people
01:44:17.119 understand he would show up and do
01:44:19.520 stand-up places but he wouldn't book
01:44:21.119 anything
01:44:22.400 so like he wasn't getting paid he was
01:44:24.960 just he did stand up dave chappelle did
01:44:27.440 stand up in the park in seattle he
01:44:29.840 brought like a little amplifier and a
01:44:31.600 microphone set up and just started doing
01:44:34.159 stand up and people just gathered round
01:44:36.560 and he did this just to sort of get him
01:44:38.560 back in touch with his roots because he
01:44:40.239 used to do a lot of street performing in
01:44:41.679 new york and i saw him do street
01:44:43.840 performing in montreal we did a club and
01:44:46.000 then we came out of the club and dave i
01:44:48.159 think dave was like 18 or 19 at a time
01:44:50.239 just started doing stand up on the
01:44:51.520 street
01:44:52.639 and put his hat out and people would put
01:44:54.080 money in his hat i mean he was uh
01:44:56.400 constantly sharpening that sword
01:44:59.119 and he stopped doing stand up for a long
01:45:01.920 time in terms of like booking gigs and
01:45:04.960 then after a while i said [ __ ] it i'm
01:45:06.400 gonna come back again and then he
01:45:07.760 started doing these gigantic gigs and
01:45:09.679 then of course he did his two recent uh
01:45:11.920 netflix specials were amongst his best
01:45:13.760 work ever and you know and now he's he's
01:45:16.480 working all the time he's constantly
01:45:18.480 popping into the comedy store and the
01:45:20.000 comedy seller and all these different
01:45:21.360 clubs all across the country and
01:45:23.360 constantly doing stand-up and no social
01:45:25.840 media just not not involved in any of
01:45:28.239 that stuff doesn't do anything just just
01:45:30.560 performs just does this stuff yeah
01:45:32.639 that's interesting when it's like i
01:45:36.000 i feel that some people have like found
01:45:38.480 their essence and found their path and
01:45:41.040 live it
01:45:42.000 and like they you know that like they're
01:45:43.920 a yogi or a priest or something that's
01:45:46.080 right he's just got a devotional this is
01:45:47.679 who i am i'm not doing anything that's
01:45:49.600 not that and it yeah that's exhibited
01:45:52.239 even in earlier stuff prior to the cri
01:45:54.480 that you know what you just you know the
01:45:56.000 crisis of the 50 million walk away thing
01:45:58.639 like by then if he was at 18 doing them
01:46:00.880 clubs he was hardened like what that
01:46:03.600 what seemed so loose on stage was
01:46:05.280 something that had been refined as a
01:46:07.119 person who's comfortable yeah he was
01:46:09.360 always good he was good when i first met
01:46:11.520 him when he was like 18. i think he was
01:46:13.679 18 i was 21 so it was somewhere in that
01:46:15.679 range maybe i was a little older maybe
01:46:17.520 he was uh maybe he was like how old's
01:46:19.360 dave
01:46:20.239 46 47
01:46:22.239 i think he's five years younger than me
01:46:24.800 is that correct
01:46:26.400 46 or 47 45 okay so he's more six years
01:46:30.400 six years younger than me so you know
01:46:33.119 i was probably 25 and he was probably 18
01:46:36.960 ish 25 26 18 17 but he was um
01:46:41.920 he was so like calm and like
01:46:46.080 he was very was you were attracted to
01:46:49.199 listening to him it was like like look
01:46:51.040 at this guy like this guy's like so
01:46:53.040 comfortable in his own skin and so
01:46:55.920 friendly and easy going and hilarious
01:46:59.280 but
01:47:00.320 who he was then and then who he became
01:47:03.280 is all the work that he put in you know
01:47:05.520 it's like he had this base of this
01:47:07.280 really you know this curious young
01:47:11.280 very wise person who saw things that
01:47:13.840 other people didn't see in the world and
01:47:15.360 then he just kept going and just kept
01:47:17.520 going and then of course the chappelle
01:47:19.119 show which is
01:47:20.400 in my opinion the greatest sketch comedy
01:47:22.880 show of all time even though it was only
01:47:24.320 two seasons it's the best ever
01:47:26.960 and then after that i mean he's
01:47:29.040 basically just on stand-up and done it
01:47:31.040 completely outside of this system he's
01:47:33.199 done up some parts and movies and [ __ ]
01:47:34.800 like that but for the most part what
01:47:36.400 he's doing is just stand up completely
01:47:38.400 outside of the hollywood system
01:47:39.760 completely free
01:47:41.040 just goes up you know just talks some
01:47:43.600 [ __ ] has a couple of drinks laughs and
01:47:45.920 and and
01:47:47.040 it's incredibly compelling he's found
01:47:49.119 his groove you know and that's
01:47:51.040 it's a beautiful thing to watch as a
01:47:53.040 fellow stand-up comedy practitioner when
01:47:55.040 someone
01:47:56.000 achieves this mastery level like you
01:47:57.840 know we were talking about like this
01:47:58.800 hicks and gracie of stand-up comedy
01:48:00.960 level because that's where he's at right
01:48:02.080 now yeah i agree with you become who you
01:48:04.480 are yeah yeah
01:48:05.840 he's become himself and he doesn't have
01:48:07.679 things that are getting in the way of
01:48:08.880 that you know that's what's really
01:48:10.159 interesting like you don't see him he's
01:48:12.719 like he's not on social media he's not
01:48:14.560 on anything twitter or facebook he's not
01:48:16.880 any of that [ __ ] he doesn't pay
01:48:18.159 attention to any of it he's just
01:48:20.480 just being a person just being a person
01:48:22.560 and doing stand-up you know it's uh he
01:48:25.520 doesn't have to which is unique too you
01:48:27.600 know he doesn't have to promote things
01:48:29.360 they just sell out yeah what an amazing
01:48:31.760 example what an amazing example
01:48:34.880 i've got to promote some things oh what
01:48:36.480 do you got
01:48:37.440 the book mentors
01:48:38.400 [Laughter]
01:48:41.600 i've really learned some powerful
01:48:42.880 lessons there from the story of uh the
01:48:45.360 apotheosis of comedy that dave
01:48:46.960 chappelle's achieved here's these
01:48:48.400 obligations now i'm i'm booked here to
01:48:50.880 promote luminary my podcast has gone
01:48:52.800 behind her
01:48:54.080 a paywall on a platform called luminary
01:48:56.960 aiming to be the netflix of podcasts
01:48:59.520 meaning like that you know your model
01:49:01.440 will i imagine triumph further so like
01:49:04.320 from like this week my podcast will be
01:49:07.040 on luminary as part of their premium
01:49:08.960 content it's an app through which you'll
01:49:10.480 get all podcasts but my podcast is like
01:49:12.639 you've got
01:49:15.760 yeah i know that was in the process of
01:49:17.760 being created are you happy with that so
01:49:19.600 far because it's not launched i don't
01:49:21.440 know right you know you know like that
01:49:23.199 you're going to leave listeners behind
01:49:24.719 because it's gone behind a paywall but i
01:49:26.480 spoke to sort of like sam harris about
01:49:28.159 like
01:49:28.880 sam harris actually
01:49:30.080 told me about it me too yeah right right
01:49:33.360 and i spoke to like and what i
01:49:35.440 recognized is because like the
01:49:37.119 advertising model works obviously in
01:49:39.360 your case and i thought wow like there
01:49:42.239 it was like a good deal it was a good
01:49:44.400 deal i meant well i can carry on doing
01:49:46.000 podcasts for two three years that's you
01:49:48.080 know what this you know this and it's
01:49:49.760 supporting a lot of other content and
01:49:52.639 essentially not yielding any creative
01:49:55.440 control if people just if people
01:49:56.880 subscribe they get the premium content
01:49:58.719 my stuff how much it was like only like
01:50:00.320 five bucks a month like that yeah and
01:50:01.840 you get like trevor noel
01:50:04.560 and mine how many different podcasts i
01:50:06.719 don't know i think like when they're
01:50:07.679 premium content there's like 40 or 50
01:50:10.320 premium podcast like you know pieces of
01:50:12.639 content so like so for me i thought like
01:50:15.360 you know it felt like otherwise
01:50:18.000 podcasts wouldn't be something that i
01:50:19.360 could continue to do forever i would
01:50:21.280 every you know
01:50:22.560 because i do films or tv shows or stand
01:50:25.600 up or whatever
01:50:27.199 like a different like you know
01:50:28.800 for me it wasn't a viable thing to
01:50:31.600 pay for you know to pay for people to
01:50:33.760 run it to pay for
01:50:35.600 guests to even get to me and all that
01:50:37.119 kind of stuff you know no no do you do
01:50:39.440 ads on your podcast within i never did
01:50:42.320 before but now after this right it's an
01:50:44.320 ad free model like that's there's a
01:50:46.719 benefit to that for sure you know and a
01:50:48.480 lot of people choose to go ad free and
01:50:50.560 then they use patreon or something like
01:50:52.400 that for listener supported stuff sam
01:50:54.880 harris was doing that for a long time
01:50:56.320 but then he they had an issue with
01:50:58.080 patreon about certain censorship of
01:51:00.320 certain individuals and certain
01:51:02.000 ideological perspectives where they were
01:51:04.080 you know leaning towards left-wing
01:51:05.679 things and you know being
01:51:08.880 being restrictive towards right-wing
01:51:10.719 things and then
01:51:12.000 you know the
01:51:13.199 policing
01:51:14.320 the way people behave outside of patreon
01:51:16.960 and some people found that objectivable
01:51:18.639 so he left and
01:51:21.040 some other people left like jordan
01:51:22.320 peterson left and ah i've never entered
01:51:24.880 into patreon into those waters but uh i
01:51:27.600 know bird does it i think burr has like
01:51:29.280 one a week that he does doesn't happen
01:51:32.000 really yeah he's astonishing he's one of
01:51:34.239 the best yeah so like uh but like i feel
01:51:36.719 like uh yeah i feel like it's an all
01:51:38.880 right thing to do but even in um
01:51:41.199 like just with using things like youtube
01:51:43.280 and social media and you know like
01:51:45.440 spotify itunes or whatever like you know
01:51:47.599 as we have seen there's a point where
01:51:49.520 there is sort of censorship is a
01:51:51.599 possibility like as you discussed on the
01:51:54.239 jack like that run of episodes mate as i
01:51:56.800 said to you by text between the jack
01:51:58.560 dorsey the reaction to that your
01:52:00.239 response to the reaction through alex
01:52:02.159 jones and all that's important i thought
01:52:03.920 that was a spate of podcast that's like
01:52:06.400 this is where this medium can be the
01:52:09.360 alex jones podcast i thought was the
01:52:11.520 godfather
01:52:12.880 of podcasts have you seen the
01:52:21.280 yeah we have a guy who's hilarious his
01:52:23.360 name is paulie tune and paulie tune
01:52:25.760 makes uh animated clips for us with the
01:52:28.239 podcast and he's fantastic
01:52:30.719 and he did one of the alex jones eddie
01:52:33.119 bravo uh incident
01:52:35.440 the challenge yeah yeah well they were
01:52:37.360 there no not when he's asking him to
01:52:39.040 choke him here i went the flat earth no
01:52:41.520 this one
01:52:43.280 it's so ridiculous
01:52:45.199 here we'll play it for you
01:52:47.520 oh here what's going on what's the
01:52:49.440 matter my audio cut off yourself oh okay

01:53:11.440 okay anyways you are someone
01:53:14.159 that i could talk to
01:53:15.920 about the flat earth conspiracy you
01:53:18.560 don't believe in flat earth but you can
01:53:20.400 kind of understand where i'm coming from
01:53:22.880 what if i finance a research ship and
01:53:25.360 make a documentary i can't go away for
01:53:26.800 three months i will pay
01:53:28.480 what how much money can you raise
01:53:30.800 we're gonna need uh are you guys going

01:54:00.000 don't you have to go we're gonna send
01:54:01.280 someone else
01:54:22.560 the governor
01:54:23.920 listen to me
01:54:25.119 you really think there's people out
01:54:27.360 there campaigning for late-term
01:54:29.520 abortions you think that shit's real
01:54:32.320 yeah
01:54:45.440 so you're telling me it isn't real when
01:54:47.360 they had a [ __ ] vote and the goddamn
01:54:49.840 [ __ ] [ __ ] jesus that's a conspiracy
01:54:52.159 theory
01:54:54.800 you think you're [ __ ] tough you're
01:54:55.840 about to get it oh [ __ ] they're killing
01:54:58.080 already born babies stop [ __ ] lying
01:55:00.400 god [ __ ] damn i'm getting pissed now
01:55:02.400 don't get pissed
01:55:16.880 i
01:55:29.920 is so crazy that i always thought i was
01:55:31.520 so tough i can't believe he doesn't have
01:55:32.880 to pee anymore i gotta piss a little bit
01:55:35.360 the point is the point is
01:55:37.599 the point is is that why are we debating
01:55:39.840 whether the earth is flat dude they're
01:55:41.199 keeping they have human animal hybrids
01:55:46.480 yeah that's good stuff that's what i
01:55:48.239 mean i feel like that is the pinnacle of
01:55:50.320 where this medium can take us yeah
01:55:52.560 watching like that's like he was in an
01:55:54.560 extreme state what about when he could
01:55:56.480 go by be comfortable i'll keep
01:56:04.639 like i go and run so i'd listen to this
01:56:07.520 [ __ ] hell man where else are you
01:56:09.199 going to get this content where is that
01:56:11.440 well there's no one would ever agree to
01:56:13.280 it anywhere else that's the thing you'd
01:56:15.119 never get a group of people whose jobs
01:56:16.960 depended upon keeping the show on the
01:56:18.960 air whether they're producers or
01:56:20.480 executives they would never agree to
01:56:22.159 that they'd be like you can't have that
01:56:23.119 crazy [ __ ] on you can't have this on
01:56:24.960 you can't have eddie bravo on all the
01:56:26.480 time he thinks the world is flat stop
01:56:28.880 this
01:56:29.679 because you're traveling between such
01:56:32.400 diverse and unusual ideas and and sort
01:56:35.440 of the thing with alex jones as well is
01:56:37.760 that he's like he
01:56:38.960 demonstrates to a point that there's
01:56:40.480 veracity in what he's saying some things
01:56:43.280 yeah he's right about a lot of things
01:56:45.360 you know when he was talking about
01:56:46.480 animal human hybrids we started pulling
01:56:48.159 up these studies or they actually have
01:56:49.760 done
01:56:50.560 studies where they've tried to create
01:56:52.400 animal human hybrids non-viable
01:56:55.440 animal human embryos they're trying to
01:56:57.840 grow human organs in different animals
01:57:00.480 and there's all sorts of weird
01:57:01.599 scientific [ __ ] that we're doing imagine
01:57:04.400 what they're doing in china behind walls
01:57:06.239 look at this china's latest cloned
01:57:08.480 monkey experiment is an ethical mess
01:57:11.119 they use crispr to add human genes into
01:57:13.199 monkey jeans and there's like five
01:57:14.400 monkeys this happened back in january
01:57:16.320 and i don't know this is a [ __ ]
01:57:18.320 horror movie this is a harmony this is
01:57:20.159 how the horror movie begins why because
01:57:22.080 you think that once if that's what's
01:57:23.599 being revealed the truth is darker yes
01:57:26.719 for sure for sure they're trying to
01:57:28.719 create super soldiers someone is trying
01:57:31.119 to create some super soldier some half
01:57:34.400 champ half human super intelligent
01:57:37.599 murderous thing that's powered by remote
01:57:39.840 control that is not a good objective no
01:57:42.880 i don't see a good outcome for this
01:57:44.560 super intelligent murderous remote
01:57:46.719 control
01:57:48.000 but what if you could send those super
01:57:49.920 intelligent murderous champs to go kill
01:57:52.400 isis now now we've got a reason to start
01:57:54.800 designing get him out there now we need
01:57:56.880 we look we've got a nice contract with
01:57:59.280 this
01:58:00.080 defense contractor and they're gonna
01:58:02.239 that's how we lubricate the passage to
01:58:04.239 the murderous monkeys is isis that's the
01:58:07.199 function of isis in their cultural
01:58:09.360 conversation is to
01:58:11.199 justify the monkey soldiers do you know
01:58:13.360 what one scared me more than anyone that
01:58:15.199 i've ever read i read about this thing
01:58:17.119 that um
01:58:18.560 darpa was putting together it's a a
01:58:20.800 robot called the eater robot eatr robot
01:58:25.199 it's a robot that fuels itself on
01:58:27.440 biological matter
01:58:29.040 so it essentially could eat bodies
01:58:31.440 so you've got a murderous robot that
01:58:33.440 eats people
01:58:35.040 there it's like there's fuel
01:58:37.679 worst kind of things that human beings
01:58:40.639 could achieve it's like people are sat
01:58:42.560 around trying to yeah come up with them
01:58:45.840 well they're you know they they're
01:58:47.599 responsible for a lot of really crazy
01:58:49.760 innovation in terms of like military
01:58:51.520 stuff you know but boston dynamics you
01:58:54.080 know they're the ones that make those
01:58:55.199 crazy robots and they work with darpa
01:58:58.000 and those are the ones that make those
01:58:59.199 robots that you can't kick over right
01:59:01.360 you know i mean that's what you need one
01:59:02.800 of those that eats people and you send
01:59:04.560 them to the battlefield kick it over no
01:59:06.719 that's the first thing we established is
01:59:08.560 you can't kick it over
01:59:10.159 i just think that's that's the big fear
01:59:12.400 is that future warfare will be our
01:59:14.880 robots versus their robots you know
01:59:18.080 if we're starting to bring about the
01:59:20.480 worst aspects or the worst things that a
01:59:22.880 human being can conceive of let's
01:59:24.880 channel them through into reality yeah
01:59:27.520 it does make you feel that the
01:59:28.719 apocalypse is real i thought it was bad
01:59:30.400 enough when in the malaise of my younger
01:59:33.360 days i s like uh for oh wow imagine if
01:59:36.880 there was a cleaning service where the
01:59:39.360 person would come around and clean
01:59:41.119 dressed scantily they do that they do
01:59:43.679 that whatever devious [ __ ] you can dream
01:59:46.159 up someone's trying to turn a buck off
01:59:48.320 it and they've taken it to the extent of
01:59:50.480 the non-kick-over
01:59:52.480 robot flesh eating robots yeah yeah what
01:59:55.360 is this a new one it's a new video today
01:59:57.679 oh god watch this this is so scary this
02:00:01.119 is boston dynamics
02:00:02.800 there's something very eerie about that
02:00:04.560 type of motion you know like the way
02:00:06.560 that the movement of a snake is deeply
02:00:08.639 coded to be unpleasant when you see it
02:00:10.960 the same way you think that movement you
02:00:12.159 think that ain't good but
02:00:13.679 the truck it's towing
02:00:15.360 wow oh my god they're pulling a truck
02:00:17.440 and it's tiny little tootsies those
02:00:19.440 they're that strong they could pull a
02:00:20.880 truck little robots that's a giant ass
02:00:23.040 truck i mean it is also just a husky
02:00:25.280 sled made out of expensive robots and a
02:00:27.679 truck they've
02:00:29.119 spent a lot of time in endeavour to go
02:00:30.800 backwards i i guess kinda but to an
02:00:33.920 issue santa claus they're showing how
02:00:35.840 strong these things are i don't like i
02:00:38.400 don't like their gate joe
02:00:40.560 that's an unpleasant gate yeah you
02:00:42.800 should be on you should be uncomfortable
02:00:44.639 with it yeah that's i'm not easy at ease
02:00:47.040 with that but it's not humorous it's not
02:00:49.679 animal and there's no compassion in it
02:00:51.520 this is it's it's
02:00:53.360 feelingless
02:00:54.639 but that's what you've got to worry
02:00:55.520 about ever see that episode of black
02:00:57.119 mirror or the lady gets chased down by
02:00:58.719 the drones
02:01:00.000 i've not seen that why are they one
02:01:01.360 where they're bees no there's a woman
02:01:03.440 who's being haunted she's being hunted
02:01:05.760 uh by a robot and it's terrifying
02:01:08.560 because of its remorseless lack of
02:01:10.080 humanity and empathy looks just like
02:01:11.920 that looks just like those things those
02:01:14.080 are real
02:01:15.040 charlie brooker he's yeah he's packed
02:01:16.719 into it that man's got good imagination
02:01:18.159 he's amazing he's amazing that show is
02:01:19.920 fantastic but these things look what we
02:01:22.480 have to worry about is once artificial
02:01:24.239 intelligence becomes sentient and you
02:01:26.239 can somehow another attach it to these
02:01:28.320 objects that move
02:01:30.000 and they they run on solar power
02:01:32.320 or they have you know nuclear fuel cells
02:01:34.320 or some crazy [ __ ] that allows them to
02:01:36.320 exist for a long period of time
02:01:38.960 you don't have to worry about them
02:01:40.239 contaminating environments if you plan
02:01:41.920 on killing everybody in the environment
02:01:43.360 oh man and also there's no means of
02:01:45.599 regulation is there because this because
02:01:47.360 this is the apex of human endeavor
02:01:50.400 they're in what what can govern that
02:01:53.040 what can regulate it and like you say
02:01:54.719 there'll be a chinese
02:01:56.239 equivalent
02:01:57.520 for any of this stuff there's nothing
02:01:58.880 that's above it going is this a good
02:02:00.560 idea should we pull back what it is
02:02:03.520 he just pulled up a thing that said
02:02:04.639 they're making that now yeah
02:02:06.400 that one i just showed you they're good
02:02:07.760 100 different models of it are going to
02:02:09.360 be available starting production this
02:02:10.800 summer doesn't say how much that they're
02:02:12.719 going to wow
02:02:14.400 but available for people to buy well it
02:02:16.159 says 100 different models it says
02:02:17.520 produce 100 models that probably means
02:02:19.520 it'll produce 100 of them
02:02:22.080 like 100 different companies are going
02:02:23.520 to want them but i bet it's more than
02:02:25.119 that yeah depending on how much they
02:02:26.719 cost it doesn't say how much it's going
02:02:28.239 to cost they're going to announce that
02:02:29.199 later but they showed
02:02:31.360 like a robot arm coming oh that looks so
02:02:33.199 creepy look at that thing imagine we
02:02:35.040 have one of those things in the room
02:02:36.320 filming we should get one no no that
02:02:39.040 takes over one day we come here it's got
02:02:40.560 red eyes and it's like [ __ ] you [ __ ] you
02:02:42.719 what do you feel like
02:02:44.000 we're the first ones to help it or
02:02:45.280 something trying to befriend it
02:02:47.840 to us like alexa
02:02:49.840 that's how it begins isn't it yeah
02:02:51.599 there's something arachnoid and eerie
02:02:53.440 about that it's almost like you know
02:02:55.760 see if this tunes into the dmt component
02:02:58.639 of what we've been talking about it's
02:03:00.159 almost as if we've already experienced
02:03:02.239 this reality we've already been through
02:03:04.080 the version where those evil insectoid
02:03:06.639 robots take over so when we see it on
02:03:08.719 the screen we think oh no we're doing
02:03:10.480 that thing
02:03:11.599 we're doing that thing where we create
02:03:13.599 those things that bring about our
02:03:15.040 destruction and i believe it's because
02:03:17.520 we've become biased to commerce and a
02:03:21.199 particular type of progress but one
02:03:23.599 narrative has succeeded because we
02:03:25.920 necessarily had to throw off religion
02:03:28.560 but you know at the dawn of the secular
02:03:30.560 age because religion was becoming
02:03:32.560 systems of bias and systems of
02:03:34.560 oppression and what and systems of uh
02:03:37.440 what do i want to say elevating certain
02:03:39.440 types of power and supporting at least
02:03:41.280 let's go hang on a minute this religion
02:03:42.800 a lot of it seems like [ __ ] what
02:03:44.400 we've done is we've abandoned the sacred
02:03:47.040 and i think if you abandon the sacred
02:03:49.199 meaning there is more to life than what
02:03:50.880 we can understand i listened to the
02:03:52.000 brian cox episode and i've spoke to
02:03:53.520 brian cox the british physicist
02:03:55.840 astrophysicist on my show as well and
02:03:57.679 when he talks about like he said that
02:03:59.280 you know we know that there's not some
02:04:00.480 additional component to a human being
02:04:02.159 because we can break down everything
02:04:03.440 that happens when you move an arm you
02:04:05.280 know whatever and i feel like we only
02:04:07.360 have limited instruments we only have
02:04:09.520 limited instruments there's certain
02:04:10.960 frequencies that we simply cannot read
02:04:12.639 what else is going on when people are
02:04:14.159 having these transcendent psychedelic
02:04:15.920 experiences we're accessing elements of
02:04:18.320 consciousness energies and frequencies
02:04:20.000 that we're not
02:04:21.360 able to access while we're in this state
02:04:23.679 and everything we're achieving and
02:04:25.040 everything we're building we're building
02:04:26.639 on this platform and the bias of this
02:04:28.320 platform is towards
02:04:29.679 progress and materialism and i think the
02:04:31.760 result is
02:04:33.280 fleshy in robots and those evil monkey
02:04:35.599 warrior soldiers and we might i want to
02:04:38.080 calm down have a little talk about what
02:04:40.320 it is we're trying to design yeah i
02:04:42.000 don't know if i agree with brian on that
02:04:44.000 particular point that we think we know
02:04:45.920 everything about where consciousness
02:04:48.159 emanates i don't think that's necessary
02:04:50.480 but i like the fact that he thinks that
02:04:51.920 way because he's such a rigid hardliner
02:04:53.920 for science and yeah the guy works at
02:04:55.920 cern i mean he's a brilliant brilliant
02:04:57.840 man so of course he thinks that way i
02:04:59.599 also don't think he's ever had a dmt
02:05:01.599 experience that's right i wonder that
02:05:03.440 yeah some people i think give them a
02:05:05.199 quick dose you know
02:05:07.040 because i as well i respect brian and
02:05:08.880 it's further to my point similar to the
02:05:10.320 hunting argument i can but you know i
02:05:12.320 happen to believe in god but like i when
02:05:14.800 i talk to brian cox i got to the point
02:05:16.800 where i'm saying all right even though i
02:05:18.000 believe in god and you are an uh an
02:05:20.239 atheist although he said i don't call
02:05:21.360 myself an atheist well i felt like we
02:05:23.360 both got to the point where we said
02:05:25.119 compassion kindness and love are the
02:05:27.280 most important thing so in this way who
02:05:29.440 cares so when you say it there when you
02:05:31.119 say you believe in god do you believe in
02:05:32.719 the traditional god of christianity
02:05:35.679 do you believe in god as a concept you
02:05:37.360 have your own definition for it that i
02:05:40.080 believe that that state of
02:05:42.719 oneness and transcendence that you're
02:05:44.800 talking about when you through your dmt
02:05:46.719 experiences that says you know love and
02:05:48.560 kindness and love and awareness
02:05:50.639 i believe that is the most real thing i
02:05:53.119 think that preceded all matter and i
02:05:55.840 think that we that we can interact with
02:05:58.800 it so i don't believe that god in a sort
02:06:00.960 of in just a guy away that the whole
02:06:03.040 world is like an interactive bio
02:06:05.360 biological living breathing goddess i
02:06:08.000 believe that we i believe yes that and
02:06:10.159 that we can commune with it and i and
02:06:12.880 furthermore the relevance of it for me
02:06:14.639 is that it it suggests to me that we
02:06:16.639 should be acting kindly and lovingly and
02:06:19.360 when we're thinking about how do we
02:06:20.719 organize our systems that our awareness
02:06:23.760 of that energy accessible to all of us
02:06:26.639 should be paramount in our understanding
02:06:29.360 of how we organize so like what i think
02:06:32.960 is like that we should look at you know
02:06:34.800 like we've been through as human beings
02:06:36.400 in so many advents that agriculture
02:06:38.800 technology industry thinking that we
02:06:41.360 were the you know the sun went round
02:06:42.960 there thinking that the earth was flat
02:06:44.400 with all due respect to eddie bravo
02:06:47.280 and like you know and we and and before
02:06:49.440 each of these realizations and each of
02:06:51.119 these changes we always think we're at
02:06:52.960 the summit we never know what's going to
02:06:55.199 be the thing that's going to change my
02:06:56.560 suspicion is that what's going to change
02:06:58.960 is that the way we relate to
02:07:00.400 consciousness and the way we see
02:07:01.760 ourselves as individuals that we start
02:07:03.280 to have an understanding that what that
02:07:05.599 that becomes a priority that thing you
02:07:07.119 described of like when i have come back
02:07:08.719 from dmt trips i recognize this is just
02:07:10.960 an illusion and it's not real i think
02:07:12.800 that will start like i believe that we
02:07:15.199 need to prioritize that and progressing
02:07:17.440 along that line what are the
02:07:18.719 implications of this not being the most
02:07:21.440 real frequency there is how do we
02:07:23.599 organize society on that basis how does
02:07:25.679 that affect how we relate to one another
02:07:27.760 what kind of how should we be governing
02:07:29.840 how how does that affect justice that
02:07:31.679 that should be in the mix instead of how
02:07:34.239 many [ __ ] terrifying arachnoid weird
02:07:36.880 gate robot [ __ ] can we
02:07:39.840 you know like that's the way we're going
02:07:41.119 the progressive technological route
02:07:42.639 because it's created medicine because
02:07:44.079 it's saved so many lives because it's
02:07:45.280 given us wonderful technology the spirit
02:07:47.280 of entrepreneurial ship but all of that
02:07:49.280 energy it all gets
02:07:51.040 pushed in one direction yeah it all goes
02:07:53.360 that way and i feel that we need to
02:07:55.360 invite that back the sacred and the
02:07:57.520 divine need to be back in the
02:07:58.719 conversation well there's certainly
02:08:00.320 going to be pros and cons with
02:08:01.840 everything you know there's definitely
02:08:03.440 pros and cons with the creation of
02:08:05.280 technology
02:08:06.639 i think of this i think of human beings
02:08:08.880 as
02:08:10.400 if you go back to single-celled
02:08:11.760 organisms they have very little
02:08:12.960 awareness of their environment and then
02:08:14.880 as it became primitive bugs you know as
02:08:18.159 as things evolved they
02:08:20.639 developed more awareness but even us in
02:08:22.800 comparison to certain animals certain
02:08:24.960 animals have heightened senses of smell
02:08:26.880 and survival instincts but they're also
02:08:28.400 colorblind you know and they they don't
02:08:30.480 see things they see edge detection like
02:08:32.800 that's one of the things about deer
02:08:35.280 they see movement so like if you wear
02:08:37.199 camouflage and you know your your
02:08:39.360 pattern is broken up with a grid
02:08:41.599 and then you stay put they don't see you
02:08:44.239 yeah they just it doesn't meet doesn't
02:08:46.320 register to them they see movement so we
02:08:49.520 have a far more complex
02:08:52.159 system of recognition than they do in
02:08:54.880 terms of like visually the way we see
02:08:56.639 things and i think that whatever
02:09:00.159 skills or whatever
02:09:02.400 senses that we've evolved
02:09:04.480 i don't think that's it i don't think
02:09:06.320 that we've reached the pinnacle of it
02:09:08.239 and i think that as
02:09:10.320 beings become more and more evolved
02:09:12.639 they'll probably gain more and more
02:09:14.000 senses and that could be
02:09:16.159 directly related to technology
02:09:19.679 it's totally possible that what's going
02:09:21.840 on with technologies that we're also
02:09:23.840 developing through external means a way
02:09:27.119 for us to see the world a way for us to
02:09:29.599 view like what they've done with the
02:09:30.719 large hadron colliders like the best
02:09:32.320 example of it right what they do with
02:09:33.760 the hubble space telescope and other
02:09:36.000 telescopes you're using technology to
02:09:38.480 gain awareness and to see more things
02:09:40.719 and that this is the good side of
02:09:43.040 technologies that it's
02:09:45.040 allowing us to have a far greater
02:09:47.440 understanding of all the variables that
02:09:49.760 surround us that we might not be able to
02:09:51.520 detect with our senses yes
02:09:53.440 that this is a part of who we are and
02:09:55.199 then i think when you're talking about
02:09:57.280 things like psychedelic experiences
02:09:58.719 that's probably another realm of
02:10:00.480 understanding that we haven't really
02:10:01.760 achieved yet because we're we're still
02:10:03.920 evolving as a as a species as a thing
02:10:07.920 what i think is interesting is that the
02:10:09.440 continual bias along that technological
02:10:12.719 path is towards profit you know when we
02:10:15.280 see those
02:10:16.800 machines the end point is always how do
02:10:19.199 we make how do we maximize profit there
02:10:21.760 is no like the influence of how do we do
02:10:24.719 what's right that's like a sort of a a
02:10:27.599 person like a sort of a general ethical
02:10:31.119 uh what i want to say sort of code is
02:10:33.360 not being introduced there is no
02:10:35.040 regulation like you know like ultimately
02:10:37.760 you know ultimately people will create
02:10:39.760 the warrior monkeys or the most
02:10:42.239 profitable machines people because the
02:10:44.480 the counter argument isn't being made no
02:10:47.360 one is like what i'm saying no one's
02:10:49.040 making it there's just there's no union
02:10:51.199 of uh
02:10:52.400 you know there's no sort of clear
02:10:54.159 opinion of hang on a minute where could
02:10:56.480 we be going no there is no body or
02:10:59.520 ideology that's able to oppose the
02:11:02.000 relentless march of capitalism i'm not
02:11:04.159 sort of like a flat out or capitalism is
02:11:05.760 bad here i am promoting a book using an
02:11:08.400 iphone or you know i mean i'm we're all
02:11:10.639 swimming in it right but what i'm saying
02:11:12.639 is that
02:11:14.079 if we acknowledge there are transcendent
02:11:16.320 realms there there is information date
02:11:18.719 and data that exists beyond what we're
02:11:20.480 able to receive with our senses how are
02:11:22.400 we going to incorporate that in the way
02:11:24.239 we organize because otherwise the sort
02:11:26.000 of the magnetism the pull the g-force of
02:11:28.560 what's most profitable what's going to
02:11:30.239 continue to suit the uh
02:11:32.960 requirements of the powerful that will
02:11:35.119 always the bias will always fall in that
02:11:37.199 direction and it seems like where that's
02:11:38.880 heading is certain kinds of ecological
02:11:40.800 disaster certain kinds of economic
02:11:42.480 inequality certain kinds of conflict you
02:11:44.719 know and like when one of the simple uh
02:11:48.000 experiments that i apply is you know if
02:11:50.079 we you know if people say oh what's
02:11:51.520 wrong with the world world so [ __ ] all
02:11:52.960 this polarity i sometimes think well who
02:11:54.639 is benefiting from how it is now are
02:11:56.800 there is anyone benefiting are there any
02:11:58.719 groups institutions or individuals for
02:12:00.800 whom this current state is beneficial
02:12:03.599 and if the answer to that question is
02:12:04.960 yes then look at who those institutions
02:12:08.000 are and they are most likely to a degree
02:12:10.960 involved in establishing and maintaining
02:12:13.280 these systems and there are you know
02:12:15.920 institutions and individuals and
02:12:17.599 organizations that this works just fine
02:12:20.560 for but are they just capitalizing on it
02:12:22.800 or are they organizing it and is a
02:12:24.400 normal part of the way human beings
02:12:26.719 operate with this constant desire for
02:12:29.280 innovation constant desire for
02:12:31.199 improvement we always want to push
02:12:32.800 further no no one's comfortable where
02:12:34.480 they are they will always want to be in
02:12:35.760 a better place and this is almost like
02:12:37.760 it's built into capitalism right i agree
02:12:40.960 that this materialism which is built
02:12:42.560 into capitalism also is what fuels
02:12:44.560 innovation because you want the newest
02:12:46.560 iphone so they have to design it and
02:12:48.079 build it and make it and when new things
02:12:50.320 come out like this new robot that
02:12:51.840 apparently you're going to 100 models
02:12:54.000 whatever that means
02:12:55.599 what that is is this is
02:12:57.360 they're going to sell it so there's like
02:12:59.360 it's fueling innovation someone else
02:13:01.440 will come along and compete with boston
02:13:02.880 dynamics and then there will be
02:13:04.560 there would be innovation wars if these
02:13:06.239 innovation wars weren't
02:13:08.000 in place right now our phones would look
02:13:10.159 nothing like the iphone x it just
02:13:12.079 wouldn't it wouldn't look like the sx it
02:13:13.760 would look like
02:13:14.880 who knows what it would look like but
02:13:16.159 there would be no
02:13:17.440 no incentive for them to compete against
02:13:20.159 all these samsung devices and huawei
02:13:22.400 devices and all that stuff is fueling
02:13:24.639 this innovation but it's all being
02:13:25.840 fueled by capitalism you're quite right
02:13:27.599 that that the innovation is one of the
02:13:30.239 benefits of the maintaining this system
02:13:33.599 but it seems to me that we are excluding
02:13:36.320 other factors like that that recur
02:13:39.440 throughout human cultures we all have an
02:13:41.599 idea of fairness
02:13:43.040 of justice and yeah i don't want some
02:13:45.280 clunky weird sort of eastern block phone
02:13:48.320 made out of grey plastic you know only
02:13:50.960 one button on it like but like
02:13:53.760 we have to i suppose examine as a
02:13:56.239 society and as individuals what is
02:13:59.440 important to us now where i think you
02:14:01.040 know we've talked touched several times
02:14:03.119 upon you know the fact that as an
02:14:04.719 individual you're more likely to bias
02:14:06.400 yourself towards negative information
02:14:08.480 online you know like we do have a degree
02:14:11.040 of individual power and individual
02:14:13.079 responsibility and i feel like if enough
02:14:15.360 people awaken to the possibility of
02:14:17.760 different narratives that the the
02:14:19.679 capitalist idea of innovation and
02:14:21.760 success and progress that all of these
02:14:24.480 words can be examined what do you mean
02:14:26.400 progress that assumes a teleology a
02:14:28.719 purpose a destination if all time is
02:14:31.360 happening at once if space is infinite
02:14:34.000 like you know that bit of yours of like
02:14:35.920 you know to try and fathom for a moment
02:14:38.159 the limitlessness that we're existing
02:14:39.920 within then all these things are
02:14:41.760 constructs this is a construct and it is
02:14:44.159 good to have technology but it's
02:14:46.159 possible to like at points times of
02:14:48.719 crisis such as what it feels like we're
02:14:51.440 at now and although that people have
02:14:52.560 said well we always feel that every
02:14:54.000 generation thinks that they're the one
02:14:55.920 because they know their own impending
02:14:57.760 death is coming and they narrativize
02:14:59.280 that into something social and global
02:15:01.280 well regardless there's got to be a time
02:15:03.440 where we start to introduce different
02:15:04.960 ideas into our systems it seems like
02:15:06.800 there's room for that now because we do
02:15:08.960 live in a tow a truly global culture
02:15:11.599 that there is the possibility for
02:15:13.280 monoliths to introduce new innovation
02:15:15.679 and there is nothing that can oppose it
02:15:17.360 or regulate it we're starting to see
02:15:19.199 this kind of breakdown so i'm interested
02:15:21.760 in
02:15:22.800 how we can individually prepare
02:15:24.719 ourselves to organize society
02:15:27.199 differently to be able to overcome
02:15:29.840 pretty superficial differences like oh
02:15:31.840 you go honey and i don't go hunting we i
02:15:34.079 think we gives a [ __ ] let's start
02:15:35.920 talking about how we can organize the
02:15:37.440 size where people who go on and don't go
02:15:39.199 hunting can live peacefully in different
02:15:41.679 ways not entirely governed by a small
02:15:44.639 cabal you know and i'm sure power is
02:15:47.360 more complex than that that seem to be
02:15:49.199 hugely biasing the direction of this
02:15:51.360 so-called progress i think you answered
02:15:53.679 your own previous questions when you're
02:15:55.199 talking about whether or not you can be
02:15:56.719 spiritual and funny and like what are
02:15:58.400 you doing can you carve that path out
02:16:00.079 for yourself that what you're doing
02:16:02.159 there by explaining that would influence
02:16:04.880 people would give people a perspective
02:16:07.199 that allows them to say yeah like why
02:16:08.719 are we doing this and what is the
02:16:10.079 purpose of this and if enough people
02:16:12.239 hear those words and have that
02:16:13.760 perspective introduced to them it'll
02:16:16.000 change the way they interact with the
02:16:17.840 world and that changes the world it
02:16:19.679 really does and
02:16:21.199 that's one of the more powerful things
02:16:23.040 about discussions when someone like you
02:16:25.440 says something like that and it
02:16:26.560 resonates with people and they start
02:16:27.760 thinking like why am i living like this
02:16:29.440 like what if i only have if i really do
02:16:32.000 only have 50 years to live
02:16:34.000 why am i living these 50 years in some
02:16:36.398 really unproductive [ __ ] way that's
02:16:38.638 not satisfying at all because i just
02:16:40.638 want a bigger house like what is it do i
02:16:42.558 want a faster car do i want to expensive
02:16:46.398 piece of jewelry like what is what is
02:16:48.478 the purpose of this path that i'm on now
02:16:50.879 versus a path that i could be on and
02:16:53.840 what is the real conflict that we all
02:16:56.959 experience between each other is it
02:16:59.200 how much of it is due to a lack of
02:17:00.879 communication how much of it is due to a
02:17:02.799 lack of real listening and understanding
02:17:04.879 one of the things i've said about like
02:17:06.160 comments and podcasts and stuff like
02:17:07.679 that i think one of the reasons why a
02:17:09.120 lot of people get mad and i've tried to
02:17:10.718 think this through like why some people
02:17:13.280 some of the response is so negative the
02:17:14.879 things that don't that seem innocuous on
02:17:16.558 the outside i think it's because it's
02:17:18.799 frustrating when you don't have a say
02:17:21.120 yeah like if two people see you and i
02:17:22.718 are talking about something there's
02:17:23.760 probably some guy right now going well
02:17:25.840 just [ __ ] stop with all your
02:17:28.478 spiritual [ __ ] here's what you do
02:17:30.638 you wake up when your [ __ ] alarm
02:17:32.318 clock goes off you never hit snooze you
02:17:34.718 get out the door you put your hours in
02:17:37.040 eventually you get better you take care
02:17:38.718 of your family you act like a [ __ ]
02:17:40.478 man and there's probably people like
02:17:42.080 that that are they're upset they feel
02:17:43.920 like we're pontificating too much and
02:17:45.359 this is all just you know
02:17:47.280 just
02:17:48.080 mental masturbation you're right in some
02:17:49.840 ways it is but that's part of how you
02:17:51.439 dissolve these things and think these
02:17:53.040 things through i believe they deserve
02:17:54.638 their say as well and that's one of the
02:17:56.638 things that you know of being a person
02:17:57.920 that goes to 12-step support groups is
02:18:00.558 you recognize that everyone's individual
02:18:02.558 experience
02:18:03.599 is valuable yes but it's not like that
02:18:06.000 and i've got over the idea that you know
02:18:08.558 that there's some external thing can be
02:18:10.160 imposed and like you know whilst there
02:18:12.718 are like many people that are you know
02:18:15.040 we could say
02:18:16.558 not using their 50 years to maximum
02:18:18.318 effect because they are you know
02:18:20.080 pursuing odd material goals there are
02:18:22.959 you know many many more people that are
02:18:25.200 have never been introduced to the idea
02:18:26.879 of freedom because from the moment
02:18:28.080 they're born they're economically
02:18:29.920 tyrannized and told that you're only if
02:18:32.160 you are not economically valuable to
02:18:33.760 this system you are not valuable at all
02:18:36.000 and that isn't that's only an idea but
02:18:38.398 you know if you don't you know if you
02:18:39.519 can't become a lawyer or you know a
02:18:41.760 comedian or whatever [ __ ] you well so
02:18:44.080 many of us are trapped in the
02:18:45.679 expectations and values of our parents
02:18:47.760 too that's a real problem with people
02:18:49.760 don't let their children become an
02:18:52.000 individual you know they force their
02:18:54.000 children to follow their own rigid
02:18:56.080 ideology and they shame them when they
02:18:57.920 don't i agree with that but do you not
02:19:00.318 imagine that a fair degree of that stuff
02:19:02.478 is unconscious
02:19:05.200 probably unconsciously imposing things
02:19:07.679 on our kids 100 but not with guilt and i
02:19:10.959 mean if your kid comes to you and say
02:19:12.398 daddy no i know you wanted me to be a
02:19:13.920 doctor but [ __ ] it i want to play bongos
02:19:16.240 i just want to be the best bongo player
02:19:17.679 of all time i bet you'd probably be like
02:19:19.679 hey
02:19:20.398 learn the [ __ ] bongos give me a hug
02:19:22.558 yeah go get those bongos get out there
02:19:24.558 yeah become the best damn goer you can
02:19:27.040 there are even mediocre sure but there
02:19:29.359 are fathers out there be like the [ __ ]
02:19:31.679 you are you're going to be a goddamn
02:19:33.200 doctor stop being a [ __ ] and you're
02:19:35.200 going to go back to medical school and
02:19:36.638 you're going to pick up your studies
02:19:37.679 we're going to get you a tutor and
02:19:39.120 you're going to perform because we're a
02:19:40.398 wilson you're a wilson and our this
02:19:42.478 wilson family has been physicians since
02:19:44.799 18 20. your grandfather i'm immoral
02:19:49.120 he made people bite down on a leather
02:19:50.640 strap before amnesia and he sawed off
02:19:52.560 legs and he kept those people alive
02:19:54.800 you want to play bongos you little [ __ ]
02:19:57.280 yeah yeah people get mad but my bias is
02:20:00.000 towards my kid like uh like sort of
02:20:02.880 like when we was back in england like i
02:20:04.960 was aware of like grandparents or
02:20:06.319 whatever reacting to spiders and stuff
02:20:08.800 going oh spiders are scary don't [ __ ]
02:20:11.439 teach them that spiders are scary i
02:20:13.680 don't want her to think of things as
02:20:15.600 scary tell her like these spiders are
02:20:17.280 cool they're all right there's something
02:20:18.560 you know like so yeah and you're aware
02:20:20.960 of familial influence like that they
02:20:22.800 wanted the hair to be a certain way they
02:20:24.479 wanted to wear certain things they
02:20:25.520 wanted to
02:20:26.479 like you know part of the veganism is
02:20:28.240 like if you make these kids vegan at
02:20:30.240 least now i know wherever they go
02:20:31.840 there's going to be so many restrictions
02:20:33.200 on their food i've not made the kids
02:20:34.319 vegan they're good
02:20:36.080 it's up to them yeah thank you where's
02:20:37.520 my gold star where's my ticket parade
02:20:40.319 but like uh so but like you know i but i
02:20:43.280 don't know
02:20:44.399 what you know we don't know our own
02:20:46.319 biases we don't know what where we've
02:20:48.640 been institutionalized you know
02:20:51.200 because how you know the very nature of
02:20:52.640 the unconscious is we are not aware of
02:20:54.399 it you know so i suppose in a sense a
02:20:56.720 continued open-mindedness and a
02:20:58.399 willingness to change must be part of
02:21:00.479 any dialogue to go into these situations
02:21:03.280 you know i might not actually know what
02:21:05.280 that's why i'm not when i was 20 if
02:21:07.600 you'd have said about the hunt in i'd be
02:21:09.680 like oh no man like now i'm like yeah
02:21:12.240 jesus there's so many ways of seeing the
02:21:13.840 world there's so many ways of looking at
02:21:15.520 what's natural and what's correct i'm
02:21:17.520 you know what do i know i think with
02:21:18.720 hunting hunting is like many things and
02:21:20.880 that there's no real clean answer
02:21:23.439 there's no yes or no good or bad because
02:21:26.479 you could think there is but then you
02:21:28.479 find circumstances like wild pigs or
02:21:31.600 invasive species like i go hunting on a
02:21:34.399 place called lanai it's one of the small
02:21:35.920 islands of hawaii
02:21:37.520 there's
02:21:38.479 somewhere in the neighborhood of 3 000
02:21:42.160 people
02:21:43.120 and 20 000 deer it is so overpopulated
02:21:47.600 with deer
02:21:48.640 and they have to kill them they kill
02:21:49.760 them every day they hire snipers they
02:21:51.520 hire people to kill them people are
02:21:52.640 slamming in with their cars i mean
02:21:54.240 they're [ __ ] everywhere and they're
02:21:56.160 access deer they're not even from there
02:21:58.479 they're from uh someone brought them
02:22:00.399 over from india to give to king
02:22:02.080 kamehameha in like the 1800s they're
02:22:04.960 animals actually that evolved to get
02:22:06.319 away from tigers so there's this
02:22:08.399 insanely fast beautiful deer that are
02:22:11.200 everywhere they're forced to kill well
02:22:13.200 the good news is the people that are
02:22:15.359 low-income people of the island always
02:22:17.040 have meat there's there's meat
02:22:18.319 everywhere everyone can hunt it's really
02:22:20.080 easy to find them you can you could find
02:22:21.840 them and if you you know if you want you
02:22:23.680 can go kill them yeah i've got no moral
02:22:26.080 judgment about that you know if there's
02:22:27.680 rats in my house well i'm not going to
02:22:29.120 put down poison i'm going to go oh but
02:22:30.880 that's the thing right right
02:22:32.960 you should probably feel bad about
02:22:35.200 killing a rat right as a vegan i do feel
02:22:37.439 bad i feel bad i feel bad about
02:22:39.040 everything i'm hungry what about me yeah
02:22:41.840 i i wouldn't i wouldn't swat a mosquito
02:22:44.880 even
02:22:45.840 even the dalai lama
02:22:47.439 even the dalai lama lo i see him he went
02:22:50.160 uh like the first time a gentle brush
02:22:52.319 the second time a harder one third time
02:22:53.840 smack the dalai lamp like you know the
02:22:55.760 dalai lama gives them free chances
02:22:59.600 then you're out you might be
02:23:00.960 reincarnated or something better can i
02:23:02.399 go the please yeah sure go ahead man
02:23:05.439 it's almost three o'clock already
02:23:06.800 believe it or not quite well oh god like
02:23:09.040 when standing up has made me realize the
02:23:10.720 pressure my bladder was under
02:23:15.200 he's such a character isn't he he's got
02:23:17.439 these incredibly long rants you know but
02:23:20.640 he's so um self-aware and introspective
02:23:23.760 he's like always analyzing himself
02:23:25.600 trying to find if he's doing right
02:23:28.479 i get a kick of these celebrity dudes
02:23:30.080 doing jiu jitsu too i think it's
02:23:32.080 hilarious it's awesome
02:23:34.080 it's cool it's cool to hear him talk
02:23:36.080 about it you could tell you know the
02:23:38.000 struggles with it i just saw someone
02:23:39.840 else say that just started it and i
02:23:41.280 can't remember who it was someone famous
02:23:43.439 yeah it might not be relevant at all but
02:23:44.960 i'm trying to i think demi lovato is
02:23:47.359 like a purple belt or some [ __ ]
02:23:49.520 she's been into it for a long time uh
02:23:51.840 russell who you know i've trained with
02:23:54.080 it russell's a legit blue belt
02:23:56.160 i rolled with russell and i was like wow
02:23:58.720 russell really knows jiu jitsu he's
02:24:00.640 actually doing the right stuff here it's
02:24:02.800 hard
02:24:04.240 it's hard for someone to go
02:24:06.240 from a place of where a guy like russell
02:24:09.280 brand is
02:24:11.680 handsome
02:24:13.280 beautiful famous man
02:24:15.600 who
02:24:16.960 has got some strange plumber sitting on
02:24:19.920 his face yanking on his arm his
02:24:22.240 description of it is awesome
02:24:24.399 yeah filled with bow feces and his
02:24:27.040 bowels and yeah
02:24:29.600 that veganism stuff's for the birds
02:24:31.280 though sorry vegan people
02:24:33.600 to eat eggs if you don't want to kill
02:24:35.359 any animals please just find find a good
02:24:37.920 farm that has pasture-raised eggs and
02:24:40.080 see how much better you feel or eat
02:24:43.120 animals that are [ __ ] you should
02:24:44.960 find animals that are [ __ ] in the
02:24:46.640 woods only eat the [ __ ]
02:24:49.520 somebody sent me this horrible video
02:24:51.040 that i've seen many times before of a
02:24:53.520 bear
02:24:54.640 killing a deer in a backyard and a deer
02:24:56.640 screaming the bears tearing apart i'm
02:24:58.560 sure you've seen that before right
02:25:00.640 and uh he sent it to me and he goes okay
02:25:03.200 now i get it
02:25:05.040 like
02:25:05.840 i didn't think
02:25:07.280 i thought like if a bear got a deer that
02:25:10.399 it would be just oh hey this is just how
02:25:12.960 nature works like no this is a horrific
02:25:15.520 violent act of this animal tearing this
02:25:18.319 other animal apart now
02:25:20.399 would you prefer that than a hunter
02:25:22.880 because 99 times out of 100 when a
02:25:25.920 hunter
02:25:26.960 kills an animal it's way quicker that's
02:25:28.960 the video it's horrible
02:25:31.840 it's a horrible video this animal i
02:25:34.240 think it's actually a black bear i think
02:25:36.399 it's either a grizzly or a color phase
02:25:39.120 black bear but it takes a long time too
02:25:41.840 if you if you haven't seen the video
02:25:44.000 it's a long one and the animal makes
02:25:46.319 some horrible noises we're talking about
02:25:48.560 uh russell returns we're talking about a
02:25:51.120 video
02:25:52.479 that i've seen before about this bear
02:25:54.319 that kills this deer and this guy's yard
02:25:56.080 the guy films in the deer is making
02:25:57.600 these horrible noises
02:25:59.600 and uh this guy sent sent it to me and
02:26:01.920 he goes now i get it because i get what
02:26:04.160 the wild is actually all about because
02:26:06.000 you don't really see it that much you
02:26:07.359 don't really it's very rare that you
02:26:08.800 actually see an animal kill an animal so
02:26:10.880 we have these romantic disney find ideas
02:26:14.000 of what the food chain looks like out
02:26:15.600 there yeah nature's brutal i mean i
02:26:17.680 don't try and impose
02:26:19.200 on my dog the kind of conditions that i
02:26:21.840 would hold myself to you should have an
02:26:24.319 organic garden if you really want to do
02:26:26.080 it right because if you're getting into
02:26:27.600 large-scale agriculture you're buying
02:26:29.359 food from people that grow it they're
02:26:31.439 running over [ __ ] rabbits and mice
02:26:33.920 and killing things with pesticides and
02:26:36.080 there's no there's no removing yourself
02:26:38.080 from death but just by eating vegetables
02:26:40.479 it's just you don't they have to re also
02:26:43.040 they have to like when with large-scale
02:26:45.359 agriculture their that ground all those
02:26:48.399 animals get displaced yeah you know it
02:26:50.800 [ __ ] the whole ecosystem up whatever
02:26:52.960 area they're planting on and then when
02:26:54.479 they roll over it with those gigantic
02:26:56.399 combines and pull up that grain they're
02:26:58.720 chewing up everything that's why
02:27:00.160 vultures always circle where combines
02:27:02.560 are as soon as they have fresh cut the
02:27:04.160 vultures start showing up because they
02:27:05.520 know there's going to be something that
02:27:06.560 got jacked see once you know that that
02:27:09.760 monoculture
02:27:11.439 is unhealthy the only resistance to
02:27:15.200 altering it to having like permaculture
02:27:17.520 and
02:27:18.240 healthier better agricultural models is
02:27:21.920 commerce and profit that's not okay no
02:27:24.160 no no your communes which you could have
02:27:26.319 as community gardens yes yes you could
02:27:28.160 but the only re but like if you start if
02:27:29.840 we start saying hey why don't we not
02:27:31.439 have monoculture anymore because it's uh
02:27:33.840 unfair and it's unreasonable they go we
02:27:35.600 can't because uh it's profitable to have
02:27:38.399 it and people won't be able to afford
02:27:39.680 food but all of that is like a you know
02:27:41.439 a an interrelated system that's sort of
02:27:44.160 gridlocked into protecting itself yeah
02:27:46.560 you know like there's a
02:27:47.840 spiritual maxim wisdom is acting on
02:27:50.560 knowledge and that is not the world we
02:27:52.319 live in we know things and then we just
02:27:54.160 ignore it you know like as individuals
02:27:57.120 or as or as you know corporations and as
02:28:00.479 groups and like what i feel like i'm
02:28:02.720 trying to do as an individual is holding
02:28:04.479 myself to that standard like i know
02:28:06.080 that's not good for me to do that
02:28:07.280 anymore i'm not going to do that i'm
02:28:08.960 going to like i'm going to watch myself
02:28:10.800 and i'm going to watch that behavior and
02:28:12.479 i'm going to try and improve you know
02:28:14.240 like i don't want to go like when my
02:28:16.240 first impulse and heading down to the
02:28:18.080 hibero jiu jitsu places i feel nervous i
02:28:21.040 don't feel confident doing it i don't
02:28:22.800 want to go or whether it's like giving
02:28:24.880 up me or whatever but i'm doing these
02:28:26.560 things in a sense i think these are the
02:28:28.160 kind of improvements i can make now like
02:28:31.200 when you we almost don't expect that of
02:28:33.280 politics anymore you don't expect a sort
02:28:35.280 of a political figure to say well listen
02:28:38.000 monoculture's having a terrible impact
02:28:39.439 they'll make some gestural thing
02:28:40.880 wouldn't they they go look we're going
02:28:41.920 to try and control facebook and google a
02:28:44.240 little bit we're going to try and reduce
02:28:46.640 emissions this amount now we'll go
02:28:48.560 listen we know that's wrong we're not
02:28:49.840 going to do that anymore because
02:28:51.680 there's too many powerful interests
02:28:53.040 that's why i was susceptible to the
02:28:54.160 vegan documentary you know of course
02:28:55.920 there's the ethical reasons in my
02:28:57.200 opinion for becoming
02:28:58.880 vegan but because it's like the reason
02:29:00.960 that these kind of foods are promoted is
02:29:03.040 because these powerful groups lobby
02:29:05.840 government and lobby the the group the
02:29:08.720 organizations that set the standards
02:29:10.240 until they shut up and comply well you
02:29:13.359 could sort of say that about vegetable
02:29:15.120 based foods too i mean do you think
02:29:17.359 they're powerful vegan lobbyists
02:29:19.359 no no
02:29:20.720 no vegetables just corn just growing
02:29:23.680 corn definitely
02:29:25.040 i mean that's what i agree with you
02:29:26.240 first that's the same that is the same
02:29:28.479 you know like you're saying that the
02:29:29.520 reason that is continuing is because
02:29:31.120 it's profitable and but these ideas
02:29:33.040 aren't going to get explored because
02:29:34.479 we're on one path one teleological
02:29:36.880 journey like that's sometimes what i
02:29:38.800 feel like when people talk about the
02:29:40.560 threats of different cultural influence
02:29:43.040 eg
02:29:43.920 islam for example right but i feel like
02:29:46.240 well we already live in a kind of
02:29:48.080 fundamentalism that's invisible to us
02:29:50.319 because it's all we know we'd live in a
02:29:52.560 culture that if something isn't
02:29:53.760 profitable it will not survive and i
02:29:55.680 don't think that's how human beings are
02:29:57.280 set up to exist i have this rather
02:29:59.600 lovely anecdote about like i was coming
02:30:01.680 back from a gig and there was a woman
02:30:03.920 like her car broke down the side of the
02:30:05.280 road i had a driver forgive me forgive
02:30:07.040 me i'm not poor anymore forgive me i had
02:30:09.359 a driver and we see this woman she's
02:30:10.800 about the car outside the road the cars
02:30:12.240 broke down and different like it's a
02:30:14.240 night time and like a few different
02:30:16.080 people stop and help her the first guy
02:30:17.920 is like this is in england it's like a
02:30:19.280 polish immigrant guy comes and helps you
02:30:21.760 know my drivers muslim geezer he's
02:30:24.319 helping i'm trying to help pretty
02:30:26.560 inefficient may say because you know
02:30:28.080 like if you're a famous person when you
02:30:29.760 go into a situation there's sometimes
02:30:31.760 you don't want to be recognized there's
02:30:33.120 other times it's kind of good to be
02:30:34.399 recognized when you're not recognised at
02:30:36.160 all i always think oh i'm not being all
02:30:38.479 recognized in this situation no one
02:30:40.160 recognized me in that time so i was just
02:30:41.920 a weird geezer at the side of the road
02:30:44.240 trying to help someone who had a minor
02:30:45.680 accident without any relevant skills
02:30:48.800 then someone stopped with relevant
02:30:50.399 skills he was like a paramedic he took
02:30:52.399 control of the situation he was ordering
02:30:53.760 people around you stand here you do this
02:30:55.439 go and get that go and get my head torch
02:30:57.359 he said at one point he had a [ __ ]
02:30:58.880 head torch this guy's serious and like
02:31:00.640 he was like he brilliantly resolved the
02:31:02.399 situation um what are you doing with the
02:31:04.880 head do you mean like a light he had a
02:31:07.040 head torch
02:31:08.960 okay not a torch like a light yeah
02:31:11.439 is he burning
02:31:24.160 like what's that y doing in there
02:31:27.280 that's that's
02:31:27.760 queen
02:31:28.640 why does color have a u in it
02:31:31.280 you need that u
02:31:32.960 to round off the second syllable of
02:31:35.200 color you savage yank brutes with your
02:31:38.479 color color no it's a diphthong color
02:31:42.240 color we can't even say snooker
02:31:45.280 we say snucker
02:31:46.800 we can't even pronounce a sport that we
02:31:48.720 don't know
02:31:50.240 yeah i mean it's a is we burn him
02:31:52.960 catastrophe the way how do we burn him
02:32:00.800 listen this guy had what you would
02:32:02.399 evidently call a headlight but even that
02:32:04.560 doesn't sound right it was a lamp a
02:32:06.240 headlamp yeah like that's an odd thing
02:32:08.160 to happen
02:32:09.520 no no i have one well you've got a
02:32:11.040 headlamp in your car yes what are you
02:32:13.120 anticipating if you get stuck somewhere
02:32:14.880 man if anything happens you should have
02:32:16.800 a headlamp this is the kind of person
02:32:18.479 that you want pulling over well listen
02:32:20.000 when you go hunting one of the things
02:32:21.439 that happens is you're in the woods and
02:32:23.200 when it happens when the sun goes down
02:32:24.960 you can't see where the [ __ ] you're
02:32:26.160 going you have to have a headlamp how
02:32:28.080 every hunter has a headlamp very far i
02:32:30.720 have a really good one
02:32:32.479 yeah a really good one so you're
02:32:34.160 lighting stuff up isn't that going to
02:32:36.399 alert the well you're you don't hunt at
02:32:38.240 night right you know it's illegal once
02:32:40.399 the sun goes down there's no hunting you
02:32:42.319 have to be able to see what you're
02:32:43.120 shooting at otherwise you shoot a person
02:32:45.040 so you have these [ __ ] sorts of rules
02:32:46.880 lights on your head are just to help you
02:32:48.240 navigate through the woods and to spot
02:32:50.000 predators because of course if you're
02:32:51.439 vulnerable
02:32:52.640 you know and you see giant eyes ahead
02:32:55.280 that are nine feet off the ground you're
02:32:56.720 like oh [ __ ] it's a bear it's a two-way
02:32:59.439 street yeah hunt in it's like oh hold on
02:33:01.920 the hunt has become
02:33:03.280 yeah that happens i've had experiences
02:33:05.760 where i've ran into predators in the
02:33:07.200 wild particularly uh one time in canada
02:33:09.760 i ran into a grizzly bear and uh looking
02:33:12.080 in the eyes it wasn't even a big one it
02:33:13.520 was like a six foot bear wasn't huge but
02:33:15.840 it looks right through you it looks
02:33:17.600 right through you inside when you run
02:33:19.040 into an animal that's killing [ __ ] every
02:33:20.960 day and it looks at you oh yeah there's
02:33:22.880 like a demonic look in its eyes i've me
02:33:25.840 i've seen black bears before you don't
02:33:27.760 see that look a grizzly bear which is
02:33:30.560 you know more predatory they have a
02:33:32.240 crazy look in their eyes it's really
02:33:34.080 interesting i made eye contact with a
02:33:36.479 couple of predators a shark once in a
02:33:39.280 shark cage on like when i was doing that
02:33:41.680 film sarah marshall that i've done years
02:33:42.960 ago or winning a shark cage and right
02:33:46.000 and they lower you down and you see a
02:33:47.520 shake a shark come towards you it's like
02:33:49.120 it's swimming through time it's like
02:33:50.880 it's come from another area it looks at
02:33:52.319 you like you think whoa [ __ ] you know
02:33:54.720 and like and i was terrified in that
02:33:56.319 cage and like like ed norton was there
02:33:58.720 and with the olsen they were on that
02:34:00.319 island as well they were mates with
02:34:01.680 people that were in the movie they got
02:34:03.200 in the water outside of the cage other
02:34:05.439 other [ __ ] man that's insane isn't it
02:34:07.520 this shark was little and apparently
02:34:08.960 it's not kind of sharp they eat you but
02:34:10.240 even the eye contacts and it's [ __ ]
02:34:12.080 teeth i don't even look at it and then
02:34:14.160 another thing i looked at once i was in
02:34:15.600 a tiger sanctuary in
02:34:17.920 india and i like uh i didn't like the
02:34:20.479 vehicle i was in oh yeah this is a
02:34:22.960 i should have maybe stuck with that
02:34:24.640 actually this ain't comfortable there's
02:34:26.880 a better jeep over there so i got out of
02:34:28.880 it to transition and my mate goes you
02:34:31.200 want to get in the car now mate there's
02:34:32.640 a [ __ ] tiger over there and there was
02:34:34.319 a tiger like only 10 foot away
02:34:38.319 maybe i'm exaggerating hold on a 20 foot
02:34:40.240 maximum like if it was near and the way
02:34:42.399 that that thing look i mean because it's
02:34:43.840 so beautiful as well the intensity of
02:34:46.720 being looked at by that [ __ ] creature
02:34:49.359 that was some powerful [ __ ] you don't
02:34:50.960 want eye contact without i don't want to
02:34:52.880 look at something that's got like that
02:34:54.560 you can't negotiate with you can't i
02:34:56.560 feel like look at me even with a jiu
02:34:57.920 jitsu like i've got that little moment
02:34:59.520 where i go right hey come on they sell
02:35:01.120 russ yeah with a tiger negotiating he
02:35:03.520 doesn't care about your mortgage yeah
02:35:05.520 neither does that grizzly bear doesn't
02:35:07.040 care they look through buckets yeah they
02:35:09.359 don't care
02:35:10.479 it's just but that's all it's doing all
02:35:12.240 day long it's a killing thing it's
02:35:13.680 unbelievable because that's as true as
02:35:15.680 everything we reflect on it just to ask
02:35:18.160 who gives a [ __ ] about your theories
02:35:19.840 don't know what that is so their idea of
02:35:22.240 what the wild is is really based on two
02:35:25.120 things one's their their actual love of
02:35:27.280 animals they know right it's like dogs
02:35:29.920 and cats so the animals that we know we
02:35:32.800 we have this connection with them so we
02:35:34.560 think that these are animals they're
02:35:36.800 science projects man those are not
02:35:38.960 animals real animals don't give a [ __ ]
02:35:41.439 about you
02:35:42.479 they they're in either indifferent to
02:35:44.640 you or they're scared of you or they
02:35:46.399 want to eat you that's real animals the
02:35:48.640 relationship that you have with a dog is
02:35:50.960 like a child like my dog is more like a
02:35:53.600 child to me than he is like an animal i
02:35:56.720 mean he's like my little friend that
02:35:58.720 doesn't get to speak he doesn't talk but
02:36:01.520 you know
02:36:02.560 an animal in the wild is a competing
02:36:05.840 organism they're competing amongst all
02:36:08.160 the various organisms in whatever
02:36:10.160 ecosystem they're in and either they're
02:36:12.160 at the top or they're somewhere below
02:36:14.720 that and that's just how it goes and
02:36:16.479 every deer is looking around because
02:36:18.720 there's cats and the cats are slowly
02:36:20.640 sneaking up on them every [ __ ] day of
02:36:22.640 the week and if you go in a place where
02:36:24.640 there's deer you best believe there's
02:36:26.160 going to be mountain lions there because
02:36:27.680 that's how it operates right and when
02:36:29.600 you see that in the wat it's so rare
02:36:31.840 it's so rare to be around that but when
02:36:33.520 you see that in the wild then you get a
02:36:35.040 deeper understanding of what it means to
02:36:36.479 be an animal yeah what's horrific is
02:36:39.120 factory farming what's perverse and
02:36:41.359 disgusting is the way animals are
02:36:43.040 treated when these lives these livestock
02:36:46.080 companies
02:36:47.439 pump these animals in these warehouses
02:36:49.359 and make them stand in their own [ __ ]
02:36:50.880 all day and then abuse them and the
02:36:53.280 horrific nature in which they're raised
02:36:54.960 yeah all that should be illegal ag gag
02:36:57.439 laws those laws where whistleblowers get
02:36:59.920 arrested those should be illegal those
02:37:01.680 are immoral they're letting people know
02:37:04.080 what goes into your food and those
02:37:06.399 people are being punished for that all
02:37:08.160 that [ __ ] is
02:37:09.359 being punished because it hurts business
02:37:10.960 yes well it should [ __ ] hurt business
02:37:13.040 you're doing something that we all think
02:37:14.880 is immoral that's how i feel about it i
02:37:18.080 don't think there's anything wrong with
02:37:19.600 even if they if if there should be
02:37:21.520 standards in how cows are raised how
02:37:24.080 chickens are raised let them live like
02:37:26.000 actual cows that's beautiful and there's
02:37:27.920 a way that they can do that where people
02:37:30.160 like chris pratt yeah from guardians
02:37:32.640 again great guy he has he raises sheep
02:37:36.160 and he eats them and he even gives them
02:37:39.040 out to people he has butchers that take
02:37:40.720 care of it these sheep are treated like
02:37:43.680 like they're loved they're not scared of
02:37:45.600 people and then literally
02:37:48.000 they get walked into this room they have
02:37:49.520 no idea what's going to happen a bolt
02:37:51.120 gets put on the top of their head bang
02:37:52.720 and the lights go out now you could say
02:37:55.280 that should never happen and those sheep
02:37:57.280 should just live forever okay you could
02:38:00.000 i could understand that argument or you
02:38:01.840 could say boy
02:38:03.600 if you're going to eat meat and you're
02:38:05.280 going to eat the meat of an animal that
02:38:06.880 you know how it lived and there was no
02:38:09.280 horrific moments in its life it's just
02:38:11.359 one day the lights went out that seems
02:38:12.880 like the best most ethical way to do it
02:38:15.359 maybe even perhaps more ethical than
02:38:16.960 hunting yes because when i'm hunting an
02:38:19.520 animal
02:38:20.479 um
02:38:21.359 it's you know it's out there in this
02:38:23.760 this crazy state where it's always
02:38:25.680 looking to get eaten these sheep have no
02:38:27.439 idea they can be eaten they think that
02:38:29.280 everybody's their buddy and then one day
02:38:31.280 they die
02:38:32.479 yeah man i i agree with that you know
02:38:34.479 like yeah it's difficult to bring ethics
02:38:37.920 to that that's clearly in my view a
02:38:40.319 matter of opinion some people think
02:38:42.399 that's okay but some people say that
02:38:44.399 they could turn it around on me and say
02:38:45.760 you could do that same like thought
02:38:47.760 experience with people like why don't
02:38:49.439 you just eat people well like hey the
02:38:51.120 person led a perfect life you put a bolt
02:38:52.720 in the top of their head and bang shut
02:38:54.160 the lights out and then they turn into
02:38:55.439 barbecue look yeah that's a very
02:38:57.359 pronounced and vivid way but i would say
02:38:59.280 that in a sense we're like we're being
02:39:01.040 commodified imprisoned enclosed like the
02:39:03.760 very fact that a law has been made to
02:39:05.760 prevent people regulating or revealing
02:39:08.560 the truth around that revealing it yeah
02:39:10.399 showing shows where the true bias of
02:39:12.640 this system is in a way i think that one
02:39:14.800 of the cultural jobs this podcast has
02:39:17.680 performed and this is like whether
02:39:19.680 deliberately or not is it demonstrates
02:39:22.640 that the old political lines that we
02:39:25.520 used to comfortably abide within are
02:39:28.000 starting to sort of break down because
02:39:30.880 you know like something like an obvious
02:39:33.120 signifier of a particular type of person
02:39:35.520 ie i go hunt in now we have to accept is
02:39:38.720 coupled with your view that the
02:39:41.280 agricultural industry needs to be
02:39:43.120 regulated and it's disgusting now there
02:39:45.760 you know there we have complete and
02:39:47.359 total agreement and we both can see that
02:39:50.800 the way that legislation is set up is
02:39:52.880 biased towards corporate interest
02:39:55.040 commercial interests and profit you know
02:39:57.600 and so for me
02:39:58.880 bloody whether you know chris pratt
02:40:00.800 having his own sheep i think no problem
02:40:02.479 man well that's not i don't need to
02:40:04.080 spend my time worrying about that i'm a
02:40:05.520 little bit like alex jones like with the
02:40:07.840 why are we worrying about flat earth if
02:40:09.520 they've got them babies and all of that
02:40:11.600 stuff it's like why don't we focus on
02:40:13.760 the things that are making a genuine
02:40:15.760 difference to the the way people are
02:40:17.680 living lives
02:40:19.120 know and it seems to me that the one of
02:40:20.800 the priorities is in a new global
02:40:22.960 landscape that we're living with what
02:40:24.960 are the dominant forces and what are the
02:40:26.880 goals of the dominant forces and how
02:40:28.960 detached are those goals from the lives
02:40:31.520 of what you might say are ordinary
02:40:33.600 people or the majority of people to use
02:40:35.520 a less you know complex term and what's
02:40:38.399 probably most horrific about reforming
02:40:40.399 the system is that the people that are
02:40:41.840 going to suffer the most are the people
02:40:43.200 that are the poorest
02:40:44.640 so like if you think of like fast food
02:40:46.960 in particular right there's a lot of
02:40:48.319 like really poor people that rep rely on
02:40:50.479 fast food because it's very inexpensive
02:40:52.720 if you go and you can get a lot of
02:40:54.160 calories for a small amount of money
02:40:56.640 right
02:40:57.439 but if you go from the fast food
02:41:00.240 restaurant and then you go down the line
02:41:02.160 to factory farming and then somehow
02:41:04.800 another they eliminate factory farming
02:41:06.880 and they say no no if you're going to
02:41:08.080 raise animals you have to have the same
02:41:09.760 sort of standards that we would expect
02:41:12.240 if we knew you if we were there we want
02:41:14.399 pastures we want animals living in the
02:41:16.160 wild we want i mean you know fenced in
02:41:18.399 but like living like an actual animal
02:41:21.520 not this crazy warehouse [ __ ] you
02:41:23.359 guys are running well that's going to up
02:41:24.560 our operation cost well then that's how
02:41:26.479 it's going to be so then the beef
02:41:28.160 becomes far more expensive now if the
02:41:30.240 beef becomes far more expensive then
02:41:32.880 what a fast food what do the restaurants
02:41:34.880 do well they're going to have to make
02:41:35.840 things more expensive too so who's going
02:41:37.439 to suffer the poor people who's going to
02:41:39.120 suffer with cheap meat and supermarkets
02:41:41.600 poor people that can't afford it no but
02:41:43.280 i think what happens joe is you start to
02:41:45.280 you have started to pull a thread that
02:41:47.120 reveals the how the fabric of our
02:41:49.040 culture is corrupted because it
02:41:50.560 shouldn't be more expensive the only
02:41:52.479 reason it's more expensive is because
02:41:54.000 everything is put into a capital-based
02:41:56.560 ideology we're already i've heard many
02:41:58.880 times on the show you discussing
02:42:00.560 universal basic income this is like the
02:42:02.640 beginning of looking at alternative
02:42:04.560 economic models and
02:42:06.880 there's an argument for saying everyone
02:42:08.800 has the right to a nutritious diet
02:42:11.439 everyone has the right to a safe home
02:42:13.920 you know so like you know if we start
02:42:15.280 prioritizing those ideas above these
02:42:17.439 organizations have the right to maximize
02:42:19.600 profit well hold on a sec then
02:42:21.439 maximizing profit that's getting taken
02:42:23.280 off the table and then there comes your
02:42:24.560 counter argument about innovation well i
02:42:26.479 would say if innovation slows
02:42:29.200 no problem because we've our we've
02:42:31.520 decided as a culture to prioritize
02:42:33.439 housing and nutrition for the majority
02:42:35.359 of people now you can say that starts to
02:42:38.000 you know that's that's kind of socialism
02:42:40.080 but and i don't think that that can work
02:42:41.920 on us on a continental scale i think you
02:42:44.800 have to we have to break down
02:42:46.240 centralized systems whether those are
02:42:48.479 corporate centralized systems or
02:42:50.960 national i feel that we these to the
02:42:53.040 time has gone where there's too much
02:42:55.040 diversity like them not to there
02:42:56.880 probably always was diversity people are
02:42:58.720 different we're influenced by our
02:43:00.080 cultures our schools our education our
02:43:01.760 class our races all these factors and
02:43:03.520 then to expect us all to live in this
02:43:05.200 sort of single bandwidth of this is what
02:43:07.359 america is or this is what france is or
02:43:08.960 this is what england is people are it's
02:43:11.040 too different now but what you know it
02:43:12.640 does it seems like the standards we're
02:43:14.479 adhering to unconsciously or otherwise
02:43:16.399 is these groups have the right to make
02:43:18.160 as much money as they can and to
02:43:20.560 interfere with that is un-american or
02:43:22.960 unbritish or whatever it was because you
02:43:24.720 know this is beyond national ideas i'm
02:43:26.720 sure so
02:43:28.000 you know for me that's the you pull that
02:43:30.240 thread oh it's the poor that will suffer
02:43:31.760 well then no we have to rule out the
02:43:33.439 poor suffer so we have so what happens
02:43:35.520 in the end you start to get into
02:43:37.760 redistribution of resources
02:43:40.160 managing and regulating the power of the
02:43:42.640 most powerful people and whenever that
02:43:44.399 conversation starts it gets shut down
02:43:46.080 because we want to conserve even in a
02:43:48.880 capitalist system wouldn't it be more
02:43:50.800 ethical if everybody started from the
02:43:52.319 same starting block well that's what's
02:43:54.160 wrong with the world right what's wrong
02:43:55.680 with the world is some people are in a a
02:43:57.920 they have a terrible hand of cards
02:43:59.279 they've been dealt you know and my point
02:44:01.840 about food is that the people that are
02:44:04.080 gonna they're gonna suffer the most are
02:44:06.479 the people that rely on the cheap food
02:44:08.240 yes as soon as that cheap food gets
02:44:09.920 pulled away
02:44:11.200 then
02:44:12.479 a lot of those supermarkets and a lot of
02:44:15.600 those um fast food stores that rely on
02:44:18.479 that factory farm food
02:44:20.319 you know they're going to be in a bad
02:44:21.439 situation things are going to be much
02:44:23.680 more expensive and if things are much
02:44:25.439 more if they make animals live like
02:44:28.560 what is that guy's name
02:44:30.240 polyface farms joel's
02:44:33.200 salatin
02:44:34.319 yeah he's a fascinating cat i had him on
02:44:36.720 my podcast before he's sort of a farm
02:44:38.880 reformist
02:44:40.160 and what he believes is that these
02:44:41.520 animals should live just like animals
02:44:43.279 when he has pigs he puts them in a
02:44:45.920 fenced area but he moves the fenced area
02:44:48.560 every day so like the pigs move to a
02:44:51.200 different spot and so they're just
02:44:52.560 constantly foraging and eating acorns
02:44:54.880 and
02:44:56.080 but
02:44:56.880 they're
02:44:57.920 you know they're living like a pig
02:44:59.760 they're living in a natural they're not
02:45:01.920 living in some crazy warehouse yes he
02:45:04.000 does same with his chickens he has this
02:45:05.520 mobile chicken coop and he moves it from
02:45:07.200 pasture to pasture and this is how he
02:45:09.120 operates his entire farm
02:45:11.279 yes it seems again that a point that's
02:45:13.840 been we've talked about earlier that we
02:45:16.160 ought to like if we're looking like no
02:45:18.160 one knows what's right so perhaps what
02:45:20.080 we could try and do is replicate what we
02:45:22.640 do naturally and so there is an argument
02:45:25.359 that naturally we do hunt there is a an
02:45:27.840 argument that naturally we do eat meat
02:45:29.680 there is a naturally grown food too
02:45:31.520 though right there's an argument that
02:45:32.800 like was saying like getting into
02:45:34.080 organic gardening if you have your own
02:45:36.240 garden man i mean that is like one of
02:45:37.600 the most karma free things ever if you
02:45:39.680 can figure out a way to have your own
02:45:40.960 compost your own garden and you don't
02:45:43.600 ever have to rely on anybody else for
02:45:45.200 your food well then you're not
02:45:46.399 participating in that [ __ ] at all do you
02:45:48.319 think that the spirit of
02:45:49.279 entrepreneurship could be
02:45:51.200 turned to designing these systems do you
02:45:53.439 think the only thing that incentivizes
02:45:55.439 people is maximum profit i i do too i
02:45:57.680 think that it is possible that people
02:45:58.960 would sit around and go how do we
02:46:00.479 organize a society that's fairer and
02:46:02.800 just that doesn't kill people's
02:46:04.560 individualism or creativity or right to
02:46:06.560 pursue different goals or to be who they
02:46:08.800 are and believe who you know but like i
02:46:10.720 feel like there's so much fog in the air
02:46:12.479 people don't know what they actually
02:46:14.000 believe in because there's so much
02:46:15.200 powerful cultural influence so much
02:46:17.200 toxin physical toxin literal toxins and
02:46:19.840 toxicity cultural toxicity you know how
02:46:22.800 are how am i to
02:46:24.720 uh protect my children from cultural
02:46:27.359 influences they're telling them you have
02:46:28.560 to look this way be this way behave that
02:46:30.160 way these are things that are cool if
02:46:31.600 you're not this you're not a man if
02:46:32.960 you're not this you're not a woman you
02:46:34.399 know like like you know as a parent i
02:46:36.560 feel the obligation to create an
02:46:38.160 environment where they can grow up to be
02:46:39.760 who they are in inverted commerce and
02:46:41.680 then when you sort of scale that up to a
02:46:43.520 society you know how can we start to
02:46:47.040 recognize
02:46:48.560 look is this time to look at different
02:46:50.960 systems for living and i what i feel is
02:46:53.359 people want to be involved in the in the
02:46:55.520 power systems that affect them but if
02:46:57.359 you have a group of 100 people they want
02:46:59.200 to be able to run their own schools run
02:47:01.040 their own care systems run be in charge
02:47:03.760 of their own life not just be some
02:47:05.439 little beam of energy flicked about by
02:47:08.000 cultural forces that they can't reach or
02:47:10.000 touch it's alienating and like one of
02:47:12.640 the things in marxism and that you know
02:47:14.160 and i know very little about this
02:47:15.359 subject is he says that when capitalism
02:47:17.359 reaches a certain point people will be
02:47:20.240 lost alienated they'll feel like a cog
02:47:22.640 in a machine no one will have no pride
02:47:24.800 in their work no one will know what it's
02:47:26.080 like to make a whole bicycle and think
02:47:27.760 look i made that you're just you're the
02:47:29.359 guy that makes the pedals now [ __ ] off
02:47:31.279 home you know now like you know like i'd
02:47:33.359 listen to enough jordan peterson to
02:47:34.720 understand that there are limitations to
02:47:36.880 what socialism and marxism can achieve
02:47:39.359 but just because you know capitalism is
02:47:41.680 better than feudalism that doesn't mean
02:47:44.080 that's the end of the conversation that
02:47:45.760 we shouldn't be looking for fairer
02:47:47.279 better more just ways of living
02:47:49.760 well
02:47:50.640 um yeah i don't know if capitalism is
02:47:53.279 the problems but maybe it's how people
02:47:55.600 engage with capitalism maybe it's what
02:47:57.840 people choose to focus on if you're just
02:47:59.439 about acquiring wealth and money some
02:48:02.240 people are yeah they're going to be very
02:48:03.840 deeply unhappy and it's going to be this
02:48:05.760 weird game of acquiring influence and
02:48:08.080 power until you just have this
02:48:10.319 insurmountable mound of money that you
02:48:12.479 live on top of right
02:48:14.240 i don't think that's a a good way for
02:48:16.160 them either i think if we're going to
02:48:18.080 really
02:48:19.840 we're going to look at this country
02:48:21.279 fairly we have to look at think of all
02:48:23.520 the poor neighborhoods and imagine being
02:48:25.600 born in those poor neighborhoods and
02:48:27.920 imagine being born in a place where
02:48:29.439 there's no resources there's no hell
02:48:31.279 you're living in the [ __ ] mountains
02:48:32.960 of west virginia those coal mining
02:48:35.200 communities or people it's all just
02:48:38.479 mobile homes and pills and it's chaos
02:48:40.960 and just extreme poverty what do you do
02:48:43.439 if you're stuck in there what have you
02:48:44.640 if you're born to that clan that's the
02:48:46.720 group you're born into you're [ __ ] man
02:48:48.560 you're [ __ ] we have to take
02:48:51.200 our resources and concentrate on parts
02:48:53.920 of america the same way we concentrate
02:48:56.479 on many other problem spots in the world
02:48:58.800 and look at them as like hey man there's
02:49:00.399 a spot where people are [ __ ] we should
02:49:02.960 unfuck them we should figure out a way
02:49:05.760 to go into every single horrible
02:49:08.479 community in this country on this planet
02:49:11.040 ones that are just as bad as some that
02:49:12.880 you see in third world countries they
02:49:14.160 exist right here in america fix that
02:49:16.800 don't ignore that that's crazy if
02:49:19.279 they're in detroit if they're in
02:49:21.120 wherever the [ __ ] they are whatever
02:49:22.479 whatever the horrible community is why
02:49:25.359 isn't there a concerted national effort
02:49:27.680 to eliminate that that's a major source
02:49:29.600 of crime it's a major source of prop
02:49:31.760 people feel like they got [ __ ] over in
02:49:33.840 life so they want to get at you and take
02:49:36.640 from you because you got that easy road
02:49:38.479 hey man you're born in the [ __ ]
02:49:39.680 suburbs hey man your mom and dad are
02:49:41.439 still together you know hey man your dad
02:49:43.600 has a job and your mom's at home baking
02:49:45.359 and [ __ ] you live like a [ __ ]
02:49:46.720 norman rockwell movie [ __ ] you man my
02:49:48.800 mom's on crack my mom's a prostitute my
02:49:51.120 life is hell my dad beats me i've been
02:49:53.279 sexually molested since i was a little
02:49:54.800 kid this is the reality that people
02:49:56.479 exist and they don't feel like anybody's
02:49:57.840 coming to help them
02:49:59.359 we we need to concentrate on that the
02:50:01.359 government if the government really
02:50:02.960 cares about us if they're really
02:50:04.319 involved in social engineering and
02:50:06.000 making america better again make those
02:50:08.720 places better those are the price places
02:50:10.800 you need to concentrate on not tax
02:50:12.319 breaks for [ __ ] super rich
02:50:13.600 corporations that get you in place
02:50:15.680 they make enough money man that's not
02:50:17.439 the problem the money is where where the
02:50:19.439 money goes what's it being allocated
02:50:21.359 towards the biggest problem in our
02:50:23.040 country is these in
02:50:24.560 impossible to escape communities yes
02:50:27.040 that so many people just get sucked into
02:50:29.040 this trap and for every person that gets
02:50:30.960 out and becomes a basketball player or a
02:50:33.200 successful business person and they have
02:50:35.359 this story about the poverty that they
02:50:36.880 grew up in they they are so rare yes and
02:50:40.399 then it's not to be applauded that they
02:50:42.479 got through that it is but it's more to
02:50:44.800 be we should understand like hey we've
02:50:46.319 got a real [ __ ] problem that we're
02:50:48.080 churning out all these people that live
02:50:50.319 with they start out in life with a
02:50:52.240 massive deficit start out in life
02:50:54.319 emotionally [ __ ] physically abused
02:50:56.399 they start out with everybody around
02:50:58.640 them is a loser everybody's going to
02:51:00.000 jail everybody is constantly doing pills
02:51:02.479 or this or that they're it's all
02:51:04.560 negative and to to to ask them to
02:51:07.120 develop their own positive mindset
02:51:09.359 uniquely in a vacuum it's preposterous
02:51:11.840 yeah so these pull them up by your booth
02:51:13.439 traps
02:51:14.560 all those [ __ ] hey you got to pull
02:51:16.240 yourself up by your bootstraps like they
02:51:17.600 don't even have boots man you don't
02:51:19.200 understand like you don't know what
02:51:20.479 you're talking about you've never seen
02:51:21.920 it you've never been involved in that
02:51:23.040 kind of poverty it's not fair it's not
02:51:25.520 fair at all if we care about people
02:51:27.279 that's what we should [ __ ] care about
02:51:29.040 yes i couldn't agree much the number one
02:51:30.960 problem and it's everywhere in the world
02:51:32.960 all the all the crime and poverty work
02:51:35.279 imagine if everyone the lowest you could
02:51:38.479 live is like a middle-class existence
02:51:40.080 yes
02:51:41.279 boy
02:51:42.080 everybody would all be a lot more
02:51:43.439 [ __ ] relaxed
02:51:44.880 immediately if you always had meals you
02:51:47.600 always had food you always had a roof
02:51:49.200 over your head everyone lives middle
02:51:50.640 class holy [ __ ] i mean obviously that's
02:51:53.040 way past the expectations that we have
02:51:54.880 right now for the world because like 34
02:51:57.200 000 a year globally puts you in the
02:51:59.520 world one percent
02:52:01.279 you know i mean that's the one if you
02:52:02.720 make 34 000 a year which is hard to live
02:52:05.439 on man yes you're in the one percent of
02:52:07.520 the world
02:52:08.560 but that standard that you've i so very
02:52:11.680 eloquently described is i think
02:52:15.279 achievable and that ought be the aim and
02:52:18.000 when you give just one example of how
02:52:20.160 legislate the bias of legislation is
02:52:22.720 continually to support the powerful
02:52:24.880 while making the just making nominal
02:52:27.680 gestures to poverty good way of putting
02:52:30.399 out nominal gestures like where you put
02:52:32.240 that yeah and like so
02:52:34.800 the the if there is a point to nation if
02:52:37.120 there is a point to a flag in our belief
02:52:39.200 and this idea that there is an america
02:52:41.600 and there is a britain and we're all
02:52:42.880 together and we're all one and we've got
02:52:44.240 a common destiny and a common past then
02:52:46.720 if we're not if we're ignoring and
02:52:48.319 neglecting those communities then i say
02:52:50.080 that is what defines us you know and
02:52:53.040 until there are
02:52:54.640 systems codes regulations that
02:52:57.120 prioritize that we will continue to live
02:53:00.000 in something heading toward if not a
02:53:01.680 dystopia something moving in the
02:53:03.040 direction of dystopia where the
02:53:05.040 priorities and uh dreams are sort of
02:53:08.000 owned really by the kind of
02:53:10.560 bit mad evil insect robot images that
02:53:13.520 we've seen discussed people do get very
02:53:15.680 concerned when someone reaches a point
02:53:17.600 of excessive power and influence like a
02:53:19.760 jeff bezos type character when you see
02:53:22.160 some guy who's not he doesn't have a
02:53:24.319 million dollars like wow guy's got a
02:53:26.640 million dollars like he must be so
02:53:28.160 relaxed he's got so much money no he's
02:53:30.560 got
02:53:31.240 150 billion and he works every day
02:53:34.560 maniacally and he's constantly doing new
02:53:37.359 projects and new things and buying out
02:53:39.279 whole foods and
02:53:40.720 that's like pinnacle capitalism is one
02:53:43.120 of the things that scares people the
02:53:44.160 most when someone just acquires this
02:53:46.240 insane position of power and wealth like
02:53:50.000 a bill gates type character who is very
02:53:53.040 altruistic very very generous bill gates
02:53:55.680 is
02:53:56.479 accused of one of the better examples of
02:53:58.319 someone who gains a lot of money and
02:53:59.760 then does a lot to help people
02:54:01.680 especially in his retirement all they do
02:54:04.080 is focus on charitable organizations and
02:54:06.240 yeah which is brilliant but
02:54:08.160 you know marvelous and you know i'm not
02:54:09.840 not criticizing the great achievements
02:54:11.439 of brilliant people but like but if
02:54:13.439 really for me that demonstrates the lim
02:54:15.040 the limitations come from the type of
02:54:17.279 systems we live in that you can't
02:54:19.040 through charity affect every
02:54:21.040 impoverished community in america you
02:54:23.600 know like we the systems that we have
02:54:25.680 are oh well if you're poor like that you
02:54:27.279 know the bootstrap model well this guy
02:54:29.200 did it look at this great guy who
02:54:30.640 overcame the odds you know until like i
02:54:33.120 feel like in a sense charity has become
02:54:35.200 a kind of valve that allows you know
02:54:37.600 people like you and i who aren't poor to
02:54:40.560 feel like well i do a bit you know i'm
02:54:42.720 sort of involved i can wash my hands of
02:54:44.720 it
02:54:45.680 you know like what
02:54:47.439 these unless we
02:54:49.359 there's there is no america there is no
02:54:51.279 england unless we have integral
02:54:52.960 relationships with one another where we
02:54:54.479 support one another
02:54:56.479 if we really are on a team we see
02:54:58.000 someone who's completely downtrodden
02:54:59.600 who's on our team and we ignore them
02:55:01.600 well that's not much of a [ __ ] team
02:55:03.200 is it no i mean that's what i feel like
02:55:04.880 when i come to red lights and i see
02:55:06.160 homeless people i feel terrible i'm like
02:55:08.960 i feel like you know i mean this part of
02:55:11.680 you is like don't give them any money
02:55:12.880 because they know they're going to just
02:55:13.920 buy drugs you know let them figure it
02:55:16.080 out but then they're not going to figure
02:55:17.200 it out they have mental health issues
02:55:18.880 and they're stuck out here and they're
02:55:20.479 supposedly on the team they're probably
02:55:22.160 born in america they probably have
02:55:23.680 national citizenship here
02:55:26.160 you know they this is our team and no
02:55:28.240 one gives a [ __ ] that they're camped out
02:55:29.439 under the bridge
02:55:30.479 it's like
02:55:31.760 the diffusion of responsibility that
02:55:33.279 comes with these massive numbers 20
02:55:35.439 million in la 300 and plus whatever it
02:55:38.319 is now was like 320 in america yeah it's
02:55:41.120 unbelievable i think there's 90 000 in
02:55:43.279 the general california like a cities
02:55:45.600 worth of homeless people isn't it it's
02:55:47.920 not difficult for me to envisage like
02:55:49.920 when we talk about the transcendent
02:55:52.399 states that can be achieved through
02:55:53.600 meditation and psychedelics meaning that
02:55:55.600 beings like us can access them it's not
02:55:57.760 difficult to envisage human like a type
02:56:00.160 of creature a type of being a little
02:56:02.160 more evolved than us that would look
02:56:03.680 back and say oh my god they allowed
02:56:05.760 homelessness they allowed those
02:56:07.120 impoverished communities oh why was it
02:56:08.720 i've said this belief in competitive
02:56:11.120 systems and survival of the fittest that
02:56:13.120 were resourced from ideas that weren't
02:56:15.439 really meant to be translated into that
02:56:17.279 when you were talking before about like
02:56:18.560 the natural world is fraught with
02:56:20.080 competition and threat of course that is
02:56:22.000 animals so you know i'm not disputing
02:56:23.439 what you're saying there but we can't
02:56:24.640 transpose that into an economic system
02:56:26.240 survival at a fist if you ain't got
02:56:27.680 enough hustle and muscle [ __ ] you you're
02:56:29.600 down by the wayside you know here we
02:56:32.160 have an obligation to aspire to the
02:56:33.760 better parts of our nature not to
02:56:35.680 continually use materialism and
02:56:37.359 rationalism to justify that 20 of the
02:56:39.680 population you know or whatever energy
02:56:41.680 is are just garbage or just waste and
02:56:43.439 they're that's affordable we can accord
02:56:45.359 we can live with that it's for me it's
02:56:47.840 that's why would we once we have the
02:56:50.000 knowledge that oh yeah we shouldn't be
02:56:51.279 farming in that way oh we shouldn't have
02:56:52.720 social systems all of the the answer is
02:56:54.319 always the same because if you were to
02:56:55.920 change in that area it will affect the
02:56:58.240 interest of the powerful it will affect
02:57:00.080 impede the ability of certain
02:57:01.200 organizations to make profit now i'm you
02:57:03.359 know i'm not talking about you know i
02:57:04.880 don't know the lexicon enough around
02:57:06.640 socialism and capitalism and marxism and
02:57:09.520 various forms of social organization i'm
02:57:11.520 just talking about my assumption that
02:57:12.880 we're all resourced from the same basic
02:57:15.359 material and phenomena we all have
02:57:17.680 compassion and love in us and if we on
02:57:20.160 an individual level can achieve some
02:57:21.760 level of access to that then we can
02:57:23.600 start to organize ourselves on that
02:57:25.359 basis not on the basis of well what's
02:57:27.439 the most i can get as an individual it's
02:57:28.960 rational for me to i'm not involved in
02:57:31.359 that that doesn't affect me personally
02:57:33.600 you know and i think it's a hard thing
02:57:34.880 for us to hold i think the reason we all
02:57:36.720 do just live with homelessness and the
02:57:38.640 only decision we make is do we put a
02:57:40.479 couple of dollars out the window at the
02:57:41.920 light or not then like
02:57:44.319 it's hard to hold that it's hard to love
02:57:46.160 more than 100 people there's no fix
02:57:49.439 like there's no as an individual but not
02:57:51.680 as not one person and even collectively
02:57:54.560 as a group when you have mental health
02:57:56.240 issues unless you want to
02:57:57.680 institutionalize those people
02:57:59.680 yeah but then who here's the thing right
02:58:02.399 if everyone has a unique and
02:58:06.080 if everyone has their own ideas about
02:58:08.319 what to do with their life and everyone
02:58:09.359 has freedom what if you just don't have
02:58:10.880 enough people that are interested in in
02:58:13.120 mental health of the homeless people you
02:58:14.880 just don't have enough there's no
02:58:15.920 resources guaranteed the resources yeah
02:58:18.240 that's a big question because our
02:58:19.359 systems are biased in a particular
02:58:20.880 direction what if they have
02:58:22.479 government funding do you think that
02:58:23.760 they could
02:58:24.800 cure homelessness one of the advantages
02:58:26.560 i've got of being a drug addict is it
02:58:28.000 means i have to help other drug addicts
02:58:29.520 as part of my own recovery this puts me
02:58:31.600 into areas institutions groups
02:58:33.520 facilities where i meet and drug addicts
02:58:35.040 and always what you'll find the people
02:58:36.880 that work there there's always someone
02:58:38.160 like a man or a woman most often in my
02:58:39.920 personal experience is a woman some
02:58:41.279 matriarchal woman full of mother energy
02:58:43.840 that just will do this [ __ ] forever for
02:58:46.319 free for nothing that just loves it
02:58:47.920 let's just put herself like my
02:58:49.840 grandmother did or my mother did or like
02:58:52.000 these women do between people in the
02:58:54.319 gutter they're just willing to say i'll
02:58:56.000 be the person i'll be the person in l.a
02:58:58.240 at friendly house it was a woman called
02:58:59.520 peggy albrecht that used to run a play
02:59:01.040 uh friendly houses for women that have
02:59:02.640 got drug and addiction and abuse issues
02:59:04.720 and like this woman she was from chicago
02:59:06.720 she was 90 years old by the time like i
02:59:09.920 met she was so rude and brilliant and
02:59:12.640 beautiful and entirely willing to
02:59:14.240 dedicate herself and i think every
02:59:15.760 community everywhere everyone knows
02:59:17.840 people like that and i feel that the
02:59:19.520 same way as like if it is someone that's
02:59:21.040 got a great capacity to play basketball
02:59:22.560 or be a comic like i think that when you
02:59:24.319 spot those people that you
02:59:27.120 they're encouraged at helping people
02:59:28.800 yeah the talent of compassion and you
02:59:30.880 know but we don't value that unless it's
02:59:32.800 like unless it can be turned to a profit
02:59:34.080 [ __ ] off all of those organizations like
02:59:36.000 those
02:59:36.880 organizations that help people with
02:59:38.000 addiction issues you know like they are
02:59:40.720 maligned and like the the people that
02:59:42.720 profit from the opioid crisis they are
02:59:44.720 supported they are able to conceal as
02:59:46.560 john oliver brilliantly revealed that
02:59:48.399 they're able to conceal their practices
02:59:50.319 continually the invisible bias is in the
02:59:52.960 direction of profit and like the failure
02:59:55.840 of
02:59:56.560 certain types of socialism doesn't mean
02:59:58.319 that's the end of the argument i think
02:59:59.439 we have an obligation to look for ways
03:00:01.760 of accessing our own
03:00:03.600 uh higher nature better nature kinder
03:00:06.000 nature call it what you will and seeing
03:00:07.520 how we can organize that as an
03:00:09.439 individual you can do so much i mean if
03:00:11.439 bill gates can you know [ __ ] know i
03:00:13.439 don't know cure malaria and make the
03:00:15.279 significant charitable you know these
03:00:16.960 impressive powerful people can't make a
03:00:19.520 meaningful difference then clearly this
03:00:21.359 is a systemic problem well there's also
03:00:23.520 the problem with homeless people and
03:00:24.720 that they're adults
03:00:26.399 when you become an adult and you develop
03:00:28.800 from the time of your child it's
03:00:30.000 probably
03:00:30.880 very likely that the damage was all done
03:00:32.880 while they were young they were probably
03:00:34.479 abused and neglected and there's a lot
03:00:36.640 of issues that led them to either
03:00:39.040 have mental health problems or they had
03:00:40.720 mental health problems already maybe
03:00:42.640 they have genetic problems then on top
03:00:44.080 of that there's drug abuse
03:00:45.920 for each one of those people to get well
03:00:49.040 you're going to need a massive amount of
03:00:50.640 folks you're not going to have one old
03:00:52.160 lady who's rude who's fun and brilliant
03:00:54.880 that's a cute movie no but that's 20
03:00:57.040 people but i think this is a good movie
03:00:59.760 write it down i could be rich yeah who
03:01:02.160 would be the woman
03:01:03.359 who player
03:01:05.439 i would have liked the one that was uh
03:01:07.200 out of golden girls is still getting
03:01:09.439 she's still available i thought oh god
03:01:11.600 that's a wrap still around betty white's
03:01:13.359 still hanging in there yeah but would
03:01:14.800 you book a movie around her stink hang
03:01:16.479 on
03:01:21.040 yeah it's um no you're right look
03:01:22.800 there's limitations to the individual
03:01:23.920 but there's not like crush this optimism
03:01:25.760 in the crib now joe because i feel like
03:01:29.040 crashing the optimism but i'm saying the
03:01:31.279 logistics of it would almost be
03:01:33.279 insurmountable and it's very referred to
03:01:35.520 logistics is not an objective thing it's
03:01:38.160 a thing that's been biased over time
03:01:40.240 sort of once a person is developed once
03:01:42.720 they're a human it's very difficult to
03:01:44.479 turn that train around yeah if we can
03:01:47.040 save the community
03:01:49.200 and save the future like help like less
03:01:53.520 people get through [ __ ] help let help
03:01:56.800 more people get through with hope and
03:01:58.960 with a real possibility for improving
03:02:01.040 their life versus
03:02:03.200 have this sense of hopelessness that
03:02:04.960 many are confronted with that's going to
03:02:06.640 make
03:02:07.520 less crime i agree that's like that's
03:02:09.359 just if they if someone looked at it
03:02:11.520 from a social engineering standpoint it
03:02:13.279 almost seems like the only way that
03:02:14.560 would ever have to happen would be
03:02:16.160 there's be some [ __ ] catastrophe that
03:02:18.080 forced people to act
03:02:19.520 we sometimes need something that's
03:02:21.600 shoved in our face to force us to act
03:02:23.920 but
03:02:24.640 if someone brilliantly
03:02:26.720 calculated the amount of resources that
03:02:28.800 it would require and then also
03:02:30.479 brilliantly calculated how much less
03:02:31.920 crime it would have how much less how
03:02:34.319 many more
03:02:35.359 innovations because people didn't waste
03:02:37.279 their lives in fact they got through
03:02:39.359 life and used one of the most valuable
03:02:41.760 resources we have which is the human
03:02:43.439 imagination and creativity and ingenuity
03:02:45.760 like and we're missing that on these
03:02:47.600 people that are growing up in these
03:02:49.279 horrible environments where they can't
03:02:50.960 escape they're so [ __ ] from they're in
03:02:53.120 gangs they're you know the crime and
03:02:55.439 poverty and violence they're so [ __ ]
03:02:57.520 that whatever genius they have is wasted
03:03:00.479 on this nonsensical existence if they
03:03:03.040 could just show that and quantify how
03:03:05.520 much that would be how valuable that
03:03:07.680 would be to the overall culture and
03:03:09.600 community of the co of the continent and
03:03:11.840 then ultimately of the earth i mean you
03:03:13.920 would have a reason to engineer and
03:03:15.600 think about this yeah it's a beautiful
03:03:17.359 that is really beautiful and it's
03:03:19.040 interesting that the way that i agree
03:03:21.040 with you that it almost has to at some
03:03:22.880 point be translated into monetary
03:03:25.520 value because otherwise people don't
03:03:27.760 seem to read it yeah and safety for
03:03:30.479 everybody for them who live in these
03:03:32.560 horrible communities wouldn't be great
03:03:34.160 again if everybody lived like a middle
03:03:35.840 class person the idea that that's
03:03:37.760 impossible seems so insane it almost
03:03:40.399 seems like well then nobody should live
03:03:41.840 like that then like either everybody
03:03:43.680 should be able to live like that or
03:03:44.720 nobody should build a way that that was
03:03:46.000 like that's what everybody really wants
03:03:48.080 right you want to be comfortable
03:03:50.319 like in terms of like your ability to
03:03:52.319 exist and then all the things you're
03:03:54.479 doing that you struggle with should be
03:03:57.760 a good percentage of them other than
03:03:59.439 emotional and friendship type things
03:04:00.800 should be of your own choosing
03:04:02.560 you choose to to take a difficult path
03:04:04.960 you choose to take an adventure you
03:04:07.359 choose to try to enrich yourself with
03:04:10.399 this difficult experience and the
03:04:11.840 challenge of it and try to overcome that
03:04:13.439 challenge instead of you your challenge
03:04:16.080 is not to get killed by a gang
03:04:18.160 you know your your challenge is not get
03:04:19.760 [ __ ] by your uncle again you know what
03:04:21.520 i mean i mean this is what people have
03:04:23.040 to deal with and you're you're missing
03:04:25.600 these brilliant minds they don't get
03:04:27.439 this chance to come through and and
03:04:29.600 sneak through that [ __ ] salmon ladder
03:04:32.000 you know
03:04:33.040 get up to the top it's very beautiful
03:04:35.920 that you're uh passionate about this and
03:04:38.640 i think popularizing these ideas
03:04:41.359 is important because i feel that then
03:04:44.479 people will be familiar with this kind
03:04:46.160 of language and will recognize that when
03:04:48.880 there is political discourse how phatic
03:04:51.760 and empty it is that people will say you
03:04:55.200 know like i think in the last election
03:04:56.880 in your country it was clear that there
03:05:00.000 was no one no one is saying that no no
03:05:03.439 one is standing on a political platform
03:05:05.120 of do you know what everyone should
03:05:06.240 basically be able to live a middle class
03:05:07.760 uh lifestyle there's no reason there's
03:05:09.279 enough resources we can do this we could
03:05:11.120 organize society on that basis because
03:05:13.120 that's considered
03:05:14.760 outlandish and crazy and we're so
03:05:17.840 there's so much i can again you know
03:05:19.200 with your well um imaginary lissa the
03:05:22.080 listener that would consider this
03:05:23.439 pontification you know there's so much
03:05:25.359 anger i can i feel that a lot of
03:05:27.600 political events that have occurred in
03:05:29.040 the last five years are the
03:05:30.000 manifestation of a social rage of people
03:05:32.960 that are pissed off with not being heard
03:05:35.680 are pissed off with a cultural
03:05:37.040 conversation that didn't include them
03:05:39.760 and that they feel angry and i don't
03:05:41.680 want to help other people [ __ ] those but
03:05:43.279 you know that that resource is becoming
03:05:45.760 sort of
03:05:46.640 nurtured and grown and it i feel people
03:05:49.359 would feel tremendous relief to let go
03:05:51.600 of that to feel like listen it's all
03:05:53.760 right for you to be you
03:05:56.160 could we be a little more aspirational
03:05:58.399 and a little and consider what our goals
03:06:01.120 are consider what progress looks like to
03:06:03.920 us is progress the terrifying robots or
03:06:06.479 is progress considering elevating the
03:06:09.279 lowest among us to raise the standards
03:06:12.080 if people could just understand that
03:06:13.439 this this is not forever you don't there
03:06:16.160 is no such thing as forever this is a
03:06:17.760 temporary thing and you've gotta try to
03:06:21.680 eat as much good out of this as you can
03:06:23.600 and to go against my point you know
03:06:25.439 there's a real problem with people being
03:06:27.040 lazy people are lazy there's not an
03:06:29.359 equality of effort the the idea of a
03:06:32.000 quality of outcome like people want you
03:06:34.080 know income equality well there's no
03:06:35.920 effort equality
03:06:37.359 that's just the fact there's people out
03:06:38.800 there that are just they work harder
03:06:40.560 they're smarter they're more focused
03:06:42.560 they're less distracted they're more
03:06:44.399 dedicated they have a better plan
03:06:46.080 they've thought it through better and
03:06:47.200 they become more successful and the idea
03:06:48.960 that they become more successful than
03:06:50.800 you
03:06:51.600 because somehow or another there's some
03:06:53.439 nefarious actions afoot well that that
03:06:56.160 negates another possibility which is
03:06:57.920 you're a lazy [ __ ] that's a possibility
03:07:00.319 yes and what do we do about those people
03:07:02.000 i tell you this i've got a plan for the
03:07:03.600 lazy what do i do lazy island
03:07:06.080 you're all going to lazy it's a bit like
03:07:07.520 pinocchio's donkey
03:07:09.680 no arcade games though they're too lazy
03:07:11.680 i feel like um well i consider this that
03:07:15.040 people that don't have a lot of life
03:07:17.200 force like
03:07:19.439 i feel like it's a gift to be a person
03:07:21.120 that's got a lot of drive to be a person
03:07:22.800 that's like i'm [ __ ] going to achieve
03:07:24.000 this [ __ ] you know like some people are
03:07:26.000 a little lethargic and don't have a lot
03:07:27.600 of energy i feel that's a kind of
03:07:28.880 despondency we could break that down in
03:07:30.720 a thousand different ways is it poor
03:07:32.240 diet is it poor role models is it poor
03:07:34.560 social conditioning who are these lazy
03:07:36.840 people because it could be weak could be
03:07:38.479 even weak genes so then we'd like in the
03:07:40.319 territory of disability so however you
03:07:42.720 look at it i think you end up at a point
03:07:44.720 of compassion i think you so i think we
03:07:47.040 should start at the point of compassion
03:07:48.960 because i thought like what is tolerance
03:07:51.120 if it isn't the tolerance of people that
03:07:53.040 we sort of can't understand as long as
03:07:55.920 they carry their own weight we usually
03:07:58.000 don't have a problem with it but when
03:07:59.520 they're so lazy they just juke the
03:08:02.160 system and
03:08:03.840 screw people over and figure their way
03:08:06.319 to scam through life yeah but i think
03:08:08.560 those people don't exist only at the
03:08:10.479 bottom of the social ladder i think they
03:08:12.240 exist at the top and the effect there is
03:08:14.319 worse are you talking about the
03:08:15.359 president united states this is my
03:08:17.359 country [ __ ] you better be
03:08:27.600 i interviewed him about five years ago i
03:08:29.520 was doing something before he was the
03:08:30.800 president
03:08:31.600 he was okay near him
03:08:38.479 like he um yeah he was sort of sweet but
03:08:40.960 i remember thinking what i felt was
03:08:43.359 why you don't have no intellectual
03:08:45.120 curiosity that's what i felt well that's
03:08:47.200 what i felt i felt like i was sort of
03:08:48.880 liked him he was nice and his staff at
03:08:50.880 that big tower they all loved him
03:08:54.960 and i don't think he's been very genuine
03:08:56.240 with that great make america great again
03:08:58.080 do you i don't like where's that
03:08:59.600 everyone should be middle class we're
03:09:00.800 going to start reorganizing society
03:09:02.319 reaching out into detroit and in a
03:09:03.760 crushed mining towns in west virginia
03:09:05.520 where's that otherwise you ain't making
03:09:07.120 america great again that's true that's
03:09:08.880 true but think about how we were talking
03:09:10.640 about dave chappelle about one of the
03:09:11.920 reasons why he's so great other than the
03:09:13.840 fact that he's smart and just talented
03:09:16.399 and all these good things is that he
03:09:18.479 knows what he does and he does it right
03:09:20.640 that's his wheelhouse he stays in there
03:09:23.040 trump's wheelhouse is making giant gold
03:09:25.600 buildings with his name on him
03:09:27.840 and spray tan he knows what the [ __ ] to
03:09:29.920 do and he knows how to make money and he
03:09:31.760 doesn't give a [ __ ] about all that other
03:09:33.520 stuff because that other stuff is wasted
03:09:35.279 energy for him his energy is in focusing
03:09:38.479 on how you get more buildings with those
03:09:40.240 giant gold trump letters on it and no
03:09:42.240 one can argue that it's been a
03:09:43.520 tremendous success i once stayed in one
03:09:45.439 of those hotels the water bottle had his
03:09:47.439 face on it you know what i mean he's
03:09:48.800 amazing incredible
03:09:50.720 what an achievement
03:09:52.399 drinking the inside of his face but
03:09:54.640 that's his thing right it's like why is
03:09:56.880 it okay for your thing to be tennis
03:09:59.600 and that's all you know about i don't
03:10:00.960 even pay attention to the politics why
03:10:02.800 is that okay but when we see a guy like
03:10:05.200 him we have a problem with it because
03:10:06.880 he's not his intellectual curiosity is
03:10:08.960 only about money so it's even grosser i
03:10:11.200 agree listen there's nowhere to return
03:10:13.439 to my point i
03:10:14.720 wouldn't waste time judging anyone as an
03:10:18.240 individual because i imagine if i were
03:10:19.920 to spend time examining donald trump's
03:10:22.479 past his relationship with his father
03:10:24.160 the conditions he grew up in what he
03:10:25.760 felt he had to do to be a good person i
03:10:28.000 would imagine i'd go yeah of course but
03:10:29.920 what i would query is a system that
03:10:32.240 elevates the people like that and i you
03:10:35.040 know the two positions of incredible
03:10:36.800 power like and you know again i believe
03:10:39.439 that it's systems that need to change
03:10:41.040 not individuals and i think we've overly
03:10:42.720 fetishized politics i don't live in this
03:10:44.640 country so i don't know if it's much
03:10:46.080 worse under trump i've heard some things
03:10:47.359 that sound really bad than it was under
03:10:49.359 barack obama but what my more my general
03:10:51.920 belief is you
03:10:53.760 don't fetishize individuals and get
03:10:55.279 distracted think about changing the
03:10:56.640 system because you're not getting that
03:10:58.000 middle class lifestyle for everyone
03:11:00.720 neither no one's offering that bernie
03:11:02.240 sanders isn't offering that no one's
03:11:03.680 offering about and unless someone's
03:11:04.720 offering that what's the where why
03:11:06.640 should we get involved have you ever
03:11:07.840 talked to economists about like what is
03:11:10.080 the problem what's the like people that
03:11:12.160 are you know more
03:11:13.760 socialistic minded they'd be more
03:11:15.840 socialist minded i guess
03:11:18.160 but but understanding of capitalism to
03:11:20.319 the point where they could point out the
03:11:21.359 flaws in allowing this infinite growth
03:11:24.160 model where someone gets to a point like
03:11:25.760 a jeff bezos or something like that what
03:11:27.520 would they do to mitigate that you're
03:11:29.040 not going to put a cap like that's when
03:11:31.200 people say that like
03:11:32.720 you're going to pay 70 in taxes over 10
03:11:35.439 million dollars that was like one of the
03:11:36.800 ones that was banded about people just
03:11:38.399 start laughing like you're out of your
03:11:39.520 [ __ ] mind no one's gonna do that
03:11:40.880 they'll get to 10 million dollars and
03:11:42.240 then they'll stop yeah it's stupid it's
03:11:45.120 that's i think a very limiting system
03:11:48.240 and i feel that the problems are broader
03:11:50.720 than that i think that like did you ever
03:11:52.640 see like you know if you ever watched
03:11:54.080 steve bannon talk that he's a man like
03:11:55.680 you know someone i would again not
03:11:57.279 politically agree with for what it's
03:11:59.520 worth but when his description of what
03:12:01.840 happened in that economic crash of 2008
03:12:05.040 and the decisions that were made for the
03:12:07.040 you know american taxpayer to bail out
03:12:09.359 the like financial industry and i've
03:12:11.040 subsequently seen a documentary that
03:12:12.399 said look this is why we had to do that
03:12:13.680 these were the options but like for me
03:12:16.479 that is a demonstration of capitalism's
03:12:18.880 inherent failings and limitations but
03:12:21.120 we're not talking about a system that is
03:12:22.720 flawless and perfect it's pretty [ __ ]
03:12:24.240 flawed aside from the human collateral
03:12:26.000 damage and that you have again described
03:12:27.920 the the communities that are
03:12:29.279 impoverished and without hope and living
03:12:30.720 in poverty in a kind of slavery you know
03:12:32.880 it even in itself doesn't work according
03:12:35.439 to its own rules it has to be
03:12:36.800 artificially
03:12:38.160 sustained and rebooted when it
03:12:40.640 inevitably fails so the pure sign of it
03:12:43.680 is the fact that no one went to jail for
03:12:45.520 the subprime mortgage crisis yeah those
03:12:47.920 guys didn't go to jail all those guys
03:12:49.359 that with the real financial analysts
03:12:51.120 were looking at from a distance they
03:12:52.319 were going i see where this is going
03:12:54.160 like this is going to blow up and a lot
03:12:55.600 of people are going to lose their houses
03:12:56.640 like you guys are [ __ ] like yeah and
03:12:58.800 there was a lot of people that engaged
03:13:00.399 in those predatory loans and they didn't
03:13:02.640 get punished those those guys the
03:13:04.800 craziest thing is a lot of them got
03:13:06.399 bonuses
03:13:07.600 yes that's right they got bonuses even
03:13:09.439 if the bank got bailed out and they said
03:13:11.040 the bonuses are part of their contracts
03:13:12.880 and if they didn't honor their contracts
03:13:14.560 they'd have a hard time hiring these
03:13:16.160 people and there would be chaos and they
03:13:18.880 just made it a reason why they had to
03:13:20.720 give them millions of dollars in bonuses
03:13:23.040 yeah when they failed
03:13:24.880 you get a bonus and you failed like your
03:13:27.600 bank failed and you still get a bonus
03:13:30.080 like you knew about those predatory
03:13:32.080 loans you knew about those you knew
03:13:34.160 about the sub prime mortgage [ __ ]
03:13:36.000 that was going down in your business
03:13:37.840 yeah you just let it ride and now you're
03:13:39.520 gonna get up you're gonna get a bonus
03:13:41.520 what's the bonus for
03:13:43.439 yeah what would you have to do to be
03:13:45.120 fined if that's yeah that's the bonus
03:13:47.600 dude be jailed yeah i mean just think
03:13:50.000 about what they're doing to julian
03:13:51.200 assange right they're they're they're
03:13:53.600 throwing that guy in a jail somewhere
03:13:55.200 that didn't look good that embassy move
03:13:57.439 no but i mean the fact that what he did
03:13:59.760 was release information that everybody
03:14:01.600 found very interesting
03:14:03.760 and what they did is crash the whole
03:14:05.760 [ __ ] economy right it's pretty good
03:14:08.080 that he was able to ride that embassy
03:14:09.920 idea for as long as because it's not
03:14:11.359 actually in another country is it it's
03:14:13.439 in london i know it is i went and
03:14:14.800 visited him in there as a matter of fact
03:14:16.640 just briefly popped in so what do you
03:14:18.160 think's gonna happen with him i think
03:14:19.520 he's gonna end up serving a pretty lumpy
03:14:22.239 prison sentence somewhere isn't abram i
03:14:24.319 think they're going to get them on
03:14:25.359 though like what are they going to
03:14:26.319 charge them on they're charging around
03:14:27.920 like hacking charges or some [ __ ] now
03:14:29.680 which they didn't charge them on before
03:14:31.600 right is that what's emerged and he's
03:14:33.040 going to be extradited to this country
03:14:34.560 is that true i don't know i don't know
03:14:37.359 well i mean again i suppose this is what
03:14:39.439 happens if you challenge the interests
03:14:41.040 of the powerful if trump was really
03:14:43.279 trump really wanted to get people on the
03:14:44.560 side he'd pardon him
03:14:46.560 do you think that that would be popular
03:14:47.920 because like someone like that edward
03:14:48.960 snowden is it like look i'm sort of
03:14:51.600 obviously i think don't put the lives of
03:14:53.760 people at risk that are in compromised
03:14:56.000 military positions that seems like a
03:14:57.600 fairly obvious thing but like i don't
03:14:58.880 think they did that but no what i
03:15:00.640 understood was they got hacked and
03:15:02.640 someone else released the the documents
03:15:05.200 without the names redacted yeah it seems
03:15:07.120 to me wikileaks never did that edward's
03:15:09.359 ed snowden seems to qualify for a hero
03:15:12.000 in pretty much any way you look at it
03:15:13.439 he's a 26 year old person making that
03:15:14.960 decision and yeah very brilliant you
03:15:16.800 know i've heard him uh i think he was on
03:15:18.560 neil degrasse tyson's podcast they
03:15:20.239 talked to him oh wow via skype or
03:15:22.800 however they did it but did you see in
03:15:24.800 citizen four there's a bit like in that
03:15:26.479 film about edward snowden citizen four
03:15:28.319 there's a bit where he's just come out
03:15:29.600 and he's talking to the journalists or
03:15:31.040 filmmakers that are making the film and
03:15:32.319 he's going they can [ __ ] watch you
03:15:33.279 with this phone you can't leave that
03:15:34.479 like he's like in the sort of a state of
03:15:36.319 mad enlightenment where he's just seen
03:15:38.000 the truth if they're listening to us now
03:15:39.359 you can't [ __ ] have that on you don't
03:15:40.640 let him like it's terrifying to watch
03:15:42.399 someone because you know obviously now
03:15:43.760 he's calmed down he's dealt with it he
03:15:45.200 understands that you know but he was
03:15:46.319 like a person that was emerging from
03:15:47.920 having seen the other side of the matrix
03:15:49.600 yeah i mean i mean he was deep into it
03:15:51.279 and then when he revealed all the
03:15:52.640 information they had a [ __ ] they were
03:15:54.800 had a manhunt for him the guy had a
03:15:56.880 hideout in russia he had to seek asylum
03:15:59.359 in our enemy yes the whole thing is so
03:16:02.239 strange yeah so who do our power
03:16:04.160 structures actually support if someone
03:16:06.000 tells the truth to the population they
03:16:07.520 have to flee to russia if someone talks
03:16:09.920 about improper agricultural practices
03:16:11.920 that's against the law they can be
03:16:13.120 imprisoned that it starts to reveal that
03:16:15.600 the state itself the very thing that we
03:16:17.200 revere the very thing that we identify
03:16:19.359 is the tool of our oppression they want
03:16:22.239 to discourage people from leaking
03:16:24.080 information that makes them look
03:16:25.359 horrible it's that simple yeah it's just
03:16:27.520 it's that simple if you look at what
03:16:29.680 information he leaked and what what it
03:16:31.840 did
03:16:32.720 well it
03:16:34.239 you know
03:16:35.760 what he did was he revealed things that
03:16:38.000 everyone wanted to know about that we
03:16:40.319 felt were crimes it makes me feel that
03:16:42.800 it's as simple as if you knew what we do
03:16:46.000 in order to keep [ __ ] running you would
03:16:48.239 revolt so we are never going to let you
03:16:50.720 know well that for me in a sense is a
03:16:52.720 past that's starting well hold on
03:16:54.160 [ __ ] who are you i thought you are
03:16:56.239 elected officials you're one of us but
03:16:58.399 no you're above us to the point where
03:17:00.000 someone leaks information about your
03:17:01.760 crimes
03:17:03.040 they get locked in this embassy for
03:17:05.040 seven years like what is their crime
03:17:07.439 exactly in comparison to the crimes that
03:17:09.200 he's revealed yes like that's where it's
03:17:12.160 crazy
03:17:13.920 when you look at the the balance the
03:17:16.160 imbalance between
03:17:17.680 what his crime is and the crimes that
03:17:19.920 he's revealed i mean he's revealed some
03:17:22.640 staggering crimes
03:17:24.640 and no one's concentrating on that the
03:17:26.080 government is not freaking out we gotta
03:17:28.000 we've left some obviously uh we have
03:17:29.680 work to do we have corrections to make
03:17:31.680 there's none of that talk there's get
03:17:33.279 that guy talk yeah that's right and i
03:17:35.120 mean like it's sort of under the veil of
03:17:37.600 patriotism a lot can be concealed and
03:17:40.160 and that is a an incident that
03:17:42.880 passes through several administrations
03:17:45.520 so like you you've been there for seven
03:17:47.520 years
03:17:48.640 yes it makes you think well what is the
03:17:50.239 what are the differences you know like i
03:17:52.399 kind of you know sort of i been on bill
03:17:54.640 maher show i like bill maher i'm i'm you
03:17:56.800 know very simplified uh left you know
03:17:58.880 i'm ultimately beyond left left wing i'm
03:18:00.880 you know trying to my belief is that we
03:18:02.640 should try and organize a system based
03:18:04.080 on a hallucigenic experience for [ __ ]
03:18:05.840 sake there's there's no party for me and
03:18:07.680 i'm not even allowed the [ __ ]
03:18:08.640 hallucigens so like you know so like i'm
03:18:10.880 like you know i'm not a right-wing
03:18:12.720 person it's safe to say but like i feel
03:18:15.520 that so many of the problems that we're
03:18:17.200 experiencing now is because the the
03:18:19.120 democratic left-wing liberal
03:18:21.120 organizations stopped serving the people
03:18:23.279 they were in the case of the british
03:18:24.479 labour party designed or set up to surf
03:18:27.359 they neglected them they abandoned them
03:18:29.439 you know the white with the white
03:18:31.120 working class in britain were 50 60
03:18:33.040 years ago told hey there's this thing
03:18:34.479 called britain we want you to go out
03:18:35.920 there and fight and die for it give up
03:18:37.760 your sons get out there oh and now
03:18:39.680 they're told hey there's no such thing
03:18:41.200 as britain and like yeah
03:18:43.600 no wonder people are confused no wonder
03:18:46.399 people are baffled no wonder there are
03:18:48.239 abandoned constituencies and despair and
03:18:51.040 rage
03:18:52.160 and i i feel that in a way
03:18:54.880 it's like what is patriotism resourced
03:18:57.200 from a sense that we all need to belong
03:18:59.439 that we want to be together that you
03:19:01.359 know that we're willing to believe in a
03:19:03.040 fictional idea
03:19:04.479 a flag and a story about you know the
03:19:07.359 origin of a nation whether that's an old
03:19:09.359 one like mine or a new one like this one
03:19:11.680 you know we're willing to participate in
03:19:13.600 that but if those values aren't real if
03:19:15.920 they aren't like if it is we are going
03:19:17.600 to support the most powerful we will lie
03:19:19.200 to you whenever necessary when our lies
03:19:21.760 are revealed we'll imprison punish and
03:19:23.520 lie about those people we don't care
03:19:25.359 about the most vulnerable what the [ __ ]
03:19:27.520 is the flag that we're waving who is it
03:19:29.680 for
03:19:30.479 it's a good point and on that note let's
03:19:32.479 wrap this [ __ ] up good we went out high
