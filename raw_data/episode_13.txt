00:00:11.360 day going all right how are you sir good
00:00:13.799 man how are you doing very nice to meet
00:00:14.839 you yeah nice to meet you too what is it
00:00:16.560 like uh running for vice president of
00:00:18.720 the United States how crazy is this
00:00:21.439 experience uh it's pretty weird it's
00:00:22.840 pretty weird uh you know I was just
00:00:25.119 telling you this earlier but the first
00:00:27.760 time that I've been in a public spot
00:00:29.240 without Secret in the room is right now
00:00:31.640 so I'm like looking around for these
00:00:32.920 guys because I'm used to having them
00:00:34.879 it's 3 months right so he he asked me
00:00:37.440 the Monday of the RNC convention which I
00:00:39.079 think was June
00:00:40.640 15th and I really didn't know that
00:00:42.800 morning I thought that he was probably
00:00:44.680 going to pick me but I didn't know for
00:00:46.199 sure probably 6040 basically and so I
00:00:49.559 had no idea I get the call around 1:00
00:00:53.000 at Milwaukee time at the RNC convention
00:00:55.480 I'm hanging out with my kid another one
00:00:57.160 of my kids is in the other room asleep
00:00:59.160 cuz you know our kids are young so they
00:01:00.440 nap still and uh he makes this call and
00:01:03.199 he's like hey do you want to be my vice
00:01:04.799 president I was like was it literally
00:01:06.240 just like that well actually what what
00:01:08.560 happened is I get a text message from a
00:01:10.600 staff member on his team that says he
00:01:12.759 just missed a very important phone call
00:01:15.080 and I don't know you know cuz there's so
00:01:16.640 much inbound traffic that I think it
00:01:18.880 just went straight to voicemail so I
00:01:20.360 call him back and I'm like Hey sir
00:01:22.600 what's going on he said JD you just
00:01:24.159 missed a very important phone call I'm
00:01:25.880 going to have to pick somebody else
00:01:28.439 now you know so I'm about to [ __ ] a
00:01:30.520 brick here and then he says no no I'm
00:01:32.799 just kidding obviously want you to be my
00:01:34.399 vice president and the the funny thing
00:01:37.119 is you know my seven-year-old is in the
00:01:39.200 background and he has no idea what's
00:01:40.880 going on and I love that right it's one
00:01:42.119 of the good things about this he has no
00:01:43.479 clue what's going on he's like Daddy who
00:01:45.360 are you talking to he's talking about
00:01:46.680 Pokemon cards right and um I you know
00:01:50.159 Trump hears my son in the background and
00:01:52.479 he says well uh who's that and I said
00:01:54.759 that's my seven-year-old son you and
00:01:55.840 he's like put him on the phone
00:02:01.000 and I'm just anxious for him to get this
00:02:02.719 statement out because in my mind it's
00:02:04.000 not final until the statement is
00:02:05.560 actually out and he he he talks to my
00:02:08.479 son and and he reads the statement that
00:02:11.080 he is going to put out on Truth social
00:02:13.080 announcing that I'm the VP nominee of
00:02:15.239 the Republican party and he's like what
00:02:16.480 do you think about that Yuan and my son
00:02:18.080 y's like oh that's that that's pretty
00:02:19.599 good that's pretty good he gives the
00:02:22.040 phone back to me he's like I have no
00:02:23.280 idea what the hell is going on he
00:02:24.840 doesn't that means he has no idea and
00:02:27.400 and of course I remember this story
00:02:29.519 because
00:02:30.440 because in particular and the Madison
00:02:33.080 Square Garden rally of a few days ago
00:02:35.640 was the first time that my son actually
00:02:37.519 met Donald Trump so he'd spoken to him
00:02:39.360 on the phone but hadn't actually met him
00:02:40.760 until the rally at MSG and my
00:02:43.440 seven-year-old really wanted to tell him
00:02:44.959 a joke and he remembers this phone
00:02:47.159 conversation and so he tells him this
00:02:49.239 joke and Trump kind of Chuckles but also
00:02:51.760 is probably judging me because it was
00:02:53.120 somewhat inappropriate joke for a
00:02:54.400 seven-year-old to tell but yeah here we
00:02:56.280 are well that's the only ones
00:02:58.800 seven-year-olds remember
00:03:01.280 that's right well it's like you know I
00:03:03.680 have a I have terrible language it's
00:03:05.440 it's one of my my many flaws but I was
00:03:07.239 raised by my very workingclass
00:03:09.360 grandmother and she was actually very
00:03:11.200 interestingly she was a very devout
00:03:12.959 Christian but she also had you know a
00:03:15.560 language that would make a sailor blush
00:03:17.560 and so I talk like that because I was
00:03:18.879 raised by this woman those are fun
00:03:20.920 ladies those are fun ladies and she was
00:03:22.480 a great she was she was awesome uh she
00:03:25.519 had an amazing she's an amazing person a
00:03:27.480 huge personality right we called her a
00:03:29.080 force of nature because she was such
00:03:30.560 this this big personality but my wife's
00:03:33.200 rule is you know basically he's only
00:03:35.560 allowed to cuss when he's telling this
00:03:37.159 one joke so oh that's hilarious he
00:03:40.799 told exactly he says it 14 times a day
00:03:44.439 yeah I early on I told my kids you can
00:03:47.560 swear in front of us like go but don't
00:03:50.000 just don't swear in front of other
00:03:51.159 parents and don't swear for no reason
00:03:53.200 right well because they judge you right
00:03:54.360 the other parents judge you how old are
00:03:55.439 your kids well the the youngest ones are
00:03:57.040 14 and 16 and I have a 28-year-old but
00:03:59.159 when my uh 14-year-old was two we were
00:04:02.200 on a skiing trip and uh we we were about
00:04:05.120 to leave we packed up all our stuff but
00:04:08.000 her helmet we forgot to put her helmet
00:04:09.519 away I go ah we forgot to put the helmet
00:04:11.319 away and she just looks down at the
00:04:12.400 helmet and she goes
00:04:16.358 [ __ ] and me and my wife is just like oh
00:04:19.040 my God it was so funny there's just
00:04:22.240 something adorable about a 2-year-old
00:04:24.400 that doesn't know that you're not
00:04:25.400 supposed to say [ __ ] just that cute
00:04:27.639 little face well I mean my my uh my
00:04:30.960 four-year-old he was three at the time
00:04:33.240 we were going cuz you know we live in
00:04:34.960 Cincinnati but then I'm a senator so we
00:04:36.600 spent a lot of time in Washington and I
00:04:38.080 was taking my four-year-old solo he was
00:04:40.120 three at the time on this trip and we're
00:04:42.199 on like a Delta flight we're in the back
00:04:44.160 I'm kind of wondering cuz you know I've
00:04:45.960 got bed head and I'm thinking to myself
00:04:47.680 do any of these people know that I'm a
00:04:48.919 senator cuz I look like [ __ ] right now
00:04:51.240 and my sort of geta away with it I don't
00:04:53.960 think that anybody notices who I am and
00:04:56.080 we're sitting there and my son drops one
00:04:58.919 of those bis cof cookies in between the
00:05:01.360 the seat and he looks at me and he says
00:05:03.479 Dad well
00:05:07.240 [ __ ] and like 12 people instantly turn
00:05:11.800 around and look at me it's like oh
00:05:13.080 Senator Vance your son has such colorful
00:05:14.639 language I'm like oh my God I'm such a
00:05:16.400 terrible father and these people are all
00:05:17.880 judging me yeah but it's you know but
00:05:21.520 you're right it's so cute Ador yeah it's
00:05:24.360 it's so funny but yeah I got to do a
00:05:26.440 little bit better about that because
00:05:27.720 they're going to start judging me people
00:05:28.960 need to relax
00:05:31.160 little bad words every now and then it's
00:05:33.199 good for you I think it's good for you I
00:05:35.240 gets a little steam out I agree it's
00:05:37.000 good do did was there any part of you
00:05:39.520 that was like do I really want this job
00:05:42.720 because it comes with so much it comes
00:05:44.720 with not having the Secret Service in
00:05:46.280 the room it comes with this enormous
00:05:48.360 change of your life this insane
00:05:51.400 responsibility you everybody's watched
00:05:53.919 presidents especially age radically
00:05:56.880 dramatically yeah and everyone but Trump
00:06:00.759 kind of amazing yeah the dude just
00:06:03.120 didn't age it's so strange it's like it
00:06:05.840 barely affected him everybody else is

00:08:47.279 really is amazing I mean one of the
00:08:48.519 first times that I I sort of spent like
00:08:50.720 a large amount of time with Trump was in
00:08:52.480 2021 and I was thinking about running
00:08:54.399 for the Senate so I was down in Mar Lago
00:08:55.959 talking to him and my initial reaction
00:08:57.839 on seeing him was like oh my God God you
00:09:00.040 look really good you actually look
00:09:01.800 healthier now than you did 6 years ago
00:09:04.360 normally president's age very very badly
00:09:08.440 you know yeah I mean look I I I
00:09:09.839 definitely thought okay obviously this
00:09:11.360 is a big it's a big thing right and my
00:09:13.160 you know talked about it with my wife a
00:09:14.320 lot because she's like a she was a
00:09:16.079 working corporate litigator she's got a
00:09:17.600 very big career she's much smarter than
00:09:19.760 I am and we definitely it was a marital
00:09:22.000 conversation some ways a tough one
00:09:23.720 because you know even though yeah I'm a
00:09:25.720 senator we're still pretty Anonymous
00:09:28.160 right like we can go on vacation or we
00:09:29.800 were till this happened we go on
00:09:31.680 vacation yeah you'd have people stop and
00:09:33.680 ask take a photo or say something you
00:09:35.360 know nice but most most people if you
00:09:38.120 went somewhere didn't know who you were
00:09:39.720 right now it's it's literally impossible
00:09:41.760 for us to go anywhere what's that shift
00:09:43.600 feel like like you're 40 years old right
00:09:46.480 so yeah I I mean like right like this
00:09:48.959 just off a cliff complete different life
00:09:51.760 yeah that's right that's right I mean
00:09:53.279 it's it's it's been I mean look in some
00:09:55.440 ways it's really nice because people
00:09:57.519 come up and say really nice things to
00:09:58.800 you they tell you you're they're praying
00:10:00.320 for your kids they're praying for for
00:10:01.720 your
00:10:02.720 family doesn't it like if you go through
00:10:05.120 yeah no of course yeah um uh through
00:10:07.760 like the super woke blue haired parts of
00:10:10.079 Brooklyn you know it's interesting when
00:10:11.000 we were in New York for the MSG rally a
00:10:12.720 few people saw me and flashed the
00:10:14.240 universal New York sign for we're number
00:10:16.360 one right so you know they like us even
00:10:18.720 New York City but it it's it's
00:10:21.720 definitely weird to just not be
00:10:23.079 anonymous at all anymore right and
00:10:25.680 that's taken some getting used to I I
00:10:27.320 think part of it is also so let me just
00:10:29.959 give an example so Sunday morning we
00:10:31.279 want to go for this is the this is the
00:10:32.920 event Madison Square Garden we had the
00:10:34.880 morning where I didn't really have
00:10:35.880 anything going on had a couple phone
00:10:37.040 calls so we want to go for a walk with
00:10:39.240 the kids in Central Park and normally
00:10:42.600 you would walk out of your hotel and
00:10:44.279 walk into Central Park and hang out with
00:10:45.639 your family now what requires we have to
00:10:47.480 notify Secret Service and so then they
00:10:49.480 have to scope out an area where they can
00:10:51.600 make sure that it's going to be properly
00:10:53.000 safe and so instead of walking out our
00:10:54.720 hotel room and taking a walk in Central
00:10:56.279 Park we hop in a car and show up in some
00:10:59.320 in a part of Central Park that's 20
00:11:00.720 blocks away and then of course as soon
00:11:02.800 as we get out everybody's like well who
00:11:04.240 the hell is this because there are 14
00:11:05.839 car motorcade there so the lack of
00:11:07.880 anonymity is definitely an annoyance
00:11:09.839 that comes along with it but I I mean I
00:11:12.600 I I'm the kind of person where you just
00:11:14.519 take the good with the bad there are a
00:11:16.279 lot of benefits to it there are some
00:11:17.680 downsides to it it's what I ask for I
00:11:19.639 try not to think too much about it or
00:11:21.160 complain too much about it I just try to
00:11:23.320 accept it I think obviously if we win
00:11:24.880 which you know 6 days from now I think
00:11:26.360 we are going to win I think we'll have
00:11:27.880 to sort of get into more of a routine
00:11:29.959 with it my attitude thus far has been
00:11:31.560 well it's only for a few months so you
00:11:32.839 can do anything for a few months is the
00:11:34.959 adjustment um is it like is it difficult
00:11:39.760 was it pretty easy did you just accept
00:11:41.560 it like this is how life is now well
00:11:44.440 it's you just you have to accept it but
00:11:46.320 it's not easy right I mean in particular
00:11:48.360 for our kids right like okay I really
00:11:50.279 like to drive and 99% of the time that
00:11:53.720 if we're as a in the car as a family I'm
00:11:56.760 driving my wife's in the passenger seat
00:11:58.320 just cuz I like to drive
00:11:59.839 and I think for our kids getting used to
00:12:02.240 oh we're not going into our car we're
00:12:03.720 going into this black SUV and daddy's
00:12:06.120 not driving right there's some other
00:12:08.079 person there they don't know right yeah
00:12:10.279 or you know like one of the first things
00:12:11.920 that happened we're back at our house in
00:12:13.399 Cincinnati the the weekend after the RNC
00:12:16.240 convention and we're sitting there
00:12:18.240 watching like some stupid show Emily and
00:12:20.560 Paris on Netflix or something which
00:12:22.120 sorry I don't mean to call that a stupid
00:12:23.360 show I actually think Emily and Paris is
00:12:24.639 a masterpiece but set that to the side
00:12:26.800 bracket that one for now um but watching
00:12:29.440 some Show on Netflix and you know you
00:12:31.560 just you see one guy walk past your your
00:12:33.600 window and you see another guy walk past
00:12:35.160 your window and it's just a secret
00:12:36.600 service agent patrolling just little
00:12:38.560 things like that so you know it just you
00:12:41.680 recognize that your zone of privacy is
00:12:43.560 very narrow and that takes some
00:12:45.720 adjusting and getting used to and you
00:12:48.959 know there are all of these these small
00:12:51.040 little adjustments but by and large
00:12:53.160 honestly like I love our secret service
00:12:54.639 detail our kids are really into them
00:12:57.120 they sort of see them as their their
00:12:58.360 police protectors our seven-year-old
00:13:00.279 it's funny you know he's in second grade
00:13:03.320 and one of his buddies their their
00:13:05.760 parents came to us and said do you know
00:13:07.399 that the kids are playing this game in
00:13:08.880 school called uh called boss man where
00:13:13.160 basically one second grader will walk
00:13:15.399 down the hallway or on down the
00:13:17.040 playground flanked by two separate
00:13:18.839 second graders like they're playing
00:13:21.360 secret service now playing secret
00:13:22.760 service now school so like on the one
00:13:26.079 hand that's really bizarre and I hope
00:13:27.800 that it doesn't permanently screw up the
00:13:29.519 psychological development of my kid on
00:13:31.440 the other hand it's kind of funny and
00:13:33.120 you just go with the flow and you try to
00:13:34.720 work with it yeah I guess they're just
00:13:38.000 making fun with it yeah is like did you
00:13:42.040 have presidential aspirations before all
00:13:45.360 this is this something that you had
00:13:46.880 considered about the future was it like
00:13:49.680 how how did you approach this yeah I
00:13:51.399 mean you it's it's one of these things
00:13:52.680 when you're elected to the Senate and
00:13:54.560 you know I'm a pretty young guy I think
00:13:55.800 it was I'm the second youngest United
00:13:58.000 States Senator right now you certainly
00:13:59.920 think like is this something I might do
00:14:01.199 in the future what does this look like
00:14:02.920 what would you need to do in terms of
00:14:04.360 getting your family in in the right
00:14:05.720 mental space and just making it happen
00:14:08.120 but it's all very abstract right it's
00:14:09.800 it's not all that different from you
00:14:12.000 know 10 years ago thinking about
00:14:13.839 starting a business that I never started
00:14:15.519 right it's just things you think about
00:14:17.199 but you never really think that hard
00:14:19.199 about right and that's kind of that was
00:14:21.519 kind of my attitude towards it I I
00:14:23.079 started to realize that Trump was
00:14:24.759 thinking pretty seriously about making
00:14:27.320 me his VP nominee probably earlier this
00:14:30.680 year because he would ask me a lot about
00:14:32.959 who I thought the VP nominee should be
00:14:34.880 oh boy and i' you know exactly and i'
00:14:38.040 give
00:14:38.680 him and I'd give him names of people
00:14:40.759 that I thought would be pretty good at
00:14:41.880 it and a lot of the names that I gave
00:14:43.680 him he would he would criticize and I
00:14:45.320 almost felt like he was inviting me to
00:14:47.600 throw myself out there but the I mean
00:14:51.839 it's
00:14:52.839 funny the morning that he was shot in in
00:14:56.680 uh Butler PA was the first time that he
00:14:58.240 and I ever talked about it it so that
00:15:00.560 was a Saturday just think thinking about
00:15:02.600 I guess it was probably June 13th cuz I
00:15:04.720 think the convention started June 15th I
00:15:07.240 go down to Mar Lago that morning
00:15:08.839 Saturday morning and I'm talking to him
00:15:10.920 for the first time because the media
00:15:12.240 always ask me I was like one of the
00:15:13.560 rumored shortless candidates I kept on
00:15:15.240 getting these questions from reporters
00:15:17.120 have you ever been have you ever had
00:15:18.480 this conversation with Trump and the
00:15:19.480 honest answer was no well Saturday
00:15:21.199 morning that changed because I go down
00:15:22.480 there and he's like what you know what
00:15:23.600 do you think why why why should I choose
00:15:25.680 you um why should I not choose these
00:15:27.800 other guys like we just had
00:15:29.600 was in the running you know I don't
00:15:31.240 really know actually I I really don't
00:15:33.440 know come on man look I I I I I think I
00:15:36.680 think that there were a couple of
00:15:37.959 senators that were being considered a
00:15:39.160 couple of Governors a couple of former
00:15:40.639 cabinet secretaries but you don't really
00:15:42.600 know because when Donald Trump sat me
00:15:44.279 down I mean he talked about 10 different
00:15:45.600 people that he was thinking about naming
00:15:47.199 and this was two days before he made the
00:15:48.639 selection so he's playing like a little
00:15:50.560 like let's see how JD thinks game yeah I
00:15:53.240 think so and you know he he told me that
00:15:56.839 the he was talking to the gardener at
00:15:58.560 Mar about who the who the Vice
00:16:00.560 Presidential nominee should be and
00:16:02.240 that's one of I think Trump's sort of
00:16:03.880 political Geniuses is he talks to
00:16:05.440 everybody about everything and I was
00:16:08.279 like well what the what the Garder at
00:16:09.800 Margo have to say about this
00:16:11.199 conversation because this really
00:16:13.160 directly in impacts my life and you know
00:16:16.480 he he basically said well I think I'm
00:16:18.839 probably going to pick you but I don't
00:16:20.800 know and I'm not ready to make a
00:16:22.120 decision and then he looks at one of his
00:16:24.519 staff members who's in the room he's
00:16:25.519 like actually wouldn't it really set the
00:16:27.639 world a blaze if we just made the
00:16:29.160 decision today and so why don't you come
00:16:31.319 up with me and we'll just do the
00:16:33.040 announcement in Butler Pennsylvania well
00:16:35.720 and and I said and of course not knowing
00:16:37.639 at the time what was going to happen I
00:16:38.959 was like absolutely let's get this over
00:16:40.880 with because I'm sick of not knowing
00:16:42.480 let's just get this thing over with and
00:16:44.199 then he's like ah no I'm not going to
00:16:45.399 I'm not going to do it up there we need
00:16:46.600 to prepare for it better so look I'm not
00:16:48.800 saying it's going to be you but I'm
00:16:50.360 thinking very seriously about it have
00:16:52.000 fun we'll see after Butler PA and then
00:16:53.759 of course I go back to home to Ohio oh
00:16:55.519 boy he gets shot you know the initial
00:16:57.839 reaction is I actually thought they had
00:16:59.800 killed him because when you first see
00:17:01.440 the video he grabs his ear and then he
00:17:03.399 goes down and I'm like oh my God they
00:17:06.319 just killed him and I was so I mean
00:17:08.880 first I was so pissed but then I go into
00:17:11.439 like fight ORF flight mode with my kids
00:17:13.480 I'm like you know all right kids you
00:17:15.319 know we were at a we were at a mini golf
00:17:17.679 place in Cincinnati Ohio I grab my kids
00:17:19.799 up throw them in the car go home and
00:17:21.799 load all my guns and basically stand
00:17:24.240 like a centry in our front door oh [ __ ]
00:17:27.079 and that was my that was sort of my
00:17:29.000 action to it anyway I really didn't know
00:17:32.080 it was going to happen until Monday
00:17:33.240 morning I didn't know who else was being
00:17:35.000 selected I think it was all the names
00:17:36.760 that people sort of see out there right
00:17:38.520 all good guys like nobody I have any any
00:17:40.480 personal animosity towards but obviously
00:17:44.000 you know here we are how much did you
00:17:46.880 study the story of the Assassin the
00:17:50.280 attempted assassin how much have you
00:17:52.160 paid attention to you know what Crooks
00:17:53.640 or cooks or whatever the guy's name is
00:17:55.039 in Pennsylvania I mean I've read a fair
00:17:56.760 amount about it and it's pretty bizarre
00:17:58.880 it's very bizarre it's bizarre they
00:18:00.760 haven't been able to get into his phone
00:18:03.120 well they got they got into his phone um
00:18:05.720 didn't they have they I I I thought
00:18:07.440 they've I thought they said they did
00:18:09.440 maybe you know better than me well maybe
00:18:10.840 they got into his phone but they
00:18:11.960 couldn't access his encrypted messages
00:18:13.480 or something I I I thought there was
00:18:14.799 some deal where they they haven't really
00:18:16.280 gotten his communication yet yeah I
00:18:19.400 maybe haven't read it as closely as you
00:18:21.360 have so don't take that as gospel
00:18:23.080 probably you have access to more
00:18:24.520 information but maybe you can't talk
00:18:25.960 about it no TR trust me there's nothing
00:18:28.320 about this that I have access in
00:18:29.640 information I can't talk about well
00:18:30.880 there was a lot of weird stuff to it one
00:18:32.480 of them is that his uh where he lived
00:18:34.760 was professionally scrubbed so they got
00:18:37.320 there there was no silverware there's no
00:18:39.360 silverware place scrubbed right yeah
00:18:42.200 there's nothing there's no no DNA no
00:18:45.480 hard drives no nothing and how do you
00:18:48.440 get that close I mean you know do you
00:18:50.840 shoot guns yeah okay so I'm a pretty
00:18:53.559 good shot I served in the ring Corps for
00:18:54.919 four years uh an AR-15 from 140 yards
00:18:58.400 away
00:18:59.440 is a shot even without a scope he didn't
00:19:02.039 have a scope right I don't believe he
00:19:03.600 had a scope without without a scope I've
00:19:06.080 shot an I've shot a M16 many times and
00:19:08.440 an AR15 without a scope there is no it
00:19:12.240 is shocking that he's alive it really it
00:19:14.480 really is I I mean I you know I'm I'm a
00:19:16.559 person of Faith but I I think it's a
00:19:17.880 genuine miracle that that guy didn't
00:19:20.240 kill him but how did he get so close
00:19:23.240 there's a lot of really big questions he
00:19:25.880 was walking around the area with a
00:19:27.400 rangefinder
00:19:29.000 before the event and people were yelling
00:19:31.640 and saying this got a gun he's on the
00:19:33.960 roof yeah you know there was that crazy
00:19:36.200 I think it was a BBC reporter somebody
00:19:37.960 with an English accent who did the
00:19:39.400 report on the ground with the guy you
00:19:42.960 know he's he's like got a Maga hat on
00:19:44.840 and a Bud Light he's you're probably not
00:19:46.760 a Bud Light he's got some beer and he's
00:19:48.760 talking to this guy who saw Crooks get
00:19:52.440 on the roof and he's yelling at him it's
00:19:54.760 an amazing clip he's yelling at him like
00:19:56.799 Hey he's yelling at police officers
00:19:58.720 saying hey this guy's on the roof go and
00:20:00.600 get him and nobody responded to it and
00:20:05.120 it's the whole thing is very fishy to me
00:20:07.080 and I hope that we win and then get to
00:20:09.159 the bottom of it cuz I think somebody
00:20:10.320 clearly screwed up not it doesn't seem
00:20:12.679 like just screwed up like the the excuse
00:20:15.960 that the lady from the Secret Service
00:20:17.480 had that they couldn't put snipers on
00:20:19.000 the roof cuz the roof was
00:20:20.640 sloped like all of it is bananas the
00:20:23.840 whole that's ridiculous that's
00:20:25.880 ridiculous and the the miracle is Trump
00:20:29.159 turns his head at the last second at the
00:20:31.400 very last second he turns his head to
00:20:32.720 look at the chart and the bullet just
00:20:34.120 grazes his ear that's right he's got a
00:20:36.280 people keep there's this stupid
00:20:37.919 conspiracy out there he's got a mark on
00:20:39.840 his ear I saw it he has a mark on his
00:20:43.640 ear and people like why isn't there a
00:20:45.280 hole in his ear because it's just the
00:20:47.039 edge of the skin got hit that's all it
00:20:49.320 was that's right it's the luckiest of
00:20:51.960 luckiest shots ever for him
00:20:54.280 unfortunately not for the people that
00:20:55.400 were behind him cuz a couple of people
00:20:57.240 got shot and for anybody that thinks
00:20:59.720 that that was staged you don't
00:21:02.559 understand shooting there's no way you
00:21:04.760 can graze someone's ear from 120 y you
00:21:08.200 can hit them Center Mass you're not
00:21:10.320 going to be able to graze their ear you
00:21:11.799 could kill them easily accidentally if
00:21:14.039 you were faking something like that well
00:21:15.400 we've all seen the graphics right of him
00:21:17.320 turning his head and if he hadn't turned
00:21:19.159 his head that it would have went right
00:21:20.279 through his brain and there was another
00:21:22.080 one that went to the left side of him
00:21:23.760 right that barely that barely missed him
00:21:25.400 yeah that barely missed him and then
00:21:27.720 instantly that guy is dead and then they
00:21:30.320 take a hold of his body he's cremated 10
00:21:32.360 days
00:21:33.400 later there's no press conference
00:21:36.240 there's no toxicology report no one
00:21:39.679 talks about it on the news right and
00:21:41.279 when there's a school shooter we usually
00:21:43.400 have the person's Manifesto out there a
00:21:45.679 day or two later we know nothing about
00:21:47.919 the motive here which I think is the
00:21:49.279 craziest thing you know I'm obviously
00:21:51.600 he's motivated because he hates Donald
00:21:53.200 Trump but you don't know anything about
00:21:54.440 the secondary motive I man it is weird
00:21:57.760 it is really we don't get a Manifesto is
00:21:59.799 when they're trans when they're trans
00:22:01.559 they hide those manifestos the N that
00:22:03.559 that the Nashville shooter man that was
00:22:05.679 crazy have you read any of it I've read
00:22:07.760 some of it and pretty wild it's pretty
00:22:09.640 wild and yeah I mean that guy and they
00:22:11.640 decide that's bad for the cause so they
00:22:13.679 decided and they they decided to
00:22:15.240 suppress it but no the Nashville shooter
00:22:17.440 I mean just while we're on the topic
00:22:19.000 went in and murdered a bunch of children
00:22:20.880 at a Christian school because he or she
00:22:24.520 like whatever was motivated by some very
00:22:27.320 radical trans IDE ology and that is
00:22:30.799 something we should talk more about as a
00:22:32.320 country 100% And they didn't want if if
00:22:35.159 there's any other ideology that led
00:22:37.679 someone to mass murder you would examine
00:22:40.120 that ideology very carefully it was some
00:22:42.000 sort of radical religion people would be
00:22:43.799 like very concerned about that radical
00:22:45.360 religion that's right and it is it's
00:22:47.120 radical religion of War exactly what it
00:22:48.520 is it's this weird idea that you are so
00:22:51.640 virtuous and so correct you're allowed
00:22:53.200 to commit violence against these other
00:22:54.919 people because they're the oppressors
00:22:56.159 even though they're children well you
00:22:57.440 know these these signs that are in super
00:22:59.520 woke neighborhoods I'm sure there's
00:23:00.559 plenty of them in Austin like in this
00:23:02.240 house we believe science is real no
00:23:05.120 person is you know what I'm talking
00:23:06.240 about okay so I don't know your
00:23:07.640 religious background but like I'm I'm a
00:23:09.200 convert to Catholicism it's like was
00:23:11.279 raised Christian became an atheist came
00:23:13.480 back to Christianity got baptized
00:23:15.320 Catholic like five or six years ago um
00:23:18.159 and what is so interesting about this in
00:23:20.880 this house we believe is it's so similar
00:23:24.000 to the Creed that you declare every day
00:23:28.120 at a Catholic mass right we believe in
00:23:31.320 one Lord Jesus Christ the only begotten
00:23:33.320 Son of God and there's almost a similar
00:23:35.760 Cadence between the the Christian Creed
00:23:39.840 and what these these guys are doing with
00:23:41.760 this hyper woke stuff and then there's
00:23:43.919 the rallies and then there's of course
00:23:45.679 the various rituals and it absolutely is
00:23:48.480 a religious Faith there was this really
00:23:50.840 interesting post that was um you know I
00:23:54.200 forget exactly who wrote it but the
00:23:57.080 title was gay rights
00:24:01.200 as what was it um it was like gay rights
00:24:05.440 as religious rights but the second
00:24:08.640 Rights was r i
00:24:11.120 Tes and it was a guy who was like a pro
00:24:13.559 gay rights guy but sort of made the
00:24:15.679 observation that when you get into the
00:24:17.400 really radical trans stuff you actually
00:24:20.200 start to notice the similarities between
00:24:22.760 a practiced religious faith and what
00:24:26.000 these guys are doing yeah and it's it's
00:24:28.399 very interesting I actually met earlier
00:24:29.840 with a friend who lives in Austin who's
00:24:31.159 like a you know kind of a gay Reagan
00:24:33.039 Democrat and he's he's very very
00:24:36.000 interesting guy is is a fascinating guy
00:24:37.960 he's one of the smartest political
00:24:39.399 philosophers I think how do you be a gay
00:24:41.320 Reagan Democrat I you know I I don't
00:24:43.679 know um it's just kind ofan Democrat I
00:24:47.279 mean he's he's basically like now what
00:24:48.960 you would call a trump Republican but
00:24:50.480 he's a political philosopher and he
00:24:51.760 writes about economics right that's sort
00:24:53.240 of how I got connected to him I had no
00:24:54.640 idea he was gay when I first met him but
00:24:57.159 you know he I I'll never forget he sent
00:25:00.039 me something like six or so years ago
00:25:03.000 and it was Elizabeth Warren when she was
00:25:04.520 running for president and she was like
00:25:07.480 we stand for all non-binary to Spirit
00:25:11.080 and all of the all of the like lgbti
00:25:14.600 plus she was talking about all the plus
00:25:16.720 and she was cying it and he sent me this
00:25:19.240 this text message with this Elizabeth
00:25:21.200 Warren tweet and he's like I don't know
00:25:22.880 what the hell to Spirit is we just
00:25:24.240 wanted to be left the hell
00:25:26.320 alone and I I think that frankly I
00:25:29.360 wouldn't be surprised if me and Trump
00:25:31.360 won just the normal gay guy vote because
00:25:35.679 again they just wanted to be left the
00:25:37.000 hell alone and now you have all this
00:25:38.640 crazy stuff on top of it that they're
00:25:40.080 like well no no no we didn't we we
00:25:41.600 didn't want to give pharmaceutical
00:25:43.039 products to 9-year-olds who are
00:25:44.559 transitioning their genders we just
00:25:46.360 wanted to be left the hell alone well a
00:25:47.960 lot of gay guys feel like the whole
00:25:49.799 movement is homophobic which is ironic
00:25:52.399 cuz they think there they think that
00:25:53.919 there's people think there's something
00:25:55.120 wrong with being gay so what you really
00:25:56.799 are is a girl yes and they think that a
00:25:59.399 lot of this is being given these
00:26:01.480 thoughts are being given to gay kids
00:26:03.840 these kids would just grow up to be gay
00:26:05.399 men and instead you're getting them to
00:26:07.640 convert their gender it's pharmaceutical
00:26:09.360 conversion therapy right and it's
00:26:11.120 profitable which is terrifying it's
00:26:13.039 terrifying once corporations once
00:26:15.760 pharmaceutical corporations have uh they
00:26:18.640 they have a pattern in a history of
00:26:21.039 profiting off of things they want to
00:26:22.799 keep profiting off of it they don't want
00:26:24.240 to just stop and so right now this has
00:26:26.399 become a profitable Venture that scaled
00:26:29.000 if you go look back from like 2007 to
00:26:31.080 2024 there's way more of these air
00:26:33.640 quotes gender affirming Care Centers and
00:26:36.159 they're profitable well and this used to
00:26:37.880 be something that the old left right the
00:26:39.960 criticism that was made of American
00:26:41.679 Healthcare which I always thought made
00:26:43.520 some sense as a conservative guy is that
00:26:45.799 when you have the profit motive
00:26:48.279 influencing government policy around
00:26:50.679 Healthcare then yeah okay sometimes the
00:26:53.080 profit motive can be a good thing like
00:26:54.679 we're going to develop life-saving
00:26:56.000 cancer drugs we want that to happen
00:26:57.679 right and I'm with people making a big
00:26:59.159 profit for that but then sometimes
00:27:01.039 they'll try to manipulate government
00:27:02.919 policy to make their own drugs more
00:27:06.000 profitable not because it's good for
00:27:07.559 health but because these people just
00:27:08.960 naturally like most people want to make
00:27:10.360 some money yeah and that conversation
00:27:13.679 has totally disappeared like I got into
00:27:16.440 a big argument and you know this person
00:27:19.559 you can read about the New York Times
00:27:21.200 later disavowed our friendship and
00:27:23.720 leaked our text messages to the New York
00:27:25.640 Times but the breaking point was I came
00:27:28.320 out against this gender transition for
00:27:30.320 minors when I was running for the Senate
00:27:32.480 a few years ago and she's a transgender
00:27:34.840 individual and she kind of flipped out
00:27:36.399 on me and I I I the thing that I never
00:27:39.080 understood CU she's like very much an
00:27:40.480 old school leftist is are you not at all
00:27:43.120 a little bit worried about how rich
00:27:45.880 people are getting by prescribing
00:27:48.679 experimental Therapeutics to 9 10
00:27:50.880 12-year-old kids like this used to be
00:27:53.399 something that the American left would
00:27:55.000 have gone crazy about and now the PE the
00:27:58.760 only people who are raising concerns
00:28:00.200 about it are conservative Republicans
00:28:02.559 but we should be concerned when because
00:28:04.960 it's not just like the lobbying and the
00:28:07.559 influence I mean there there's something
00:28:09.440 called the diagnostic statistical manual
00:28:11.480 it's sort of the the manual of
00:28:13.159 psychiatric disorders and I think that
00:28:14.799 we're on the DSM 5 as it's called which
00:28:17.760 is the fifth edition of this manual you
00:28:20.519 have drug companies that are making
00:28:23.000 money that are lobbying to have you know
00:28:26.919 child dysphoria
00:28:28.679 put into our psychiatric manuals because
00:28:31.279 then psychiatrists will treat that
00:28:33.679 condition and then those pharmaceutical
00:28:35.440 companies will get rich from it somebody
00:28:37.600 should be interrogating whether the
00:28:39.399 political incentives of our country
00:28:41.679 actually align with the financial
00:28:44.159 incentives of the pharmaceutical
00:28:46.039 industry because often times the answer
00:28:47.559 is going to be no but nobody's asking
00:28:49.440 that question well we've always known
00:28:51.760 that children are very easily influenced
00:28:54.279 and that children shouldn't be allowed
00:28:55.720 to make life-changing decisions when
00:28:57.240 they're very young that's why they can't
00:28:58.519 get tattooed absolutely we've always
00:29:00.799 known that and then all of a sudden
00:29:02.200 because of gender that's abandoned we've
00:29:05.159 completely changed the way we think that
00:29:06.840 children oh they just know I've had
00:29:09.519 mind-numbing conversations with people
00:29:11.360 who believe that and it all falls apart
00:29:14.159 if you just keep asking questions just
00:29:16.600 ask them to Define how can you know this
00:29:19.559 what about the development of the
00:29:21.480 frontal loob what about this
00:29:24.279 understanding that children have never
00:29:25.880 been able to make life-changing
00:29:27.200 decisions you don't allow them to drink
00:29:29.360 alcohol you don't allow them to get
00:29:30.799 tattooed they can't join the military
00:29:32.399 when they're 10 like there there's a lot
00:29:34.320 of [ __ ] you can't do when you're a
00:29:35.159 little kid why are you letting them just
00:29:36.720 change their gender what does this even
00:29:38.519 mean and then the New York Times thing
00:29:40.960 that comes out where it shows that they
00:29:42.840 had a whole study about these puberty
00:29:45.640 blockers that showed that they do not
00:29:47.919 help the children's mental health and
00:29:50.039 that they probably have a lot of
00:29:51.760 horrific side effects and so they
00:29:53.720 decided not to release they de not to
00:29:55.120 publish that right which shows you the
00:29:57.320 corruption of science is that we're
00:29:59.320 actually not publishing studies that
00:30:01.240 suggest the gender transition craziness
00:30:03.640 has reached the boiling boiling point I
00:30:06.200 mean you know you have you've had you
00:30:08.399 you have kids I have a four-year-old and
00:30:09.880 a 2-year-old every single day my
00:30:11.960 four-year-old or 2-year-old will come to
00:30:13.480 me and say something that is batshit
00:30:16.039 insane because they're four and two like
00:30:18.720 my four-year-old will come and say Daddy
00:30:20.440 I'm a dinosaur right I'm going to take
00:30:22.679 him to like the dinosaur transition
00:30:24.440 clinic and put scales on them and the
00:30:26.600 thing is this czy ing them and some
00:30:29.559 parents it's just the I'm just going to
00:30:32.279 say it even though it sounds gross they
00:30:34.320 want their kid to be a part of the lgbtq
00:30:37.840 thing because it looks like a flag of
00:30:40.240 virtue that they can post in their front
00:30:41.960 long oh look we have a queer child like
00:30:44.760 oh you're amazing there's a weird thing
00:30:47.320 about it with some of these nutty
00:30:48.720 parents where you could imagine them in
00:30:52.159 there there has to be some reason why
00:30:54.200 this enormous percentage of Hollywood
00:30:56.279 kids are trans like how many celebrities
00:30:59.399 have trans kids it's new it's not a
00:31:02.159 thing that was going on just a few it
00:31:03.799 was rare in the past right it becomes a
00:31:06.240 social signifier for a lot of parents
00:31:09.080 and we have to be honest about that fact
00:31:10.639 and if you look at you know look at
00:31:12.399 where the gender craziness is the most
00:31:15.399 common it's most common among upper
00:31:18.279 middle class to lower middle class white
00:31:22.279 progressives now you could believe okay
00:31:24.480 that there's just like something genetic
00:31:26.080 going on in the mind of a wealthy white
00:31:28.320 Progressive or you could believe that
00:31:30.960 this is a cultural Trend that we should
00:31:33.120 be questioning a lot more than we are
00:31:35.080 right now and
00:31:36.880 unfortunately I mean here's one thing
00:31:39.440 that I really worry about is
00:31:42.120 okay think about the incentives people
00:31:44.200 are very good at rationalizing things if
00:31:46.519 you are a you know middle class or upper
00:31:50.919 middle class white parent and the only
00:31:54.240 thing that you care about is whether
00:31:55.799 your child goes into Harvard or Yale
00:31:58.480 like obviously that pathway has become a
00:32:00.679 lot harder for a lot of upper middle
00:32:03.279 class kids but the one way that those
00:32:07.000 people can participate in the Dei
00:32:09.399 bureaucracy in this country is to be
00:32:13.039 trans and is there a dynamic that's
00:32:15.600 going on where if you become trans that
00:32:20.200 is the way to reject your white
00:32:22.279 privilege right that's the social
00:32:24.159 signifier the only one that's available
00:32:26.720 in the hyper woke mindset is if you
00:32:30.559 become gender non-binary nonbinary is
00:32:33.679 the best one because you don't even have
00:32:35.320 to do anything you just say I'm not I
00:32:37.320 could say I'm non-binary and like you
00:32:39.080 don't have to do anything but all of a
00:32:40.200 sudden you're a part of the group yeah
00:32:41.399 well that's right and and again I I
00:32:42.960 think it's important to sort of you know
00:32:45.000 most people are not saying oh I'm white
00:32:48.039 privileged how do I become part of the
00:32:50.799 privilege set but it's these weird ways
00:32:53.240 in which these ideas creep in to the
00:32:55.240 mind to to the mainstream and people are
00:32:57.279 very good at rationalizing these things
00:32:59.039 and so what I think 20 30 years ago even
00:33:01.240 among very well-to-do white progressives
00:33:04.120 like an 11-year-old says I think
00:33:06.080 11-year-old boy says I think that I'm a
00:33:07.679 girl most of the time we would have said
00:33:10.000 oh that's ridiculous and crazy and you
00:33:12.639 know haaha and come back to me in a
00:33:15.159 couple of days now I think there is this
00:33:18.000 massive incentive to try to say oh my
00:33:20.120 God is does that mean that my kid is
00:33:22.559 trans and I also think it's to your
00:33:24.600 point very warping on the minds of young
00:33:27.159 kids because what they're now doing is
00:33:29.760 taking normal adolescent curiosity and
00:33:33.559 normal adolescent discomfort like I
00:33:35.480 don't know a single person who went from
00:33:37.120 the ages of 10 to 15 who didn't say oh
00:33:40.559 like sometimes I had some you know weird
00:33:43.159 ideas or I dressed weird for a couple of
00:33:45.240 years or something right it's a
00:33:46.720 confusing phase for most Americans we
00:33:49.240 take that normal adolescent confusion
00:33:51.440 confusion and then we try to medicalize
00:33:53.760 it and nobody's saying oh when we do
00:33:55.679 medicalize it by the way a lot of
00:33:57.000 pharmaceutical companies get very rich
00:33:58.480 off of it not only very rich but then
00:34:00.559 the child is sterilized yes I mean this
00:34:03.360 is for a lot of these kids they'll never
00:34:05.159 be able to have children ever again if
00:34:06.720 they change their mind if they one day
00:34:09.918 decide oh I I was just going through a
00:34:11.879 confusing time in my life but now I've
00:34:14.000 ruined my voice with hormones my o
00:34:16.199 ovaries are destroyed you know I had my
00:34:19.320 testicles removed like the whole thing
00:34:21.159 is crazy so this is where I had the real
00:34:23.760 Breaking Point with a friend that I
00:34:24.960 mentioned earlier is she made this argum
00:34:27.719 argument that puberty blockers are fully
00:34:30.440 reversible that's crazy and IID actually
00:34:32.119 never heard that I me this is a few
00:34:33.239 years ago I'd never heard that argument
00:34:34.639 before and so I actually went and looked
00:34:35.960 at it and looked at the data on this the
00:34:38.359 idea that if you give puberty delaying
00:34:41.839 puberty blockers whatever you're going
00:34:43.280 to call them to kids who are 11 12 13
00:34:46.320 that that's fully reversible that is
00:34:48.560 completely and preposterously insane now
00:34:51.359 even the most radical Advocates of trans
00:34:54.199 Healthcare do not say that right because
00:34:57.280 look you have sexual dysfunction you
00:34:59.280 have to your point you know hair and
00:35:01.440 weird places that won't go away you have
00:35:03.760 voice changes that won't go away we are
00:35:06.720 experimenting on tens of thousands of
00:35:09.119 American children we're making them
00:35:11.359 miserable it's not having any long-term
00:35:13.720 health benefit it's making a lot of
00:35:14.960 pharmaceutical companies rich and it's
00:35:16.920 conservative Republicans are the only
00:35:18.520 ones saying ah maybe this is a little
00:35:20.520 crazy maybe we should stop well it just
00:35:22.640 shows you how a lot of this you know if
00:35:26.280 you can call it a mind virus or whatever
00:35:28.480 it is it it does make people behave
00:35:30.920 religiously yes so it's like they're
00:35:33.280 ignoring all of these signs because it
00:35:35.960 doesn't line up with this ideology that
00:35:38.200 they subscribed to that's right like you
00:35:40.119 you have to support trans kids like okay
00:35:42.960 what are you even saying how is this a
00:35:45.359 new thing so pervasive how is it
00:35:48.760 everywhere and how are you letting them
00:35:50.680 compete with girls in school this is th
00:35:54.680 that one drives me bananas when you have
00:35:57.200 biolog iCal males all they have to do is
00:36:00.000 they don't even have requirements in
00:36:01.640 some schools you don't have to be taking
00:36:03.079 hormones you can just identify and you
00:36:05.480 can compete as a girl and of course that
00:36:07.680 causes injury to the young girls of
00:36:09.760 course and again this gives me faith in
00:36:12.720 the wisdom of the American people
00:36:15.079 because if you see how radically the
00:36:18.079 Democrats leaned into this stuff four
00:36:19.960 years ago and how much you know KLA
00:36:22.280 Harris is running away from it today
00:36:24.480 most Americans they don't really care
00:36:26.800 who you sleep with they're pretty
00:36:28.280 open-minded about most lifestyle choices
00:36:30.599 but when you talk about having a
00:36:32.200 biological male compete with their
00:36:34.119 teenage girl in competitive Sports
00:36:36.960 Americans are saying no no no no this is
00:36:39.319 crazy you're causing injury to my kids
00:36:41.560 we have to stop this not only that it
00:36:44.000 like ruins chances of getting
00:36:46.119 scholarships if you were the number one
00:36:48.319 player and then all of a sudden some guy
00:36:50.599 comes along who wears lipstick now he's
00:36:53.280 the number one girl on the team like
00:36:54.920 what are you talking about yeah yeah
00:36:56.640 there was a recent pool tournament in
00:36:58.480 England it's a women's pool tournament
00:37:00.440 and in the semifinals two guys are
00:37:02.119 playing each other yeah well and it
00:37:03.839 looks when you see them in the actual
00:37:06.520 you know swimming pool competing it
00:37:08.200 looks like the biological males are
00:37:10.480 running at 1.5x speed and everybody else
00:37:13.280 is running at normal speed right this is
00:37:15.480 just clearly different and you to your
00:37:18.280 point about it destroys opportunities
00:37:20.119 for scholarships I mean go back to the
00:37:21.440 original reason why we wanted girls
00:37:23.800 Sports why we have Title 9 in the United
00:37:25.640 States of America to begin with like we
00:37:27.640 recognized the competitive sports like
00:37:29.800 what does it teach right it teaches you
00:37:31.720 how to participate on a team it teaches
00:37:33.880 you to recognize your own weaknesses and
00:37:35.839 the strengths of your teammates and vice
00:37:37.560 versa right like I I'm I'm the father of
00:37:39.640 a 2-year-old daughter I want my daughter
00:37:41.800 to learn these important life skills I
00:37:44.400 don't want her going into athletic
00:37:46.079 competitions where I'm terrified she's
00:37:48.119 going to get bludgeon to death because
00:37:49.640 we're allowing a 6'1 male to compete
00:37:52.079 with her in sports where you should not
00:37:54.640 have biological males competing with
00:37:56.520 biological females not only that but
00:37:58.200 they get to change with them in the
00:37:59.680 locker rooms that's where it gets like
00:38:01.720 there was one in Canada where a
00:38:04.240 50-year-old man identified as a teenage
00:38:07.920 girl he was a professor do you know
00:38:10.119 about this guy I haven't heard about
00:38:11.480 this he was he was changing he was in a
00:38:14.200 swim meet with teenage girls yeah and
00:38:16.880 he's changing in the same locker room as
00:38:19.040 them and then it's crazy the problem
00:38:21.720 with that is people there's there's a
00:38:24.160 psychological condition called autog
00:38:25.960 gyil and autog feel is where men are
00:38:29.000 sexually aroused by the idea of dressing
00:38:31.079 and behaving like a woman but they're
00:38:33.400 heterosexual now all of a sudden these
00:38:35.800 people with this known psychiatric
00:38:37.960 disorder are allowed to just identify as
00:38:41.160 a woman and you're a bigot if you don't
00:38:42.920 let them change in the women's and
00:38:44.319 you're expected to empower them at the
00:38:46.920 expense of young women who are very
00:38:49.200 often much more vulnerable for obvious
00:38:51.040 reasons than young men and it reminds me
00:38:53.200 of so the very first Congressional
00:38:55.720 Delegation trip that I ever took was to
00:38:57.560 Paris I think it was to to Paris and
00:39:00.359 it's part of the Paris Air Show and Ohio
00:39:02.440 has all these you know Aviation
00:39:03.720 interests and anyway long story short I
00:39:05.680 was talking to a very conservative woman
00:39:07.640 at the Paris Air Show who was from
00:39:09.640 Mississippi and she was probably
00:39:12.000 6570 and it was really interesting
00:39:14.240 because I was just like you know how do
00:39:15.599 how do you find the city she had never
00:39:16.720 been to Paris before and I'm just you
00:39:18.560 know interested in people so I was
00:39:19.680 asking her and she said you know what's
00:39:20.839 really interesting is I just feel like
00:39:25.000 Paris I would think of as very liberal
00:39:27.400 but I actually think Paris is more
00:39:28.839 conservative than some of the big cities
00:39:30.400 in the United States and I said oh he
00:39:32.480 tell me more about this and this woman
00:39:33.720 doesn't know me very well and she's
00:39:35.040 clearly kind of embarrassed to tell me
00:39:37.200 but she walks through she says well I
00:39:39.839 just don't see any people like when
00:39:41.480 you're in Paris the girls are girls and
00:39:44.560 the boys are boys and that's true in
00:39:47.160 Paris and that's not necessarily true in
00:39:49.520 some of our big cities and then and then
00:39:51.440 she says she she says she says Senator
00:39:53.800 Vance I'm embarrassed to tell you this
00:39:56.079 but when I was in New York City recently
00:39:58.480 I saw a grown man who was walking around
00:40:01.240 in a miniskirt and then she gets very
00:40:03.359 quiet and she said Cinder fans I could
00:40:05.359 see his
00:40:07.079 balls he probably wanted you to see his
00:40:09.400 balls and you realize oh my God this is
00:40:13.000 not this is not empowerment this is not
00:40:15.359 respecting lifestyle choices we're
00:40:17.440 letting a grown man walk around in a
00:40:19.280 miniskirt in broad daylight like what
00:40:21.160 are you talk about I feel like you
00:40:22.040 should be allowed to wear a Min skirt if
00:40:24.240 a girl can wear a mini skirt you can
00:40:25.520 wear a mini skirt that's not what
00:40:26.720 bothers me but what me I have to see
00:40:29.359 your balls to flash people in broad
00:40:31.440 daylight in New York City pervert that's
00:40:34.440 what you're doing you're a pervert and I
00:40:36.119 want I want all of us to say whatever
00:40:38.040 your political persuasion just say no
00:40:40.240 that's weird you're not allowed to walk
00:40:41.960 down the street and Flash children in
00:40:44.680 the middle of the world's or the
00:40:46.560 America's biggest city and it reminds me
00:40:48.800 you know Emanuel mccrone who's the the
00:40:50.560 leader of France made this observation
00:40:52.520 about you know somebody asked him why
00:40:54.319 hasn't all the transgender stuff made
00:40:56.640 its way into France and Emanuel mcon
00:40:59.240 says well in France we have two genders
00:41:01.000 and that's
00:41:02.319 plenty I kind of wish that was the
00:41:05.800 attitude that we had in the United
00:41:07.800 States of America well have you ever
00:41:09.240 heard mark andreon break down um that
00:41:12.480 the why woke is like a cult he does it
00:41:15.119 he's a brilliant guy he's a very he's a
00:41:16.880 very good friend yeah I I've heard this
00:41:18.599 yeah it's brilliant and he talks about
00:41:20.960 how you can be excommunicated from the
00:41:22.520 cult if you don't follow the doctrine
00:41:24.280 you have to follow religiously to the
00:41:26.280 letter that's where all this stuff like
00:41:28.800 if you're allowing guys to just have
00:41:30.160 their balls hanging out walking on the
00:41:31.520 street because it's empowering yeah and
00:41:33.680 because like you're being inclusive like
00:41:36.440 well no you're empowering perverts yeah
00:41:38.240 it's a cult and it's a religion but with
00:41:39.880 one big difference and I think this is
00:41:41.880 you know actually this this observation
00:41:43.760 is probably one of the things that led
00:41:44.760 me back to my own faith but I I I sort
00:41:47.079 of just a fundamental background belief
00:41:49.319 I have about humanity is you know we are
00:41:51.680 the hardware right we're biological
00:41:53.319 organisms we're the hardware and the
00:41:55.599 software is the ideas that we have in
00:41:57.000 our head
00:41:58.000 and certain software promotes human
00:42:00.119 flourishing and certain software
00:42:02.079 destroys human flourishing and I think
00:42:04.240 that the the good kind of ideas tend to
00:42:06.400 promote human flourishing what is what
00:42:09.079 you know most world
00:42:10.680 religions have but the woke stuff
00:42:13.960 doesn't have is forgiveness and
00:42:16.119 Redemption yes right it has the
00:42:18.280 excommunication part but it doesn't have
00:42:20.400 the forgiveness and Redemption Part most
00:42:22.680 people recognize that even if you
00:42:25.160 violate some fundamental moral value I
00:42:27.440 have if you apologize and try to be a
00:42:30.400 good person we're going to be forgiving
00:42:33.119 we want people to be able to live
00:42:34.760 together there is this weird thing with
00:42:36.760 the woke stuff where when and you see
00:42:39.040 this and I feel bad when like comedians
00:42:40.680 in particular do it I'm sure you've seen
00:42:42.079 this but when anybody does this where
00:42:44.880 they'll go and say well I'm really sorry
00:42:48.880 they'll sort of prostrate themselves
00:42:50.760 when they make an offensive joke or they
00:42:52.480 do something they're not supposed to do
00:42:54.400 and they expect Redemption but no no no
00:42:57.200 they don't get forgiveness what they get
00:42:59.599 is you need to do even more of what
00:43:02.119 you've already done it becomes this
00:43:03.640 self-defeating self- flatulating cycle
00:43:06.599 and I think that's the what's most
00:43:08.440 destructive about this is you can't be
00:43:11.079 friends with people if you think they're
00:43:13.880 only you know they're only ever wrong
00:43:16.680 they can only ever wrong you and and
00:43:19.359 they if they apologize your respons is
00:43:21.240 not to say oh okay I accept your apology
00:43:23.559 if your response is to say no I want you
00:43:25.040 to apologize even more and even harder
00:43:27.480 that destroys human civilization that's
00:43:29.720 it's it's an interesting observation
00:43:31.680 right because it really does behave like
00:43:34.280 a religion but it's a religion without
00:43:36.760 like a good Doctrine yes it's a religion
00:43:39.960 that hasn't been thought out by wise
00:43:42.000 people and where they haven't come up
00:43:44.319 with these different like like the Ten
00:43:46.599 Commandments or different Pathways to
00:43:49.400 correct to forgiveness there's there's
00:43:51.880 nothing so it's a this thing that
00:43:53.880 behaves like a religion but it's not
00:43:55.359 really well thought out and it's very
00:43:57.160 loic and it also combines pharmaceutical
00:44:00.359 drug companies and all there's a lot of
00:44:02.119 other weird [ __ ] that's attached to this
00:44:03.880 religion yes that you kind of need like
00:44:06.800 if if if if you're going to do this
00:44:08.839 whole woke thing and like go guns of
00:44:11.119 Blazing you're going to have to get
00:44:12.839 drugs involved like you're going to have
00:44:14.480 to they're going to have to do hormone
00:44:15.839 blockers it's like it doesn't just
00:44:17.520 happen on its own and that somehow or
00:44:19.720 another is natural to them like this is
00:44:21.960 how you be your your true self like your
00:44:24.480 true self is you you add hormones that
00:44:27.559 aren't supposed to be in your body
00:44:28.839 that's your true self like how do you
00:44:30.559 know and and it's irreversible are we
00:44:33.160 [ __ ] sure this is yeah and oh by the
00:44:35.640 way instead of your true self being
00:44:39.400 maybe I should be skeptical of some of
00:44:41.559 the crap that I'm putting into my body I
00:44:43.640 should lean into the idea that I should
00:44:45.599 put more foreign things into the human
00:44:48.599 body that that's what to me is so
00:44:50.440 fascinating about it is the true self
00:44:53.160 like you know I think all of us that's
00:44:54.920 sort of part of the human Journey For
00:44:56.800 Truth truth we're all asking who is you
00:44:58.400 know who are we what is our true self
00:45:01.200 and maybe we should be asking oursel
00:45:03.200 this is sort of more of a Bobby Kennedy
00:45:04.760 point but why are we putting all this
00:45:06.720 weird crap into our food into our water
00:45:10.240 maybe we should be a little bit more
00:45:11.599 skeptical like my body as a temple
00:45:14.200 rather than I'm going to welcome even
00:45:16.440 more pharmaceutical intervention into
00:45:18.680 the human body it's very interesting how
00:45:21.000 some religions view the body as a temple
00:45:23.880 and some religions almost invite the
00:45:25.800 pollution I think the woke say is
00:45:27.280 inviting the pollution well they're also
00:45:29.720 inviting see what one of the weirdest
00:45:32.000 things is if you are on the wrong side
00:45:35.599 of their ideology like if you're aligned
00:45:38.359 with Trump like RFK Jr is now all a
00:45:41.160 sudden I've seen like people on the left
00:45:44.160 that are trying to dismiss a lot of the
00:45:46.760 things that he says about additives and
00:45:49.240 food about atrazine fluoride in the wall
00:45:52.240 all these different things because now
00:45:53.880 they're connecting not having toxins in
00:45:57.160 your food with a right-wing idea it's
00:46:01.559 crazy it's mindblowing it's so bananas
00:46:04.400 like even being healthy Fitness Fitness
00:46:06.960 they're connecting Fitness with a
00:46:08.359 right-wing idea like yeah well and it it
00:46:11.319 raises one of my sort of core political
00:46:13.920 beliefs is that our politics is focused
00:46:16.559 on fake [ __ ] and distractions to
00:46:19.040 distract us from the real stuff right
00:46:21.000 and so if I'm looking at the
00:46:23.559 environmental movement in the United
00:46:24.800 States of America and I don't even have
00:46:26.599 like strong views on the you know what
00:46:29.520 the carbon footprint ultimately does I'm
00:46:31.440 sort of skeptical of the experts here
00:46:33.280 but I'm also skeptical of you know the
00:46:35.240 other side I I just don't really know
00:46:36.520 what I think about this I think it's
00:46:38.119 insane to try to eliminate fossil fuels
00:46:40.040 that's kind of a belief that I have but
00:46:41.800 it's interesting that the environmental
00:46:43.599 movement in America the only thing that
00:46:45.400 it talks about is the carbon footprint
00:46:47.720 and it never talks about like oh why do
00:46:49.440 we have the highest rates of obesity in
00:46:51.880 the world right now right why why is it
00:46:54.599 that American Kids spend less time
00:46:57.040 outdoors in nature than they ever have
00:46:59.920 in the history of our 250 years
00:47:01.920 civilization there's this weird way in
00:47:04.160 which we get distracted by the fake
00:47:05.960 stuff instead of focusing on the real
00:47:07.920 stuff and I think there is a really very
00:47:09.920 important environmental conversation to
00:47:11.760 be had it was interesting when one of
00:47:14.480 the first things that happened when I
00:47:15.280 was a Senator is you had this terrible
00:47:16.920 train derailment in East Palestine Ohio
00:47:19.440 got a lot of headlines and it was a
00:47:21.760 mistake at the time that wasn't obvious
00:47:23.960 they basically set off a few of the
00:47:26.040 chemical cars which I mean if you see
00:47:28.480 the images it looks like a nuclear bomb
00:47:30.880 went off in East Palestine Ohio but it's
00:47:33.520 putting Vinyl chloride and all these
00:47:35.000 other pollutants into the water into the
00:47:36.880 air into the soil and it was amazing the
00:47:40.040 environmental movement almost could not
00:47:41.920 have cared less about a chemical
00:47:44.720 explosion in rural Ohio that is
00:47:48.040 potentially poisoning thousands of
00:47:49.800 people but they were really really
00:47:52.079 concerned about the carbon footprint of
00:47:54.640 those same people I I I I I'm I'm sick
00:47:57.839 of the distraction I think we should
00:47:59.359 focus on the real stuff and
00:48:00.880 unfortunately it's true of the
00:48:02.319 environmental policy but it's true of a
00:48:03.680 lot of other stuff we just don't talk
00:48:05.359 about the real thing the carbon
00:48:07.119 footprint think is very concerning to me
00:48:10.200 because I'm I'm seeing this concept that
00:48:13.800 being pushed out of having an app that
00:48:16.760 monitors your carbon footprint and
00:48:18.680 limiting the amount of travel you can do
00:48:20.400 and limiting the amount thing I know
00:48:21.800 where that's going to go yeah just
00:48:23.079 control it's just controlling contr and
00:48:25.880 if you can do that then you can get away
00:48:27.760 with a lot of things you can get a lot
00:48:29.280 away with a lot of policy you get away
00:48:31.240 with a lot of decisions that are made
00:48:33.000 that people wouldn't agree with because
00:48:34.960 you're going to limit so many things
00:48:36.960 about their life they're going to become
00:48:38.160 accustomed to being governed in that way
00:48:41.160 it just it's disturbing to me that
00:48:42.839 there's also profit that's being made
00:48:44.400 off the green movement there's a lot of
00:48:46.440 people like Bill Gates who have like
00:48:48.760 making a lot of money off of these
00:48:51.200 environmentally conscious things $50
00:48:53.839 million Comm Harris by the way although
00:48:55.760 is [ __ ] fake food that fake meat
00:48:58.799 which is not good for anybody me out man
00:49:01.079 you read about fake meat folks read
00:49:03.640 about how they're making this and I'm
00:49:05.040 not talking about 3D printed meat which
00:49:06.960 is a very different thing which seems to
00:49:09.160 be at least more consumable but like the
00:49:12.480 plant-based meat stuff that's garbage
00:49:14.960 that stuff is garbage so highly
00:49:16.839 processed garbage if you want to eat
00:49:18.880 vegetables and beat vegetarian eat
00:49:21.119 Indian food okay like they make really
00:49:24.240 delicious Indian am they make very good
00:49:27.240 they make the best vegetarian food but
00:49:28.960 it tastes good and it's actually
00:49:30.559 vegetables it's not this crazy fake
00:49:33.680 cheeseburger thing that you have like no
00:49:35.359 that's right stop eating that when we
00:49:37.280 when I first started dating my wife I
00:49:38.880 just had no idea like what vegetarians
00:49:40.839 ate right I'm like a meat and potatoes
00:49:43.119 um guy from Ohio and I wanted to make
00:49:45.839 her dinner and I wanted to really
00:49:46.839 impress her cuz I was like madly in love
00:49:48.440 with her and did you cook beef no the
00:49:51.720 meal that I the meal that I made her I'm
00:49:53.640 not proud of this but I'll tell you was
00:49:55.799 you know Crescent are those like
00:49:58.079 Pillsbury yeast rolls so I rolled out a
00:50:00.960 flat thing of crescent rolls I put raw
00:50:03.599 broccoli on top of it I sprinkled ranch
00:50:06.319 dressing and I stuck it in the oven for
00:50:08.040 45 minutes and it was disgusting and
00:50:11.599 that was my vegetarian pizza that I made
00:50:13.880 wow did you follow a recipe no you just
00:50:17.960 like decided it's like it's like cream I
00:50:20.680 know she she ate you know Dairy it's
00:50:22.720 it's it's broccoli and it's bread right
00:50:24.480 that's what vegetarians eat so yeah I I
00:50:26.480 think that to your point vegetarian food
00:50:29.160 can actually be quite good yes I don't
00:50:31.079 you know I still I still like I'm kind
00:50:33.000 of one of these people where if I don't
00:50:34.520 have a piece of meat it's not a complete
00:50:36.040 meal but if you're going to eat
00:50:37.559 vegetarian eat paneer and rice and
00:50:41.000 delicious chickpeas do not eat this
00:50:42.960 disgusting fake meat I'm just very
00:50:44.839 skeptical when someone is promoting
00:50:48.839 things for either Global health or for
00:50:51.920 the environment and then I find out that
00:50:54.480 they have a ton of money invested in
00:50:57.280 companies that could fit those needs
00:51:01.680 it's it's a real problem this philanth
00:51:04.319 capitalism it's very weird man we got to
00:51:06.680 look at the we have to look at the
00:51:08.280 financial incentives of this I mean so
00:51:09.920 one of the big things that me and
00:51:11.520 president Trump confront all the time is
00:51:13.040 the accusation that we're somehow like
00:51:14.559 in bed with Russia which is like the the
00:51:16.520 dumbest thing in the world to me like I
00:51:17.880 don't really care about Russia I just
00:51:19.559 don't think we should have a nuclear war
00:51:21.000 like RIT large I'm very anti-nuclear War
00:51:23.280 sounds reasonable thank you appreciate
00:51:25.079 that and one of the things they never
00:51:28.440 interrogate is who is the biggest funer
00:51:31.280 of the green energy movement in Europe
00:51:34.400 it's the Russians and why are the
00:51:36.280 Russians funding it's not because they
00:51:37.400 care about climate change it's because
00:51:39.160 they want the Germans and everybody else
00:51:41.040 to buy Russian natural gas and they
00:51:43.160 realize that if the Germans and French
00:51:44.720 close down all their coal and nuclear
00:51:46.359 factories Russia is going to have them
00:51:48.160 buy the balls how do they get the
00:51:49.839 Germans to
00:51:51.280 close oh
00:51:53.760 it's m did mine did okay
00:51:59.359 okay see what's
00:52:01.280 up one
00:52:07.720 of holy [ __ ] the Russians the Russians
00:52:10.559 are monitoring this [ __ ]
00:52:12.400 [Laughter]
00:52:14.200 conversation don't know what happen
00:52:15.920 check check yeah oh I hear me now yeah I
00:52:18.680 hear me yeah okay got it yeah what what
00:52:21.960 no I'm out no it's gone again Jamie huh
00:52:27.240 we'll be right back oh I'm back yeah but
00:52:29.359 I don't even know if I'm going to stay
00:52:30.559 back how I know if it keeps working well
00:52:32.559 I'm listening but I don't know what what
00:52:34.160 happened okay should we shift or should
00:52:36.720 we just let's try this and then we
00:52:38.799 can keep going just let me know if it
00:52:41.000 goes again and I'll put my headphones on
00:52:42.680 if it goes again had a slight technical
00:52:44.480 problem ladies and gentlemen so where
00:52:46.160 were we talking
00:52:48.400 about Jam
00:52:51.240 button it must be I don't know where it
00:52:54.240 is but your foot's not touching it no
00:52:57.880 am I touching something no no no no okay
00:53:00.920 it's
00:53:01.839 back it's back Jamie Jamie you got to
00:53:05.000 replace this I keep saying that but now
00:53:06.760 you really
00:53:10.280 do we
00:53:12.079 good I hear it yeah yeah okay I'm not
00:53:14.880 going to move I'm not touching anything
00:53:17.240 all right we're back what were we just
00:53:18.960 talking about well we were talking about
00:53:20.960 how you asked why why do the Germans
00:53:23.640 shut down their nuclear facilities and I
00:53:25.280 know you know it's they're shutting down
00:53:27.440 coal they're shutting down any of their
00:53:29.359 base power and leaning really into solar
00:53:32.400 and wind but again the the green energy
00:53:35.720 movement in Europe is heavily funded by
00:53:38.240 the Russians because the Russians want
00:53:40.000 to have because they produce so much
00:53:41.400 natural gas they want to have Europe buy
00:53:43.400 the balls so again how do they convince
00:53:46.440 them to shut down their nuclear power
00:53:48.000 plants well in the same way that Bill
00:53:49.599 Gates is convincing us to eat fake meat
00:53:51.400 is they fund all this stuff and they
00:53:52.960 make it about the environment well
00:53:54.359 that's true but he's trying to the
00:53:56.880 problem is you look at him and you go
00:54:01.160 hey how are you a health expert this is
00:54:04.280 look at you the funniest thing ever was
00:54:06.839 when Elon put showed a photo of Bill
00:54:09.240 Gates next to a photo of a pregnant man
00:54:11.520 emoji and he said if you want to lose a
00:54:13.000 boner real quick
00:54:16.079 and that's a wild boy you imagine Elon
00:54:20.040 is funny as [ __ ] man he's actually he's
00:54:22.200 funny as [ __ ] getting dumped on by that
00:54:24.240 guy's got to suck cuz you can't even say
00:54:26.040 he's a dumb ass right that's right you
00:54:29.200 can say many things you can't say he's a
00:54:31.119 dumbass you get Dunked On by one of the
00:54:32.680 smartest guys alive but the point is
00:54:34.359 like Bill doesn't look good he looks
00:54:36.119 terrible he's aging way harder than
00:54:37.960 Trump like it doesn't whatever you're
00:54:39.880 doing don't eat like that anymore like
00:54:41.359 go to an actual doctor like I don't know
00:54:43.200 what you're doing who's telling you eat
00:54:45.040 your fake meat this is you look like
00:54:47.359 [ __ ] so you can't give advice this is
00:54:49.599 crazy you can't give advice about health
00:54:51.799 you're not a healthy person that's right
00:54:53.760 you know well I did so there's this
00:54:55.400 thing called the munic SEC Conference in
00:54:58.079 uh in Germany obviously it's in Munich
00:55:00.000 it's kind of like Davos but for National
00:55:02.119 Security and I went there and it was
00:55:03.680 like a big deal for me because I went in
00:55:05.160 there as the one skeptic in the entire
00:55:07.880 this like massive Euro complex KLA
00:55:09.920 Harris is there I went as the person
00:55:11.760 skeptical of continued escalation in
00:55:13.440 Ukraine because I think that what we're
00:55:14.480 doing in Ukraine is insane and that we
00:55:16.839 should have a policy effectively of
00:55:18.520 promoting peace in the region and we we
00:55:21.760 walk in and one of the people that I'm
00:55:23.880 on this panel with is the leader of the
00:55:26.319 German green
00:55:27.559 party and you know she's she's like 30
00:55:31.599 years old and she really really cares
00:55:34.559 about Russia Ukraine she's like the
00:55:36.079 youngest person in the German government
00:55:38.160 and you realize you are like the exact
00:55:42.440 like you guys are literally Russian
00:55:44.119 influence like you're accusing me of
00:55:45.640 wanting to do Russia's bidding you're
00:55:47.599 encouraging your own country from the
00:55:49.680 perch of government to shut down all
00:55:52.000 Basel load power and you're not even
00:55:54.760 self-aware about how much of your own
00:55:57.520 propaganda is funded by the country
00:56:00.200 that's benefiting from this the the lack
00:56:02.240 of ability to interrogate I mean Bill
00:56:03.920 Gates you know like maybe he's a good
00:56:06.640 guy I'm highly skeptical I don't know
00:56:08.319 him very well but he's getting rich off
00:56:11.079 of all of this stuff that he's
00:56:13.039 supporting in the name of health or in
00:56:14.920 the name of climate our inability to
00:56:17.640 just ask ourselves who's getting rich
00:56:20.000 from this stuff maybe we should be
00:56:21.480 skeptical of the people getting rich
00:56:22.880 from this stuff is one of our big
00:56:24.920 failures as a political soci
00:56:26.760 it's a sheep costume you put on a sheep
00:56:29.280 costume and you make a lot of money with
00:56:31.760 global Health you know and who doesn't
00:56:34.599 want Global Health what a nice guy yeah
00:56:37.400 oh he's like very philanthropic he's
00:56:39.839 he's spending all this money trying to
00:56:41.200 help poor people right and then you find
00:56:42.880 out like wait a minute how much money
00:56:44.200 did you make doing that yeah exactly you
00:56:46.400 made a $500 million doing that that's
00:56:49.960 crazy it's it's a very sneaky move but
00:56:53.000 he's he's a smart guy he's in a lot of
00:56:55.200 very sneaky moves like the donating all
00:56:57.440 the money to the media companies which
00:56:59.559 is why they never criticize him right
00:57:02.680 he's donated like 350 million dollars to
00:57:05.160 all these different companies that's
00:57:06.480 right or you know this is I think one of
00:57:08.160 the reasons why we don't have more
00:57:09.559 people asking questions about big Pharma
00:57:11.440 of is the entire National media think
00:57:13.680 about how many pharmaceutical
00:57:14.720 advertisements you watch when you watch
00:57:16.000 a football game yeah let's get into this
00:57:18.000 because this is an interesting one so
00:57:20.200 one of the things that happened that
00:57:22.000 separated us from the rest of the world
00:57:23.839 other than New Zealand is in the 1990s
00:57:25.960 they allowed pharmaceutical drug
00:57:27.440 companies to advertise that's right what
00:57:29.880 do you is that something that has to
00:57:32.559 stay that way is that something that
00:57:34.599 could be changed in with policy or is
00:57:37.280 the financial incentives of that too big
00:57:40.359 to move oh you could change it with
00:57:42.440 policy I don't know that you do you
00:57:44.039 think that you would have enough support
00:57:45.359 to do something like that it's
00:57:46.240 interesting question I I so I've been
00:57:48.079 critical of pharmaceutical advertising
00:57:49.559 for a long time uh my assumption is that
00:57:51.839 there are not enough people who would
00:57:53.000 like to do it to actually get it done
00:57:54.559 but you know I've never actually talked
00:57:56.160 to my colleagues about it so may maybe
00:57:58.359 it's possible I bet if you ask the
00:58:00.119 American people you know I bet that's
00:58:02.559 one of those things if you put it to a
00:58:04.160 national vote instead of Representatives
00:58:06.440 the problem with Representatives is
00:58:07.760 special interest groups special interest
00:58:10.000 groups lobbyists and the amount of money
00:58:12.880 yeah the the whole conduit of money into
00:58:14.520 politics is fundamentally broken I think
00:58:16.039 we have to fix that but I mean here okay
00:58:18.000 here's the thing and I say this as a
00:58:19.160 Critic of pharmaceutical advertising
00:58:21.000 whenever I see a Pharma ad and I pretty
00:58:22.720 much only see them when I'm watching
00:58:24.119 football I'm always sh shocked that they
00:58:26.720 actually influence anybody right because
00:58:28.440 it's like oh take this drug for
00:58:30.559 rheumatoid arthritis and you can have
00:58:32.359 all these positive experiences and it's
00:58:33.799 like oh the side effects are uh you know
00:58:36.680 erectile dysfunction rashes on your face
00:58:39.640 suicid suicidal ideation tumors in your
00:58:42.359 brain and you'll hate yourself and be
00:58:44.680 depressed so you'll need this other drug
00:58:46.240 and I always wonder like you get so many
00:58:48.880 of these weird side effects in the
00:58:50.400 advertisements how how do they actually
00:58:52.400 work so I actually think that the real
00:58:54.039 corruption is not really that they like
00:58:56.160 persuade Americans I mean if you're
00:58:59.079 going to take a drug you're probably
00:59:00.880 going to take a drug based on
00:59:02.280 conversations with your doctor more than
00:59:03.680 a Pharm advertisement but they do
00:59:05.520 corrupt the media ecosystem because if
00:59:07.599 you're getting all that money from the
00:59:08.880 Pharma companies then you're not going
00:59:10.520 to launch investigations into some of
00:59:12.280 the things you should be launching
00:59:13.240 investigations into 100% and that's why
00:59:16.000 it's dangerous because it's not like
00:59:17.480 these are completely innocent companies
00:59:19.119 and have never done anything wrong so if
00:59:21.160 you all of a sudden have them removed
00:59:23.359 from your list of people that you're
00:59:24.480 investigating just because they
00:59:26.160 advertised they've essentially bribed
00:59:27.480 you that's right they've bribed you and
00:59:29.599 you're supposed to be the people that
00:59:31.960 distribute the actual news to the
00:59:33.799 American people and you're compromised
00:59:36.280 so okay so let me tell you this this
00:59:37.599 story and this is okay this is purely
00:59:41.599 secondary so if you know somebody tries
00:59:44.119 to fact check it I heard this from a
00:59:45.599 friend but I heard it from a friend I I
00:59:47.520 trusted so he was a guy I knew and he
00:59:50.160 worked at the largest industry lobbying
00:59:52.400 Organization for the pharmaceutical
00:59:54.000 companies and I was in DC this is a long
00:59:56.720 time ago and I just kind of ran into
00:59:58.480 them and you know I care a lot about the
01:00:00.079 opioid problem uh my mom struggled with
01:00:02.480 opioids for a very long time she's been
01:00:04.000 clean and sober for a while but I'm very
01:00:06.319 proud of you I love you mom I know
01:00:07.559 you're watching this but Jan into this
01:00:10.359 guy in the street in DC and he's he had
01:00:12.839 just quit his job for this
01:00:14.160 pharmaceutical lobbying organization or
01:00:15.799 he was talking about quitting and I was
01:00:17.720 like why he's like man we just did
01:00:19.039 something that's very dark and basically
01:00:22.000 what they had figured out is because
01:00:24.599 American Indian tribes Americans have
01:00:26.960 Tribal sovereignty and so they figured
01:00:29.440 out I guess that if they gave some
01:00:33.119 Native American tribe some fraction of a
01:00:36.119 fraction of a penny of the royalties
01:00:39.240 from the cell of opioids that they could
01:00:41.960 actually insulate themselves from
01:00:44.119 litigation around the prescription
01:00:46.400 opioid epidemic and I guess this guy was
01:00:49.359 just like thought it was so dirty that
01:00:52.160 he was like I can't I can't work for
01:00:53.480 this organization anymore and I was like
01:00:55.559 holy [ __ ] that is some pretty dark stuff
01:00:58.119 so you guys are giving some Native
01:01:00.079 American tribe like pennies so that you
01:01:03.119 can insulate yourself from
01:01:05.640 pharmaceutical litigation I I'd be very
01:01:07.640 curious I should follow up on this to
01:01:09.119 see if that actually happened but again
01:01:11.640 just to be clear if the media tries to
01:01:13.319 fact check me this is what I heard from
01:01:14.799 friend Jamie fact check right now Jamie
01:01:16.400 I'm very curious if this actually
01:01:17.400 happened look it look into it because
01:01:19.720 but I I think it did happen because I
01:01:21.319 saw the look on this guy's face and he
01:01:22.640 was like man this is some pretty dark
01:01:24.480 stuff that's crazy
01:01:26.520 yeah but that's how corporations behave
01:01:29.720 you know we were just the trigonometry
01:01:31.280 guys were on here yesterday and we were
01:01:33.160 talking about it that corporations
01:01:35.200 behave like Psychopaths like that's
01:01:37.079 there's a book about it it's like they
01:01:39.559 they describe how this endless Pursuit
01:01:42.359 cut off again it really you know what it
01:01:44.319 is Jamie whenever I move the mic tell me
01:01:46.200 when it's back you just hit it and it
01:01:47.920 made a noise it must be the cable
01:01:52.200 sorry oh this is it dude that got it oh
01:01:54.880 you got it this was Lo
01:01:56.400 try it now tell me
01:01:59.039 now I mean I heard that click I bet
01:02:01.240 that's what it was is that it we're good
01:02:02.799 okay what was that thing you want me to
01:02:04.200 check real quick sorry um pharmaceutical
01:02:07.400 companies
01:02:08.880 using um giving royalty streams to
01:02:12.000 Native American tribes to insulate
01:02:14.039 themselves from lawsuits anyway yeah
01:02:16.279 it's very scary stuff well yeah it's and
01:02:19.079 it's this is like one of the things that
01:02:20.640 I think is genuinely different about and
01:02:23.200 I don't want to get too too partisan
01:02:24.680 political here but about Donald Trump's
01:02:26.599 Republican party is is I mean obviously
01:02:29.839 like there are corporations that were're
01:02:31.920 more Pro certain businesses and we tend
01:02:34.520 to be more anti certain businesses like
01:02:36.200 for example big Tech I hate big Tech we
01:02:37.960 can get into that later but
01:02:39.760 fundamentally I think president Trump
01:02:42.079 has changed the mindset of the
01:02:43.559 Republican party to where it was like
01:02:45.160 instinctively always Pro corporate we're
01:02:47.640 now sometimes willing to ask well is
01:02:49.240 this corporation's interest and the
01:02:50.880 American interest like there was this
01:02:52.760 famous quote I believe from the
01:02:54.920 leadership of GM back in the 1950s that
01:02:57.760 General Motors interest is America's
01:02:59.839 interest and I'm probably butchering the
01:03:01.760 quote but sort of paraphrased can
01:03:04.119 anybody really in 2024 say that Google's
01:03:07.359 interest is America's interest or apple
01:03:09.960 which employs thousands of slaves and
01:03:12.160 Chin Jen is Apple's interest is
01:03:14.480 America's interest like I I just don't
01:03:16.599 that's ridiculous and the fact that
01:03:18.079 we're at least somewhat skeptical of
01:03:20.960 corporate power in the Republican party
01:03:22.799 I think is a very good trend for us it
01:03:24.400 is kind of weird that one one of the
01:03:26.160 wokest companies if you thought about
01:03:28.279 like woke companies and like super
01:03:30.359 Progressive and like on the right side
01:03:32.160 of everything Apple Apple's like one of
01:03:34.599 the best ones and they have phones that
01:03:38.480 are made by slaves yeah like the the the
01:03:42.039 people definitionally yeah the people
01:03:44.400 are they put Nets around the building CU
01:03:47.319 so many of them were jumping to their
01:03:49.240 deaths yes instead of fixing the work
01:03:51.720 conditions they just go put up some Nets
01:03:54.160 yeah put up put up some Nets so that
01:03:55.400 people
01:03:56.640 the crazy thing is you still like all
01:03:59.599 these like Progressive people are using
01:04:01.880 these devices to talk about like
01:04:03.920 important social issues oh yeah well and
01:04:06.319 talking about distractions right the the
01:04:08.240 distraction like distraction politics
01:04:10.480 versus real politics if Apple says #blm
01:04:14.920 and gives a few million dollars to a
01:04:16.359 trans rights organization then the
01:04:18.240 entire political left ignores that
01:04:20.440 they're profiting off of slave labor
01:04:22.559 it's bizarre now why can't Apple here it
01:04:26.319 is strange beds Native American tribes
01:04:28.720 Biga legitimacy of their Alliance
01:04:31.799 wow so it's true 2019 my God this is
01:04:35.960 about exact you said it's 2019 I was
01:04:37.799 going to say I think I saw that guy in
01:04:39.799 like 2018 it's so gross it's so gross
01:04:43.160 crazy man it's so sick but it's what
01:04:44.799 we're talking about if you allow these
01:04:47.079 corporations look they have an
01:04:48.960 obligation to their shareholders they
01:04:50.799 have to make more money what's the best
01:04:52.599 way to make more money not get sued
01:04:54.359 what's the best way to not get sued for
01:04:56.079 sir I found a loophole he get some
01:04:58.079 [ __ ] ader rid
01:05:00.160 psychopath been working 16 hours like I
01:05:02.880 got a plan against out of here and it
01:05:05.599 works it's legal who I'm sorry like look
01:05:08.400 I get the imper imperative to make money
01:05:10.760 but the guy who thought that up is a
01:05:13.079 grade a sociopath I mean that person is
01:05:16.720 I don't want them anywhere near my kids
01:05:18.559 you got to put guard rails up like you
01:05:20.279 have to have laws that's why you can't
01:05:22.119 have insider trading right like you have
01:05:23.760 have guard rails up don't people go ham
01:05:27.520 and this is why look corporations want
01:05:29.200 to go make money they should make money
01:05:31.240 fine but my job is public and social
01:05:34.680 policy and what really pisses me off and
01:05:37.160 frankly what should piss off more
01:05:38.480 Republicans because you historically the
01:05:40.359 Republican party has been the mo more
01:05:42.079 Pro corporate party we should be saying
01:05:44.599 to the more that these corporations are
01:05:46.520 engaged in social policy in particular
01:05:48.920 left-wing social policy the more that we
01:05:51.119 should be saying ah I don't know that I
01:05:53.559 want to give you everything that you
01:05:55.279 want which is of course what the
01:05:57.000 historical party did but I think is much
01:05:58.799 different in the last few years I'm just
01:06:00.839 scared that the tentacles of the
01:06:03.279 pharmaceutical industry are so deeply
01:06:05.599 entrenched in politics and in media that
01:06:08.520 you can't just shake them off you can't
01:06:10.799 just say hey you can't advertise on TV
01:06:13.599 anymore or hey you no long longer have
01:06:16.839 exemption from responsibility from the
01:06:19.359 side effects of certain drugs because
01:06:21.760 the the that that whole thing they
01:06:23.680 pulled off with exemption of
01:06:26.640 pharmaceutical companies being
01:06:28.920 responsible for
01:06:30.760 injuries was crazy crazy because you
01:06:33.799 just empow these people that have lied
01:06:35.799 forever yeah it does still exist and it
01:06:37.319 still exists and that is totally insane
01:06:39.440 and I I mean you know I so I I I took I
01:06:42.240 took the vax and you know I haven't been
01:06:44.760 boosted or anything but the the moment
01:06:46.960 where I really started to get redpilled
01:06:49.160 on the whole vaa thing was the sickest
01:06:51.520 that I have been in the last 15 years by
01:06:54.279 far was when I took the VAC
01:06:56.400 and I you know I've had Co at this point
01:06:57.799 five times I was in bed for 2 days my
01:07:01.200 heart was racing I was like the fact
01:07:04.039 that we're not even allowed to talk
01:07:05.200 about that even you know I no no like
01:07:07.680 serious injury but but even the fact
01:07:09.839 that we're not even allowed to talk
01:07:10.960 about the fact that I was as sick as
01:07:12.440 I've ever been for two days and the
01:07:14.920 worst covid experience I had was like a
01:07:16.880 sinus infection I'm not really willing
01:07:19.359 to trade that and you don't even you
01:07:21.839 know everybody that I know a lot of
01:07:24.039 people I know they talk about the second
01:07:26.400 shot that they got of the vaccine was
01:07:28.119 really made them really really sick well
01:07:30.880 that's a side effect and not a side
01:07:33.079 effect that we even talk about enough in
01:07:34.400 this country no it's and it's also again
01:07:38.119 we're talking about companies that have
01:07:40.200 a long history of lying and being forced
01:07:43.200 to pay criminal fines and then we're
01:07:45.279 giving them this exemption from being
01:07:48.119 responsible for any of the side effects
01:07:50.079 yeah and who do you think those big
01:07:51.000 Pharma companies donate to politically
01:07:53.799 in 2024
01:07:55.720 a big fat guess probably K
01:07:58.039 Harris by a significant margin well
01:08:00.440 particularly with RFK Jr being attached
01:08:02.880 to Trump sure RFK Jr comes a lot of you
01:08:07.079 know like there's a lot there's a lot
01:08:10.520 that you're going to have to handle
01:08:11.520 there but that's the question is like
01:08:14.440 is are they so entrenched that it's
01:08:17.238 impossible to turn these things that
01:08:18.960 disturb us the fact that they have
01:08:20.359 exemption from any responsibility
01:08:22.799 because of the vaccine the fact that
01:08:24.439 they have the ability to advertise on
01:08:26.479 television can those things be removed
01:08:29.080 is that a possible thing I think it's a
01:08:31.120 possible thing but because I haven't
01:08:33.679 actually done the work to figure out how
01:08:35.319 many of my colleagues would sign on to
01:08:36.960 this I can't say whether it's like a
01:08:39.000 certain thing or a likely thing or just
01:08:40.759 something that we should be working on
01:08:42.479 when I I mean here here interesting
01:08:44.399 thought experiment if there was one
01:08:46.120 thing that we could do to rein in the
01:08:48.600 pharmaceutical companies like what would
01:08:50.319 it be would it be liability on the VAC
01:08:54.080 stuff would it be advertising in my
01:08:56.640 intuition is actually it might be the
01:08:58.120 advertising on the healthcare stuff
01:09:01.479 because that's the way in which they
01:09:03.080 engulf the media into this whole scam
01:09:05.679 that would be great but the the vaccine
01:09:08.719 thing is important too because I will
01:09:10.600 look into it that's that's what I'll
01:09:11.960 that's what I'll say here because I
01:09:13.759 would need to talk to people to see if
01:09:15.000 this is even possible it's a weird one
01:09:17.640 where you're not even allowed to
01:09:19.080 question it you're not allowed to
01:09:20.600 discuss it and that becomes very
01:09:22.759 religious just like all these other
01:09:24.679 things that we talked where you have
01:09:26.759 this this thing that everybody speaks
01:09:29.319 about in hush tones people know people
01:09:31.359 that have been vaccin injured and
01:09:33.120 particularly people on the left they're
01:09:34.520 very reluctant to discuss it even
01:09:36.359 publicly yeah I know people who are
01:09:38.880 public people who have had serious
01:09:40.719 vaccine side effects who do not want
01:09:43.040 anyone to talk about it absolutely
01:09:44.560 they're scared of being labeled an
01:09:46.279 antivaxer I have a c colleague who
01:09:48.399 doesn't want to talk about it but
01:09:49.640 worries that it's like permanently
01:09:51.520 affected his sort of sense of balance
01:09:54.480 and dizziness in Vertigo and yeah it it
01:09:58.600 happens I've talked to a number of
01:09:59.679 people who think that they got vaccine
01:10:00.880 injured some of them are public about it
01:10:02.199 and some of them are not but here's the
01:10:04.280 thing like I'm not even you're probably
01:10:07.000 more anti- Pharma than I am like there
01:10:09.440 are certain things I'm pretty proa too I
01:10:11.360 think they make great drugs that help
01:10:13.560 people all sorts of conditions and
01:10:15.719 diabetes medication insulin I mean like
01:10:18.440 the Sickle Cell stuff that's coming out
01:10:21.040 now we maybe have cured CLE cell disease
01:10:24.280 in Black Americans because of a gene
01:10:26.480 therapy the first I read about it a
01:10:28.120 couple weeks ago actually that the first
01:10:30.280 experimental therapy and it was hard for
01:10:32.600 the kid who took it but you had like an
01:10:34.440 11 or 12-year-old black American just
01:10:36.280 walk out of the hospital and he's
01:10:37.840 probably cured of sickle cell disease
01:10:39.320 right that stuff is amazing but I
01:10:41.640 actually think that in some ways what we
01:10:44.400 should be encouraging these companies to
01:10:46.280 do is that right we want them to develop
01:10:49.000 the life-saving drugs we don't want them
01:10:52.480 to get rich by shielding themselves from
01:10:54.840 liability
01:10:55.960 or or working with Native American
01:10:57.679 tribes so that they don't get sued and I
01:10:59.679 actually think there maybe even is a
01:11:00.960 Harmony between those viewpoints because
01:11:03.120 if they had to get rich by developing
01:11:05.560 life-saving Therapeutics and that's the
01:11:07.120 only way they could get rich then they'd
01:11:08.920 probably do more of that right 100% but
01:11:10.920 again that that's where public policy
01:11:12.320 comes in and that's where like my job is
01:11:14.000 to make sure that when the
01:11:15.440 pharmaceutical companies get rich they
01:11:17.560 get rich by curing diseases not by doing
01:11:19.920 like weird psychotic things with Native
01:11:22.000 American tribes and you can't have this
01:11:23.880 argument that we need exemption from
01:11:26.199 responsibility because otherwise we're
01:11:28.000 not going to be able to profit off of
01:11:29.360 these things like absolutely well that
01:11:31.040 means you're making stuff that too many
01:11:32.880 people are getting sick from so they're
01:11:34.320 [ __ ] suing you that's socialized
01:11:36.800 costs right it's one of the biggest
01:11:38.080 problems with corporate America is
01:11:40.080 socialized costs but privatized profits
01:11:42.679 profits and what you really want is that
01:11:44.719 you want major American companies and
01:11:47.000 I'm like I'm a Believer in the market
01:11:48.560 economy you want them to absorb the
01:11:51.120 benefits but also the costs and that's
01:11:53.159 often what doesn't happen like for
01:11:54.360 example so I talked about this train
01:11:56.199 disaster in East Palestine and you know
01:11:58.560 the railroad companies hate me because I
01:12:00.120 kind of went on a crusade against them
01:12:01.639 afterwards and what I realized is think
01:12:04.480 of all the costs of that disaster think
01:12:07.159 of the health care costs the welfare
01:12:09.440 costs from people who lost their jobs
01:12:11.520 the declining home values in that
01:12:13.120 Community just all of the costs absorbed
01:12:15.600 by that community and the railroads are
01:12:18.080 paying slap on the hand fines and it
01:12:21.000 sort of occurred to me that the reason
01:12:22.719 they're not more serious about these
01:12:24.080 train disasters is because they're
01:12:26.560 privatizing their rewards but when a a
01:12:29.159 major train disaster happens who who
01:12:31.239 picks up the tab it's the local
01:12:33.040 residents and it's the American taxpayer
01:12:35.360 and that's something that fundamentally
01:12:36.560 has to change yeah that has to change
01:12:39.080 and when you're talking about the cost
01:12:41.280 from a place like East Palestine how
01:12:44.360 much can they clean that up like how
01:12:47.920 long does that stay toxic cuz it was
01:12:50.880 millions of gallons right wasn't it some
01:12:53.280 what was the number of gallons gallons
01:12:55.800 but it was a lot and I hate to say the
01:12:57.239 answer your question how much how much
01:12:59.639 can they clean up the answer is I don't
01:13:01.400 know and I actually this is one of my
01:13:04.000 biggest frustrations probably my single
01:13:05.600 biggest frustration uh over my time in
01:13:08.199 the Senate is when this happened a bunch
01:13:11.400 of the residents came to me it's
01:13:14.080 actually very sweet and even kind of
01:13:16.199 patriotic but certainly self-sacrificing
01:13:18.360 where they said look no one knows what
01:13:21.199 the effect of this [ __ ] is going to be
01:13:22.520 15 years down the road right cuz cuz we
01:13:25.239 like we weren't worried about okay a guy
01:13:27.080 drinks the water in East Palestine and
01:13:28.719 drops dead the water levels did not have
01:13:31.960 toxins at that level but the question
01:13:34.560 was what happens when you're em bibbing
01:13:37.639 the stuff breathing it in drinking it at
01:13:39.920 low at Trace levels for 10 15 years like
01:13:42.880 do you have weird diseases down the road
01:13:45.080 hopefully not right I pray every day
01:13:46.719 that hopefully not but you can only
01:13:48.679 study that in the moment and so we
01:13:51.520 actually working with a a public health
01:13:53.719 epidemiologist in North Carolina and
01:13:56.440 some in Ohio we actually came up with a
01:13:58.960 plan like here's what you would need to
01:14:00.880 do you'd collect samples in the first 6
01:14:04.080 months to a year after the disaster and
01:14:05.920 I'm I'm I'm talking about like
01:14:06.960 fingernail clippings things like that
01:14:08.679 you'd establish a baseline of toxins in
01:14:11.520 people's blood and then 5 years later 10
01:14:13.960 years later you try to figure out what
01:14:15.880 the toxins were in people's blood 5
01:14:18.000 years 10 years down the road and then
01:14:19.760 you'd ask yourself what weird diseases
01:14:22.440 if any are people starting to develop at
01:14:25.080 after 5 10 15 years right the long-term
01:14:27.239 health effects of this stuff and it was
01:14:28.880 in some ways a really interesting thing
01:14:31.880 to study because we had never had a
01:14:34.080 chemical disaster where we tried to
01:14:36.000 study the effects of years down the road
01:14:37.880 and of course how much would this cost
01:14:39.840 between 5 and 20 million doll over the
01:14:42.080 whole lifetime of the study we couldn't
01:14:44.080 get Biden Harris we couldn't even get
01:14:46.960 some of my colleagues in the United
01:14:48.239 States Senate to give a [ __ ] and it's
01:14:51.000 really frustrating to me because the
01:14:52.400 time is now passed right all these
01:14:53.960 people who were saying we are
01:14:55.400 volunteering to be a guinea pig to
01:14:57.480 understand the long-term Health
01:14:58.520 consequences the time has passed and
01:15:01.040 we're never going to know because we
01:15:02.600 didn't get the money to do the very
01:15:04.040 small amount of money to do that study
01:15:05.520 then so you asked that question the
01:15:06.960 answer is I don't know I tried like hell
01:15:08.920 to find out do you think that there's
01:15:10.760 someone influencing them to not fund
01:15:13.440 these studies because they don't want
01:15:15.199 responsibility for this bills yeah I
01:15:17.159 thought a lot about that I think in this
01:15:18.480 particular case it was just bureaucratic
01:15:21.080 [ __ ] and too many people being
01:15:23.480 distracted there's a lot of that there's
01:15:25.440 a lot of that right and and and look
01:15:27.000 sometimes to be clear there is outright
01:15:28.800 malevolence there's lobbyists who are in
01:15:30.480 their ear I think with this case it was
01:15:32.600 just you know a bunch of people in rural
01:15:34.560 Ohio that nobody except for you know a
01:15:36.560 few of us I care about them obviously
01:15:38.199 but no person in the in the Harris
01:15:40.280 Administration cared about and so when
01:15:42.480 we went to the White House and just said
01:15:43.840 you could move money like even just give
01:15:46.120 us a couple million dollars to collect
01:15:47.840 the samples and get the study started
01:15:49.760 and then we'll privately fund it down
01:15:51.159 the road we couldn't get anything from
01:15:53.080 them and I think it was just they were
01:15:54.320 like ah we got bigger fish to fry do so
01:15:56.880 do you know what efforts have been made
01:15:59.199 to clean that area up or what actually
01:16:01.880 look we we we've definitely does it show
01:16:04.159 what it
01:16:06.719 is
01:16:08.400 25,800 gallons of TX
01:16:12.040 25,800 what's that that's the car that's
01:16:14.560 the car ID Gall was on it the capacity
01:16:16.440 and the context is 100,000 gallons of
01:16:18.760 that yeah oh each car has oh each car
01:16:22.480 had different stuff yeah each car had
01:16:23.960 different stuff so What's the total of
01:16:26.280 all of it somewhere like that's 100,000
01:16:28.960 that's another like 3 Millions 350,000
01:16:31.440 gallons or
01:16:32.440 so are millions of liters um but look I
01:16:36.760 mean and all that stuff just leaks into
01:16:39.199 the groundwater it goes into a lot
01:16:41.320 people it's a rural are a lot of people
01:16:42.480 are on well water um you know a lot of
01:16:45.280 people are just you know breathing in
01:16:46.440 the air I mean and we don't even know
01:16:48.159 what the health consequences are for
01:16:49.600 those folks for years we we won't know
01:16:51.600 and we we may never really know because
01:16:53.320 we didn't collect the samples at the
01:16:54.600 time because you got to establish the
01:16:55.760 Baseline that was what my epidemiologist
01:16:57.840 guy that I talked to in in um North
01:17:00.600 Carolina said you've got to establish
01:17:02.480 the Baseline because here's what's going
01:17:03.719 to happen right fast forward 10 years
01:17:06.719 people get weird cancers sometimes
01:17:08.400 because of chemical spills come
01:17:09.880 sometimes just because that's human
01:17:10.960 biology somebody will sue the train
01:17:14.679 company which is um uh nor Norfolk I
01:17:18.800 think norfol southern will sue sue the
01:17:21.560 train company and they'll say I've got
01:17:24.280 this weird because of you and what
01:17:26.239 norfol southern will say is no you don't
01:17:28.639 you don't have this weird cancer because
01:17:30.080 of me you have it because of just you
01:17:32.080 know you you sort of lost the game of
01:17:33.960 Russian Roulette that is human biology
01:17:36.480 and what we could have said conclusively
01:17:39.239 was yes or no and unfortunately we're
01:17:41.360 not going to be able to say that this is
01:17:42.920 one of the things like when we're in
01:17:44.679 office the first not the first but the
01:17:47.719 first disaster that we have hopefully
01:17:49.960 there aren't any but there always are
01:17:51.480 First Chemical disaster that we are
01:17:52.920 we're going to take the infrastructure
01:17:54.639 of that study and right away we're going
01:17:56.960 to try to establish a baseline is it
01:17:59.760 possible to I mean is when you when you
01:18:04.600 have a spill of that magnitude can you
01:18:07.120 actually get everything out of the
01:18:08.440 ground do you have to just remove all
01:18:10.120 the ground like how would you you have
01:18:12.120 to test the groundw to make sure that it
01:18:14.239 doesn't to to their credit and you're
01:18:15.679 not going to hear me P pray praising uh
01:18:18.040 the these guys that much but the the
01:18:20.600 local EPA folks I actually think did a
01:18:22.480 pretty good job there on the water side
01:18:24.440 because they basically did is they just
01:18:26.560 ran the water in the Creeks through you
01:18:29.760 know a filtration system cleaned it
01:18:32.480 oxidized it and then got the chemicals
01:18:34.360 out of it and then put it back into the
01:18:35.639 system now the problem is the stuff
01:18:37.840 that's just in the ground you can't
01:18:39.719 really get that out right right you have
01:18:41.760 to remove the ground you'd have to
01:18:43.159 remove the ground and clean I don't even
01:18:44.440 know how you would clean it I don't know
01:18:45.480 if we have the capacity to clean it uh
01:18:47.679 what what you what you can do is try to
01:18:49.639 you know as we did we passed out bottle
01:18:51.239 water and tried to make sure that people
01:18:53.199 weren't drinking the water and until the
01:18:55.440 levels of toxins hit a certain level and
01:18:58.000 again but but the issue was never like
01:19:00.320 the levels of toxins are going to kill
01:19:02.199 you the issue is always are they going
01:19:04.480 to cause long-term problems that is that
01:19:06.800 that we got so focused I think the media
01:19:08.600 got so focused on is the water safe to
01:19:10.920 drink and it's like the question is not
01:19:12.639 is the water safe to drink the question
01:19:14.560 is is the water safe to drink for the
01:19:16.159 next 15 years right and we're never
01:19:18.080 going to know the answer to that
01:19:20.679 question yeah people are terrified of
01:19:22.840 this idea of um someone
01:19:26.520 sabotaging um things like that that have
01:19:30.320 trains to contain toxic chemicals people
01:19:33.000 are terrified about the um sabotaging of
01:19:36.280 the Grid in particular that's that's one
01:19:38.320 that a lot of people have talked about
01:19:40.280 that we we're very vulnerable like what
01:19:42.400 what can be done to sort of Shore that
01:19:45.760 up it seems like cyber attacks are
01:19:47.719 possible physical attacks are possible
01:19:50.400 yeah and if the grid goes down we're we
01:19:52.159 have a real problem right uh we do have
01:19:54.080 a real problem look my you know there's
01:19:56.000 New York Times or somebody else reported
01:19:57.639 recently that my phone was allegedly
01:19:59.239 hacked by Chinese hackers and so oh no
01:20:01.480 what they get yeah uh I don't think
01:20:03.159 anything um nothing come on man I got
01:20:05.520 anything in there we'll find we'll find
01:20:06.960 we'll find out man we'll find out um got
01:20:09.880 any memes you probably should should
01:20:12.120 have share with your friends some some
01:20:14.480 some offensive memes and you know me me
01:20:17.080 telling my wife uh to get an extra
01:20:19.080 gallon of milk at the grocery store I
01:20:20.360 mean I you know luckily I'm a pretty
01:20:22.159 boring guy so I don't think that they
01:20:23.440 got really anything we'll find out it's
01:20:26.159 boring if your phone gets hacked that's
01:20:27.560 right that's right well it also I mean
01:20:30.199 it's apparently they couldn't get the
01:20:31.719 encrypted messages that were in sent so
01:20:33.760 I'm pretty careful about like making
01:20:35.280 sure I use signal and iMessage and all
01:20:37.760 that stuff anyway so I mean look maybe
01:20:40.400 they got some stuff we'll find out
01:20:41.600 eventually I try not to worry too much
01:20:42.840 about [ __ ] I can't control but um one
01:20:45.280 thing that came up by the way in that
01:20:47.000 and I'll get back to your your question
01:20:48.960 is about the grid one thing that came up
01:20:51.120 in that is the way that they hacked and
01:20:53.639 it was also president Trump Trump's
01:20:54.840 phone apparently too the way that they
01:20:56.960 hacked our phones is they used the
01:21:00.400 backdoor Telecom infrastructure that had
01:21:02.880 been developed in the wake of the
01:21:04.679 Patriot Act and this is something that I
01:21:07.080 think should be a much bigger part of
01:21:08.440 the controversy over the Patriot Act is
01:21:10.440 when when the Patriot Act was passed
01:21:11.960 like AT&T Verizon they had to build all
01:21:14.360 of these systems so that if somebody got
01:21:16.360 a fisa warrant and could hack into a
01:21:19.239 particular phone the infrastructure
01:21:21.199 actually existed what I've been told is
01:21:24.159 that that infrastructure was used by
01:21:26.400 this Chinese hacker organization called
01:21:28.159 salt typhoon and that's how they got
01:21:30.120 into to the Verizon network and that's
01:21:32.120 how they got into the AT&T network what
01:21:33.560 a great name by the way salt typhoon
01:21:35.159 it's a pretty badass name right if they
01:21:37.960 have anything on me I can't be too
01:21:39.320 pissed off atam at least they they named
01:21:41.120 themselves salt typhoon but the the
01:21:43.280 answer the question about the grid is
01:21:46.120 this is actually it's one of these
01:21:47.360 things where if we had a functional
01:21:48.800 government it's pretty easy to to
01:21:50.600 develop the systems because if you do
01:21:52.520 like an EMP attack right I Ron Johnson
01:21:55.280 who's a senator from Wisconsin is really
01:21:56.800 preoccupied with this you know it
01:21:58.840 doesn't take down the whole grid what it
01:22:01.800 really screws with is the power
01:22:03.800 transformer system so what we should
01:22:06.120 have is basically a backup power
01:22:08.440 transformer for every major system in
01:22:10.639 the United States of America just
01:22:11.800 sitting in a w Warehouse that's turned
01:22:13.639 off and because it's turned off it won't
01:22:15.639 be affected by an EMP pulse and then if
01:22:17.800 there is an EMP attack you just get
01:22:20.000 those Transformers to swap out the ones
01:22:21.719 that were destroyed and then the grid is
01:22:23.360 back up and running if it's actually a
01:22:25.280 scandal I think that the federal
01:22:26.719 government has not just at one point
01:22:28.520 with all the money that we spend on
01:22:29.760 defense and everything else just said
01:22:31.679 we're going to spend $15 billion to buy
01:22:34.080 enough power Transformers to have a
01:22:35.600 backup for every Transformer in the
01:22:37.080 country we should do that yeah one of
01:22:39.040 the things that Trump talked about that
01:22:40.880 a lot of people probably weren't aware
01:22:42.760 of was the damage that these wind
01:22:45.800 turbines are doing to whales I wasn't
01:22:49.440 totally aware of it I I had no idea
01:22:51.639 until I watched your podcast with him I
01:22:53.840 knew a little bit about it but I I
01:22:56.080 didn't read about it until after I
01:22:57.960 talked to him it's a real problem it's a
01:23:00.280 very real problem and what a conundrum
01:23:02.960 for people that are so-called
01:23:04.040 environmentalists that think that wind
01:23:05.560 is like this the cleanest option when
01:23:08.440 it's not the turbines don't last you
01:23:11.280 can't recycle them it doesn't work in
01:23:13.040 salt water in particular which is what
01:23:14.840 most of the world's water is I think
01:23:17.480 wind is the biggest scam out there it's
01:23:20.760 total [ __ ] it's also pollution when
01:23:23.840 I see those gigantic wind they're ugly
01:23:26.800 they're gross they're ugly I mean I I
01:23:29.440 thought this uh where where were me and
01:23:31.400 my wife we used to be in road trips
01:23:33.280 before we had a secret service detail
01:23:35.080 and we took a road trip the good old
01:23:36.880 days man we took a road trip through
01:23:39.280 Kansas or Nebraska maybe it was Iowa um
01:23:43.880 it was it was one of the I mean we went
01:23:46.080 through all three of those States but I
01:23:47.320 can't remember where you just go for
01:23:49.320 miles and miles and you see nothing but
01:23:52.040 wind turbin and it's like this is
01:23:53.719 beautiful American Countryside that used
01:23:56.040 to be green Rolling Hills and now you
01:23:58.400 have these disgusting dystopian wi
01:24:00.280 turbines I'm sorry they are ugly I will
01:24:03.040 die on this hill they're ugly I don't
01:24:05.280 want them in American society and
01:24:07.199 nuclear power plants are actually more
01:24:09.239 efficient safer and you don't have the
01:24:12.000 problem like we think about the problems
01:24:13.480 of nuclear waste like they've kind of
01:24:15.520 sorted a lot of those out they haven't
01:24:17.400 sorted out the problems of getting rid
01:24:18.840 of these turbines no they haven't not at
01:24:20.360 all I I have a buddy of mine who lives
01:24:21.679 in South Texas and I went to visit him
01:24:23.480 and you you drive down there and it's
01:24:25.360 like an hour of turbines they're
01:24:27.880 everywhere there's so many of you just
01:24:30.560 see them as like the sky is turning dark
01:24:32.840 you see these things just spinning it
01:24:34.639 just looks gross they kill the birds
01:24:36.960 they apparently kill the wh kill a lot
01:24:38.920 of birds if you look underneath them
01:24:40.440 it's like bird graveyards it's crazy
01:24:42.719 yeah it really is and it's clean it's
01:24:44.800 green it's like we're we're brainwashed
01:24:47.920 to think that these things somehow or
01:24:50.400 another are beneficial cuz they're
01:24:51.800 attached to this idea of being
01:24:53.080 environmentally conscious and I got I I
01:24:55.159 I got the thought behind them right I
01:24:56.880 understand why we were trying to turn
01:24:58.239 that's obviously a source of energy cuz
01:24:59.840 you have wind blowing through that's
01:25:01.159 energy that we should capture but we're
01:25:03.199 just not that good at it with this right
01:25:05.000 maybe efficient right just accept that
01:25:06.840 it was a mistake it's not that efficient
01:25:08.760 the political or the environmental costs
01:25:10.760 are pretty significant you know solar I
01:25:13.639 I think is actually a little bit more
01:25:15.320 reasonable because you can get a lot
01:25:16.880 more of the power they last a little bit
01:25:19.119 longer they're not nearly as ugly and
01:25:21.040 you can put them in places where people
01:25:22.600 don't frankly want to live that much
01:25:23.880 anyway like like in deserts and things
01:25:25.239 like that well they do those roofs now
01:25:27.199 like Tesla does solar roof the solar
01:25:29.440 roof I think that's a great way right
01:25:31.159 that's just empty space but wind I think
01:25:33.639 we just should say this was a failed
01:25:35.280 experiment we're going to stop
01:25:36.560 subsidizing this and if people want to
01:25:38.159 have a wind turbine great but we're not
01:25:40.080 going to build miles and miles of wind
01:25:42.080 turbines anymore at least not with
01:25:43.840 taxpayer subsidy but I I just hope
01:25:46.239 people recognize that the tradeoff is
01:25:48.600 not worth it like you're getting a
01:25:50.199 little bit of electricity you're really
01:25:52.040 ruining the landscape you're ruining the
01:25:53.800 view you're killing birds you're messing
01:25:56.159 up whales and those things don't last
01:25:58.719 that long and then you got to get rid of
01:26:00.040 them you got to put them in a landfill
01:26:01.360 like the whole thing's bananas it's
01:26:02.960 totally bananas and again it's we focus
01:26:05.840 on the carbon footprint thing and we
01:26:07.800 don't talk about the fact that there are
01:26:09.119 these massive environmental hazards that
01:26:10.760 goes back to the distracted politics
01:26:12.480 versus the real stuff and we should be
01:26:14.440 talking about the real environmental
01:26:15.679 consequences of also no it's one of
01:26:18.960 those things that again is much like a
01:26:20.480 religion where you you must stay with
01:26:23.560 the doctrine you must you must follow it
01:26:26.360 by the word because if you step out of
01:26:28.920 line and say actually when you look at
01:26:31.840 these studies it doesn't really show
01:26:34.119 that the world is warming it shows that
01:26:36.119 over the last x amount of thousands of
01:26:37.840 years we're in a gradual cooling period
01:26:41.119 and that what's really terrifying is
01:26:42.840 global cooling yes you know Randall
01:26:44.760 Carlson who's an expert in uh asteroid
01:26:47.119 collisions and the younger D impact
01:26:49.080 Theory fascinating guy but he says that
01:26:51.960 like the periods the periods in in
01:26:54.520 history where we came very close to
01:26:56.159 extinction are like when there's an Ice
01:26:58.239 Age yes like those are the most
01:26:59.960 terrifying that's right when there's
01:27:01.440 global warming you just move to where
01:27:04.239 it's not so warm and that's what people
01:27:06.360 have done forever well and you and you
01:27:08.440 deal with it technologically right this
01:27:10.280 is the thing that the solution to global
01:27:12.280 warming for however long this warming
01:27:14.239 Trends Trend lasts is to deal with it
01:27:16.840 technologically right if you look at the
01:27:18.920 number of people who die from disasters
01:27:21.239 in the United States it's going down
01:27:23.719 because we've gotten better at
01:27:24.800 predicting stuff and helping people deal
01:27:26.560 with things and of course you still have
01:27:28.199 terrible things like hurricane Helen but
01:27:31.119 they are luckily part of a downward
01:27:32.960 Trend and people losing their lives from
01:27:35.119 terrible storms and you know if if you
01:27:37.800 really think like if you really think
01:27:39.560 that carbon this is another reason why
01:27:41.360 I'm somewhat skeptical of like the
01:27:42.840 carbon obsessives is if you think that
01:27:45.119 carbon is the most significant thing the
01:27:49.440 the sole focus of American civilization
01:27:52.600 should be to reduce the carbon foot of
01:27:54.480 the world then you would be investing in
01:27:56.639 nuclear in a big way and then when you
01:27:58.600 say that the environmentalists say well
01:28:00.360 you've got all these poison rocks to
01:28:01.520 deal with afterwards well the poison
01:28:03.520 rocks problem is a less significant
01:28:05.600 problem than the carbon problem if you
01:28:07.560 think that we're all going to go extinct
01:28:08.760 in 100 years so let's deal with the most
01:28:11.320 pressing problem they're all like no no
01:28:12.600 no no and their solution is to buy solar
01:28:16.960 panels that are disproportionately made
01:28:18.800 in China which has the worst carbon
01:28:20.960 footprint and growing of any country in
01:28:23.320 the entire world
01:28:24.639 they obviously don't believe their own
01:28:26.040 [ __ ] which is why I'm somewhat
01:28:27.360 skeptical of what they say also when you
01:28:29.639 have a movement and your spokesperson is
01:28:31.920 Greta thurnberg and not some insanely
01:28:35.480 intelligent scientist who''s done years
01:28:37.639 of research on this stuff and there's
01:28:39.639 also not a consensus among scientists
01:28:42.000 there's a lot of scientists that are
01:28:43.520 Heretics that are stepping outside the
01:28:45.040 lines that are saying that this is not
01:28:46.840 an issue and then they're also pointing
01:28:48.440 out the fact that carbon is what trees
01:28:51.239 consume and there's more Greenery in the
01:28:54.119 world today than there was 100 years ago
01:28:56.360 which is a very inconvenient thing for
01:28:58.199 people see I didn't realize that yeah I
01:29:00.239 had no idea that's true well carbon is
01:29:02.080 what trees feed off so I knew carbon is
01:29:04.360 what trees feed off of I didn't know
01:29:06.080 there was more Greenery than there was
01:29:07.480 100 years ago that's that's interesting
01:29:09.040 not only that you got Bill Gates that's
01:29:10.679 saying planting trees is not a solution
01:29:13.239 to the carbon problem like wait a second
01:29:15.639 this is this is so not true it's so not
01:29:18.960 true and it's also historically like one
01:29:21.760 of the the the craziest in history in my
01:29:25.040 opinion is the Mongols and what the
01:29:27.040 Mongols did in the 1200s they lowered
01:29:30.159 the carbon footprint of Earth because
01:29:32.880 they killed so many people they killed
01:29:34.800 10% of the population of Earth that that
01:29:37.719 is crazy and because of that because
01:29:40.400 they they devastated these places and
01:29:43.199 killed so many people trees grew more
01:29:46.159 trees grew and it lowered the carbon
01:29:48.480 foot these places that had been overcome
01:29:50.480 by agriculture were then Rec consumed by
01:29:52.679 nature and it lowered the carbon
01:29:55.199 footprint of Earth well there is a
01:29:56.960 fundamentally it raises the point
01:29:58.560 there's a fundamentally anti-human
01:30:00.199 element of the radical environmental
01:30:01.840 movement in the United States of America
01:30:03.520 they're saying we have to reduce
01:30:04.440 population this is one and when they say
01:30:06.400 it with vaccines you're like slow down
01:30:09.239 that's right did you just say that all
01:30:11.199 loud [ __ ] yes and then when you if you
01:30:13.679 read Robert F Kennedy's Jr and I
01:30:15.440 encourage everyone to read Robert F
01:30:17.600 Kennedy Junior's book the real Anthony
01:30:19.360 fouchy because it's not just about this
01:30:23.440 crisis that we went through with
01:30:24.639 covid-19 it's about a a host of
01:30:27.639 different things that were done and one
01:30:30.199 of them was a vaccine That was supposed
01:30:32.840 to be a DPT vaccine that they were
01:30:34.960 giving to girls in Africa that was just
01:30:38.400 birth control it was just sterilizing
01:30:41.000 them wow and that they were I didn't
01:30:43.080 realize they were giving them HCG and
01:30:45.719 that they were giving them this uh
01:30:47.280 enhanced schedule I don't want to screw
01:30:49.080 this up because my recall is not the
01:30:51.040 best I don't want to but the reality is
01:30:54.000 there was experiments done on unwitting
01:30:56.920 unknowing African women where they gave
01:30:59.520 them this thing that was supposed to be
01:31:01.400 a vaccine against a disease but it was
01:31:03.400 really sterilizing them and they're
01:31:05.600 experimenting dark again that's that's
01:31:07.760 like the Native American oxycon thing
01:31:10.400 Global Health [ __ ] like there's a lot of
01:31:13.080 experimenting going on that's right
01:31:15.239 that's what's they we we pulled up an AP
01:31:17.199 article I had Alex Jones telling me this
01:31:18.920 I was like what it's like they gave him
01:31:20.159 polio they TR the vaccine they gave him
01:31:22.000 polio like what so
01:31:25.280 AP article that shows that a lot of they
01:31:28.560 had to stop giving these kids in Africa
01:31:30.679 this polio vaccine because it was
01:31:32.320 actually giving them polio that's crazy
01:31:34.880 like because they experiment because
01:31:36.639 this is how they find out if stuff works
01:31:38.239 so you get people with no internet
01:31:39.639 connection they live in dirt floors
01:31:41.360 we're going to help you and then they
01:31:42.880 come in they experiment on them and it's
01:31:45.199 so dark that is so dark and it's all
01:31:47.560 done through this idea of philanthropy
01:31:49.520 yeah yeah and it's crazy and they profit
01:31:52.360 off of it the whole thing is Madness and
01:31:55.280 because they have so much influence and
01:31:58.679 so much power and so much money is being
01:32:00.400 generated they're allowed to get away
01:32:01.560 with these things just think about like
01:32:03.080 that from the perspective of these poor
01:32:04.679 people I I assume the polio vaccine
01:32:06.600 thing happened in Africa or it happened
01:32:07.960 somewhere else so okay so you're in
01:32:09.080 Africa some white dude shows up says
01:32:11.719 that he cares about you gives you a shot
01:32:14.000 that's going to you know prevent you
01:32:15.480 from getting some disease and then you
01:32:17.239 become like permanently disabled or you
01:32:19.360 even die because of it like think about
01:32:21.320 what effect that has on how those
01:32:24.000 Africans perceive our civilization and
01:32:27.679 are we going to have you know are they
01:32:28.800 going to like we're going to have a
01:32:31.040 conflict in 3040 years because people
01:32:32.880 are so pissed off about us coming in and
01:32:35.840 and giving them health care that isn't
01:32:37.400 actually health care I really worry
01:32:39.119 about that stuff I mean this is one of
01:32:40.320 my big things with the Russia Ukraine
01:32:41.800 conflict is people don't realize how
01:32:43.400 much of Africa's food supply comes from
01:32:45.199 the Ukraine like a an astonishing amount
01:32:47.960 so if you have this war that goes on
01:32:50.920 forever and there's not enough food
01:32:53.400 going to Africa are are you going to
01:32:55.400 have a bunch of starving desperate
01:32:57.320 people who are like pissed off because
01:32:59.440 they're starving who hate European
01:33:02.320 civilization because they don't have you
01:33:04.639 know they're not getting the food that
01:33:05.800 they were expecting to get like we never
01:33:07.960 think about the KnockOn effects of this
01:33:09.440 stuff right you're like yeah it's really
01:33:11.280 dark and really evil that we're giving
01:33:12.600 them Polio I also wonder the people who
01:33:15.360 live in the village that got polio what
01:33:16.960 the hell are they going to be doing in
01:33:18.080 30 years they're probably going to hate
01:33:19.560 us yeah I would be really upset if you
01:33:22.159 gave my kid polio over here justifiably
01:33:25.199 so justifiably so I'd hate these people
01:33:27.400 right you give my kid polio under the
01:33:29.080 pretense of helping them it's crazy but
01:33:31.920 you know then there's also
01:33:32.840 pharmaceutical drugs that are really
01:33:34.159 beneficial and this is the thing like
01:33:35.320 they have to have guard rails yeah you
01:33:36.760 have to have some ril and regulations to
01:33:39.600 keep these people from just NeverEnding
01:33:41.560 profits cuz they always gravitate
01:33:43.719 towards that they always gravitate
01:33:44.920 towards making the most amount of money
01:33:46.480 and again this is where I go back to
01:33:47.760 some of the arguments of the old left
01:33:49.199 like what kind of guard rails do you
01:33:50.600 want these companies to have do you want
01:33:52.520 the guard rails to be that if donate to
01:33:54.520 the trans pride and BLM organizations
01:33:56.960 you get to do whatever the hell you want
01:33:58.760 or do you want the guard rails like
01:33:59.760 we're going to protect health and Public
01:34:01.520 Safety and make sure that you're not
01:34:03.600 like killing people under the ospice of
01:34:06.040 helping them yeah and that that's the
01:34:08.199 kind of guard rails I want the com
01:34:10.239 logical yeah very logical but logic is
01:34:14.040 you know dangerous today
01:34:17.000 like logic oh man logic is uh it's it's
01:34:20.960 a problem when you have ideology and
01:34:22.719 people strictly logic is a colonial idea
01:34:25.199 man you got to get away from the logic
01:34:26.679 that's math is racist I don't that
01:34:29.040 that's a new one well okay so this is
01:34:32.639 interesting there's this movie that's
01:34:35.040 probably like extremely influential to
01:34:36.800 my entire political worldview and I
01:34:38.159 didn't realize until last night cuz I
01:34:39.840 got into Austin late usually my wife
01:34:41.480 travels with me she wasn't with me last
01:34:43.480 night she's taking care of the kids
01:34:44.440 today so I get I get in the hotel room
01:34:47.199 in Austin and it's very late and I watch
01:34:49.719 this movie boys in the hood have you
01:34:51.000 ever seen boys in the hood oh yeah sure
01:34:52.520 okay I watched that movie a ton when I
01:34:55.000 was like 8 n years old and I didn't
01:34:57.760 realize how much that movie has had an
01:35:00.679 influence on me until I watched it last
01:35:02.159 night okay so all right Furious Styles a
01:35:06.040 lot of his stuff about not letting
01:35:08.760 financial institutions buy up all the
01:35:11.320 stuff in your community obviously he's
01:35:12.880 talking about black people in LA and not
01:35:14.600 you know white people in you know rural
01:35:16.480 small town America but I was like oh
01:35:18.639 like that's that's maybe the first place
01:35:20.719 that I ever heard this idea or he talks
01:35:22.400 about like the importance of Father Hood
01:35:24.080 the importance of especially young boys
01:35:26.360 having a father in the home it's like I
01:35:28.480 got that from boys in the hood and
01:35:29.639 obviously it spoke to me when I was a
01:35:30.920 kid because I grew up at the time and I
01:35:32.360 didn't have my much of a relationship
01:35:33.639 with my dad and it's it's interesting
01:35:36.199 man he makes this observation math being
01:35:38.280 racist he's criticizing the SAT for
01:35:41.440 being culturally biased but then he says
01:35:43.480 the only part that isn't culturally
01:35:44.679 biased is the
01:35:45.800 math and it's like oh this is like a
01:35:49.040 black nationalist in the mid 80s cuz
01:35:51.520 that's that's kind of the philosophy of
01:35:52.960 this movie as what you might call like
01:35:54.400 old school black leftism this movie in
01:35:57.520 the 1980s is saying something that I I
01:35:59.880 wish a lot of white liberals would hear
01:36:01.880 today which is actually math is not
01:36:03.560 racist
01:36:05.000 it's it's one of the things that's like
01:36:07.040 not def definitively not racist is math
01:36:10.440 and numbers you guys are losing your
01:36:11.960 damn Minds well math is racist is one of
01:36:14.199 those ones where you it's like if you
01:36:15.719 heard that in a cocktail party you'd be
01:36:17.600 like what like if someone behind you was
01:36:20.400 saying math is racist you'd be like what
01:36:21.920 the we got to get out of here honey
01:36:24.560 I'd say I want to go I want one of what
01:36:26.360 they're having I want to hang out with
01:36:27.639 those guys that's so okay by the way
01:36:30.920 this is my the you know an active
01:36:33.320 bipartisanship the one thing that
01:36:35.600 Republicans man that were really I think
01:36:38.199 we got really wrong in the last few
01:36:39.719 years is the anti- hunter Biden stuff I
01:36:42.840 want to go hang out with Hunter
01:36:45.119 Biden I mean I may the only Republican
01:36:48.320 that dude that dude he was like H Thom
01:36:51.960 without the writing Talent
01:36:55.239 that guy went hard you got to give it to
01:36:57.480 him I would bet I would bet $100 than
01:36:59.760 Hunter Biden is voting for Donald Trump
01:37:01.159 for president it well it doesn't seem
01:37:02.960 like he likes his dad it seems like he
01:37:05.600 his dad I might I might bet $20 on his
01:37:07.679 dad voting for Donald Trump for
01:37:09.040 president last night after the garbage
01:37:11.000 comment yeah uh you know that guy is
01:37:13.360 trying to help Donald Trump you're we're
01:37:17.679 going to win I think we're going to win
01:37:19.080 but after we win I'm going to be
01:37:20.639 convinced that Joe Biden was trying to
01:37:21.880 help us the whole time mag hat the Maga
01:37:24.560 hat was crazy that was crazy when he put
01:37:26.239 on the Maga hat in front of those guys
01:37:27.639 and they all cheered and he insisted on
01:37:29.800 keeping the hat and he took it with him
01:37:31.920 I think he's very very resentful that he
01:37:34.960 got ousted in what was essentially a
01:37:36.760 coup yeah and and I'd love to know what
01:37:39.000 what happened there by way I would love
01:37:40.560 to know what happen I have to use the
01:37:41.599 restroom we come back let's talk about
01:37:43.360 that because this important I just have
01:37:44.920 to PE be right back so the the the
01:37:48.920 wildest thing about the laptop was that
01:37:51.679 they were able to suppress it from
01:37:53.119 social media and wild when I discussed
01:37:56.639 that with Zuckerberg and he openly
01:37:59.280 admitted it that the FBI had contacted
01:38:01.199 him and told him that it was Russian
01:38:02.480 disinformation and like that was one of
01:38:04.400 those things while he was saying I was
01:38:05.599 like yo I was like this guy's like just
01:38:07.639 saying this yeah and I remember when
01:38:09.760 that episode came out because it like it
01:38:12.440 reverberated across American politics
01:38:14.679 like crazy holy [ __ ] he just said the
01:38:17.320 thing that we all suspected for a very
01:38:19.000 long time and if it wasn't for Elon
01:38:21.560 purchasing Twitter and then and finding
01:38:24.679 out how much of an influence they were
01:38:26.560 having on this and that they were in
01:38:29.480 fact silencing something that they knew
01:38:31.480 to be correct under a lie under a lie
01:38:34.119 and 51 Former Intelligence agents signed
01:38:36.280 off on this right who's like how did you
01:38:39.239 how did they pull that off like just
01:38:40.920 pulling pulling that off is really wild
01:38:43.560 and the fact that there was no outrage
01:38:45.199 from the left that the left was like
01:38:47.800 it's fine because it's our side and
01:38:49.679 Trump is evil and he's Hitler we got to
01:38:51.520 get rid of him so let's just lie about
01:38:53.960 this laptop and no consequences nothing
01:38:56.599 right the same people that pushed it are
01:38:58.000 still by they still all have security
01:38:59.480 clearances I believe which is going to
01:39:01.000 change when we win but um I mean also
01:39:05.520 this is this is where I always get
01:39:07.599 pissed about the media conversation
01:39:10.159 around what happened in 2020 is what
01:39:13.520 they'll do is they'll they'll they'll
01:39:14.960 sort of find the craziest conspiracy
01:39:17.199 theory about what happened in 2020
01:39:19.719 they'll debunk it and say oh look this
01:39:21.719 this thing we this shows that nothing
01:39:23.840 bad happened in 2020 there's a
01:39:25.560 nonpartisan organization that actually
01:39:27.080 looked at what would have happened to
01:39:29.040 Americans votes if they had just known
01:39:31.800 the truth about the fact that Joe Biden
01:39:33.719 fundamentally had traded his political
01:39:35.800 influence for money like that's what it
01:39:37.040 was it's it's it's an old-fashioned
01:39:38.719 American corruption story I will give
01:39:40.599 you access to powerful people in
01:39:42.280 exchange for money right that was the
01:39:44.400 true Scandal of the hunter Biden laptop
01:39:46.239 again it wasn't Hunter Biden doing
01:39:47.599 cocaine with a stripper that was the fun
01:39:49.360 part you can say
01:39:51.760 that I have an election went um
01:39:55.960 so that was the real SC corrup it was
01:39:58.639 the corruption
01:40:00.520 and and and and direct evidence the the
01:40:03.080 corruption and a nonpartisan or
01:40:04.639 organization said that knowledge which
01:40:07.800 was suppressed by the entire American
01:40:10.480 Media and big Tech scene that would have
01:40:13.239 changed Millions upon millions of votes
01:40:15.199 and we know that the number in four
01:40:17.080 swing States was 88,000 votes that were
01:40:19.440 the difference between Donald Trump and
01:40:21.560 Joe Biden winning the 2020 election so
01:40:23.679 set to the side all of the other
01:40:24.920 arguments about fraud and all the other
01:40:26.360 rule changes that happened in the midst
01:40:27.840 of Co we know that big Tech colluded
01:40:31.639 with our own sort of I would say
01:40:34.320 colluded the one thing I'll say about
01:40:36.040 Zuckerberg is and I like I don't know
01:40:38.040 him super well I've never had a problem
01:40:39.800 with them but I do wonder if it's a
01:40:41.679 convenient excuse I don't doubt that the
01:40:44.199 FBI said hey this is Russian
01:40:45.679 disinformation but these companies still
01:40:47.480 have to take some agency over this too
01:40:49.119 right so I think it was both the
01:40:50.040 corruption of the FBI and the
01:40:51.440 intelligence services but also the big
01:40:53.400 technology companies themselves both of
01:40:55.679 them are at blame and I think
01:40:57.280 fundamentally if they had not done what
01:40:59.440 they did Donald Trump would have won
01:41:01.040 another term as president United States
01:41:03.159 you you're never going to be able to
01:41:04.239 convince me that if Millions upon
01:41:06.280 millions of Swing voters knew the
01:41:08.440 evidence of Joe Biden's corruption and
01:41:10.320 it was staring them in the face that we
01:41:12.440 would not have been able to to pull that
01:41:14.199 one out well Zuckerberg has gotten
01:41:16.760 really into mixed martial arts he's
01:41:19.199 gotten really into jiujitsu and really
01:41:21.599 into training and there's very few
01:41:24.520 things that will turn you into a
01:41:26.040 conservative more than martial arts
01:41:29.400 training like every there's no way to
01:41:32.880 get ahead other than hard work well have
01:41:34.719 you seen all these studies um that
01:41:37.400 basically connect testosterone levels
01:41:39.719 and young men with conservative politics
01:41:42.199 oh yeah yeah so maybe that's what's
01:41:44.000 going on well it's there's a certain
01:41:46.440 amount maybe that's why the Democrats
01:41:47.719 want us all to be you know poor health
01:41:50.599 and overweight is because that means
01:41:52.880 they going to be no it means we're going
01:41:54.280 to be more liberal right if you if you
01:41:56.239 make people less healthy they apparently
01:41:58.960 become more politically liberal that's
01:42:01.320 an interesting observation well I think
01:42:04.119 there's like socially liberal like Live
01:42:07.320 and Let Live do whatever you want as
01:42:08.960 long as you're not hurting anybody which
01:42:10.400 is really what I am and then the reality
01:42:14.800 yeah these labels get all confused right
01:42:16.360 yeah and this is where it gets sort of
01:42:18.760 conflated like the reality of hard work
01:42:20.920 being a virtue yes and this has always
01:42:22.800 been a conservative idea is that you're
01:42:25.480 really supposed to like make your mark
01:42:27.040 in this world and get up in the morning
01:42:29.320 and work hard and you should be proud of
01:42:31.239 that yes the only way to get good at
01:42:33.040 Jiu-Jitsu is hard work yes so everybody
01:42:35.679 who really trains hard and gets good has
01:42:39.280 a certain level of a just a true
01:42:42.199 understanding of the real relationship
01:42:44.920 that the actual the mathematical
01:42:47.360 equation of focus time energy and
01:42:50.080 discipline versus positive results and
01:42:52.599 there's only one way to excel there's no
01:42:54.840 other way to excel at martial arts other
01:42:56.800 than training hard so it's kind of
01:42:58.920 normal that he's becoming like leaning
01:43:00.719 more libertarian and wearing hoodies now
01:43:03.840 yeah no my my my secret jacked my secret
01:43:06.520 theory is is that Zuck is now a trump
01:43:08.960 supporter but he can't say that publicly
01:43:10.880 of course but um hopefully he is really
01:43:14.639 difficult to say that now that's why
01:43:15.840 guys like Bill Amman and chamath and all
01:43:18.560 these people that stand out it's taking
01:43:20.119 real courage it has yeah and I I like
01:43:22.639 both of those guys they really do get
01:43:25.000 excommunicated absolutely they yeah
01:43:27.040 cocktail parties are a mess after that
01:43:28.599 in M
01:43:31.320 County they think you're a Nazi and
01:43:33.880 that's that's putting it mildly but yeah
01:43:35.239 I mean like you know one of my closest
01:43:36.320 friends in the tech world is David Sachs
01:43:38.360 and Dave and I have talked about this
01:43:39.360 because we were both like it's it's
01:43:40.440 funny we were both sort of critical of
01:43:42.159 trump in 2016 but we came you know at
01:43:44.360 that criticism from a ride to Center
01:43:46.000 perspective and both of us by 2020 were
01:43:48.960 like this crazy [ __ ] has to end
01:43:51.560 Trump is our guy and maybe not only is
01:43:53.639 he our guy but maybe he was like the
01:43:55.080 only one who could have turned the tide
01:43:58.080 against this insanity and David I mean
01:44:01.840 he has become so far out there and I
01:44:04.840 admire it in a lot of ways but then
01:44:06.199 sometimes I see what David says and I'm
01:44:07.639 like dude are you going to be like
01:44:09.400 welcome in what is he say in your
01:44:12.199 neighborhood well I mean have you ever
01:44:14.000 interviewed David sax well I mean he's
01:44:16.280 he's just look he's he's very anti-woke
01:44:19.480 he's very very into foreign what I would
01:44:22.560 call foreign policy realism like why are
01:44:24.639 we starting these stupid Wars all over
01:44:26.119 the world we should be our foreign
01:44:27.560 policy should be more pro peace and it
01:44:30.000 it's just crazy to me because he's he's
01:44:31.679 so inflammatory about it that I'm and by
01:44:35.280 the way I love it right I you know I
01:44:37.360 agree with with what a lot of what David
01:44:39.119 says and even when I disagree I know
01:44:40.280 he's a smart guy but he is just saying
01:44:42.920 look I don't give a [ __ ] if you're going
01:44:44.679 to come after me come after me but I'm
01:44:46.760 going to say what's on my mind and I
01:44:48.360 think you know a lot of people are going
01:44:50.000 in that direction which is fundamentally
01:44:51.599 a good thing is is people are sick of
01:44:54.679 being told what to think and like the
01:44:56.360 first amendment obviously it's a it's a
01:44:58.880 legal document that talks about the role
01:45:01.719 of government in censorship and sort of
01:45:03.719 prohibits government censorship but it's
01:45:05.719 also a sort of ethic and an attitude
01:45:08.320 that is in demic or I hope is to
01:45:11.599 American society which is we're going to
01:45:14.000 think what we want we're going to say
01:45:15.320 what we want to that's an important
01:45:17.080 First Amendment value even though it has
01:45:18.840 nothing to do with the First Amendment
01:45:20.199 as a legal document itself and a lot of
01:45:22.280 people are sick of being told what to
01:45:23.599 think I was very upset when Tim wal was
01:45:26.480 saying that the First Amendment doesn't
01:45:28.760 apply to hate speech and misinformation
01:45:32.199 like especially those two terms hate
01:45:35.119 speech and misinformation because hate
01:45:37.239 spech they in the eye of the beholder
01:45:38.639 right it's so subjective and it's the
01:45:40.760 the the the marks are moving as to
01:45:43.280 what's called hate speech now it's
01:45:44.960 moving further and further away from
01:45:46.599 normal say that an 11-year-old should
01:45:48.199 not get gender transition drugs that is
01:45:50.320 hate speech according to a significant
01:45:52.400 subset of left yeah if you call Caitlyn
01:45:54.480 Jenner Bruce Jenner that's hate speech a
01:45:56.280 lot of people would say that's hate
01:45:57.400 speech and you used to get banned for
01:45:59.199 life from Twitter for dead naming
01:46:01.679 someone yes which is just bananas which
01:46:04.119 is totally Banas calling you can call
01:46:05.560 him a [ __ ] but you you can't you can't
01:46:08.480 call him Bruce the whole thing is so
01:46:11.440 crazy it's just it and but it like I I
01:46:15.920 think that this is and look I'm try not
01:46:18.400 to be too partisan cuz I know a lot of
01:46:20.159 people watch your show but this is to me
01:46:22.360 the biggest the most fundamental
01:46:23.639 difference between Kamala and president
01:46:25.679 Trump in the campaign is you know
01:46:28.480 whether it's Biden calling people
01:46:30.320 garbage or Tim walz calling people
01:46:32.360 fascist and kamla calling people Nazis
01:46:35.480 or endorsing explicit censorship we're
01:46:38.599 not trying to censor our fellow
01:46:40.800 Americans right we'll Tac comma and our
01:46:42.760 policies and our ideas but we're not
01:46:44.239 trying to say you should be silenced
01:46:46.239 because you disagree with us that is
01:46:48.480 anathema to everything that I believe in
01:46:51.520 and that is what's happen in the in the
01:46:53.360 modern democratic party at least at the
01:46:55.040 leadership level is they've gotten
01:46:56.760 really comfortable with the idea of
01:46:58.960 silencing people who disagree with them
01:47:00.880 such to the point where like it's not
01:47:02.239 even that Tim Waltz thinks that hate
01:47:04.400 speech should be censored it's that the
01:47:06.960 governor of a state could utter that
01:47:08.880 phrase without recognizing how
01:47:10.400 fundamentally subjective it is right
01:47:12.480 we're or Hillary Clinton saying that we
01:47:14.199 want to censor misinformation she has
01:47:16.400 come out and explicitly said that we
01:47:17.880 have to censor disinformation and L
01:47:20.880 total control or we like hey you're not
01:47:23.840 supposed to have
01:47:25.760 control that's the whole point is you
01:47:27.599 don't want people to have total control
01:47:29.520 and they they can utter it without the
01:47:31.719 American Media going completely bananas
01:47:36.119 just suggests there's something broken
01:47:37.840 about the political culture of the left
01:47:39.560 I mean there are people on CNN and you
01:47:41.880 know CBS and all these other sort of
01:47:43.520 mainstream networks i' would call them
01:47:45.440 corporate networks all these corporate
01:47:47.679 networks that will say you know when
01:47:49.639 Donald J Trump says that if you riot
01:47:52.639 after after the election you're the
01:47:53.719 enemy of the people or you're an enemy
01:47:55.639 within like that is a major threat to
01:47:57.800 democracy but Hillary Clinton is saying
01:47:59.880 that we should censor disinformation
01:48:01.520 they're just yeah no no big deal and the
01:48:04.679 fact that they can get so fired up about
01:48:07.040 what I think is a pretty Common Sense
01:48:08.400 observation that if you Riot law
01:48:10.280 enforcement should have a response to it
01:48:12.199 but they think that it's the end of the
01:48:14.679 they don't care at all don't care at all
01:48:17.040 when Hillary Clinton and Tim WS Endor
01:48:18.719 explicit censorship that should scare
01:48:20.880 the hell out of us it should scare the
01:48:22.920 out of you whenever any politician is
01:48:25.159 encouraging censorship especially when
01:48:27.599 it's about things like we said about
01:48:29.520 hate speech and misinformation like
01:48:31.280 misinformation according to who because
01:48:33.639 we've already shown that
01:48:37.080 there's there's a bunch of different
01:48:39.440 factors that have control over what is
01:48:42.560 presented as fact yes and they're not
01:48:45.119 always honest or accurate and these
01:48:47.639 things get put out and it harms people
01:48:50.040 and then there's some sort of a
01:48:51.040 correction that comes along well the
01:48:52.360 only way find that out especially like
01:48:54.159 during the covid times these things that
01:48:56.239 they called misinformation how many of
01:48:58.400 them turned out to be true almost all of
01:49:00.679 them it's crazy the Wuhan lab it was
01:49:03.199 racist racist to assume that the when
01:49:06.599 John Stewart did that bit on Co bear did
01:49:08.800 you see that I have never seen it though
01:49:10.520 it's amazing CU you see coar scrambling
01:49:14.280 and he's trying to like John's like do
01:49:16.560 you think maybe the lab that was the
01:49:20.040 Wuhan Corona virus lab lab that like
01:49:24.480 maybe it came from there like it was it
01:49:26.520 was so obvious I mean the the whole
01:49:28.320 argument for the start of Co that wasn't
01:49:30.719 from the Wuhan lab was basically As I
01:49:32.840 understood it that a bat had gotten a
01:49:35.639 weird Corona virus and had like fallen
01:49:38.119 into a guy's soup at a wet you know a
01:49:41.880 was involved there so much stupidity
01:49:44.159 involved and that's like that was more
01:49:45.679 believable than there's the Wuhan Corona
01:49:48.280 virus lab and yeah I I remember when you
01:49:50.119 Tom Cotton was the first major American
01:49:52.239 politician to talk about this you know
01:49:53.960 Tom's like a good friend and he was
01:49:56.520 immediately pillared as this terrible
01:49:58.840 racist and you know it's just it's
01:50:03.000 bizarre that we're not allowed to talk
01:50:05.119 about things in the United States of
01:50:06.679 America I will say I think it's gotten
01:50:08.239 better this is one of my more optimistic
01:50:10.480 views is you know when we were all
01:50:12.360 locked in our houses in the summer of
01:50:14.320 2020 I think that did weird things
01:50:16.480 psychologically to everybody agree and I
01:50:19.239 think that a lot of people rebelled
01:50:21.760 against it and we're probably in a
01:50:23.920 better position now in 2024 like chamath
01:50:26.400 would not have come out I love chamath
01:50:27.960 would not have come out for Donald Trump
01:50:29.360 in 2020 right right now he's hosting
01:50:32.239 fundraisers and giving hundreds of
01:50:33.719 thousands of dollars to to our campaign
01:50:35.679 so I I think the fact that you have so
01:50:37.320 many old school liberals and old school
01:50:40.239 leftists say we're done with this
01:50:42.320 [ __ ] is actually a pretty good sign
01:50:44.079 yeah there's still social consequences
01:50:45.599 to it but not nearly as high as they
01:50:47.159 were four years ago well I think when
01:50:49.440 Elon purchased Twitter it changed the
01:50:52.360 entire ire game cuz now you have this
01:50:55.400 wild west uncensored version of social
01:50:58.520 media that's run by this Super Genius
01:51:01.000 mad man who has all the money in the
01:51:02.880 world right it's a crazy I mean it's
01:51:05.400 really without him we're in a lot of
01:51:07.760 trouble because let's say Twitter never
01:51:10.280 gets purchased they run the same way
01:51:13.320 they've run it in the past where they're
01:51:15.440 being influenced by whatever companies
01:51:18.880 and whatever agencies decide to remove
01:51:22.040 posts move people and ban Donald Trump
01:51:25.400 and ban a bunch of different
01:51:26.639 conservatives and ban a bunch of people
01:51:28.960 that were outcasts and just they just
01:51:31.199 decided they were controlling the
01:51:32.760 discourse well then you have no Outlets
01:51:35.280 other than parlor and we discussed this
01:51:38.119 yesterday those Outlets 100% got
01:51:41.599 Infested by Bots where absolutely where
01:51:44.920 they're putting Nazi stuff up and like
01:51:47.000 oh this is a Nazi site like no you're
01:51:49.280 the na you put it up there you poisoned
01:51:52.159 it instead of it being just a place
01:51:53.920 where conservatives can go and talk
01:51:55.400 about things and not be censored like
01:51:56.800 they were on Twitter then they get
01:51:58.719 infiltrated with all this hate [ __ ] and
01:52:00.920 then it becomes a hateful place and they
01:52:02.480 don't even want to go so now they're
01:52:03.639 homeless that's right well now all of a
01:52:05.400 sudden Twitter comes along Elon comes
01:52:07.520 along has this complete shift in how
01:52:09.840 he's viewing this attack on Free Speech
01:52:12.520 then you have shellenberger and Matt
01:52:14.199 taibe they go into the Twitter files
01:52:16.239 they find like oh my God like this is
01:52:18.880 this is unconstitutional this industrial
01:52:21.040 scale censorship is what it was
01:52:23.760 and they weren't right they they did all
01:52:27.360 this stuff and it turned out that all
01:52:29.480 the things they were saying were either
01:52:31.400 lies or were Incorrect corre and there's
01:52:34.040 no repercussions and so you're seeing
01:52:36.440 all this in real time and no one on the
01:52:38.599 left has any problem with it which to me
01:52:41.520 is insanity and the people that do have
01:52:43.400 a problem with it their solution seems
01:52:45.159 to be to just go to the right they don't
01:52:46.719 even feel like you can reform the left
01:52:48.880 they just people are just like tulsy
01:52:50.440 gabard becomes a republican people just
01:52:52.560 abandoning this like I can't talk to you
01:52:54.880 people that's right I'm doing an event
01:52:56.040 with Tulsa gabber tonight in
01:52:57.360 Pennsylvania I love her she's awesome
01:52:59.679 and uh yeah I think she basically
01:53:01.440 decided that the left cannot be reformed
01:53:03.320 in this country anymore that's what
01:53:04.239 happened with Bobby Kennedy that's
01:53:05.679 what's happened with a lot of old old
01:53:07.760 school liberals is they say yeah you
01:53:09.760 know we don't care what you do in your
01:53:11.239 bedroom but we we believe in the
01:53:13.480 fundamental right of people to speak
01:53:15.440 their mind and the Democrats just don't
01:53:17.440 believe in that anymore and I thought a
01:53:19.800 lot about like what's you know what what
01:53:21.480 is going on there and what's driving it
01:53:24.679 psychologically and I I think that I
01:53:27.679 think what's going on is the entire
01:53:30.480 modern democratic party grew up in an
01:53:32.760 era where there was consensus right
01:53:35.719 Walter kronite could say something about
01:53:38.480 the Vietnam War and it turned out he's
01:53:40.599 probably right about that actually and
01:53:42.520 it collapsed public support for the
01:53:44.679 Vietnam War where they grew up in in in
01:53:47.079 America where social social trust was
01:53:48.639 just so much higher and I think that a
01:53:50.760 lot of them are trying to
01:53:53.119 reimpose that social Trust on from the
01:53:56.000 top not recognizing that that high level
01:53:58.599 of social trust came organically from
01:54:01.239 the way that American society worked and
01:54:02.719 if you have people trying to reimpose it
01:54:05.560 from the top it actually degrades the
01:54:07.360 very thing that you're trying to create
01:54:08.920 because I've seen I mean family members
01:54:10.440 of mine who got really radicalized
01:54:12.599 because they were like wait a second
01:54:13.840 should we be masking three-year-olds in
01:54:15.960 our schools like does that do something
01:54:17.440 to their language development and then
01:54:19.040 they would get kicked off of Facebook
01:54:20.800 because a person with 900 Facebook
01:54:22.960 friends who has no public profile dared
01:54:25.719 to like question the prevailing
01:54:27.520 narrative and again they ended up being
01:54:29.520 right about it I actually think that
01:54:31.400 what the left is doing is degrading
01:54:34.440 social trust by trying to create it from
01:54:37.000 on high and I kind of get the
01:54:38.679 psychological impulse because you know
01:54:40.560 like a lot of great things that we do
01:54:43.079 come from high levels of social trust
01:54:45.440 but you've got to reestablish it
01:54:46.800 organically you can't try to force it on
01:54:48.480 people and there's been some course
01:54:50.239 correcting like did you read uh bezos's
01:54:52.520 article was it yesterday that came out
01:54:54.199 the Washington Post I did see that what
01:54:55.760 did you think of that I mean I I go back
01:54:57.800 and forth like again I I don't know Jeff
01:54:59.719 super well I've always liked him in my
01:55:01.840 interactions with him but the problem
01:55:03.679 with the Washington Post is not that
01:55:05.000 their editorial page has been
01:55:07.199 insufficiently conservative it's that
01:55:09.800 their entire journalism department is
01:55:12.639 fundamentally engaged in Democratic
01:55:15.239 political activism I mean the the two we
01:55:17.719 talk about this a lot and you know my
01:55:19.000 political guys are you know a lot of
01:55:20.560 them are outside and certainly a lot of
01:55:22.040 them will watch but we talk a lot about
01:55:23.920 which of the newspapers that have really
01:55:25.440 gone crazy and the New York Times is
01:55:27.560 kind of an exception yeah it's very
01:55:29.119 left-wing but it hasn't totally gone
01:55:30.960 insane The Washington Post might as well
01:55:34.199 be a propaganda Outlet of the democratic
01:55:36.320 party if you look from the hunter Biden
01:55:38.920 laptop to any number of stories where
01:55:41.560 they just tow the left-wing line almost
01:55:45.400 instinctively the problem was with the
01:55:47.719 journalism at the Washington Post it's
01:55:49.840 not with the editorials I don't care
01:55:51.800 frankly whether the editorial page
01:55:54.079 endorses Donald Trump or kamla Harris I
01:55:56.960 care about whether the the journalists
01:55:58.920 are lying about Donald Trump or lying
01:56:01.119 about kamla Harris and frankly they're
01:56:03.079 lying a lot in the negative Direction
01:56:04.719 about my running mate and they're lying
01:56:06.440 a lot in the positive direction about
01:56:07.719 kamla Harris so what I would like to see
01:56:09.599 from Jeff Bezos is a commitment to The
01:56:12.239 Washington Post not just being a
01:56:13.639 Democrat Super PAC I don't give a [ __ ]
01:56:15.400 if he hires a few more conservative
01:56:16.719 columnists it doesn't matter what
01:56:18.560 matters is do they hold their journalism
01:56:21.719 to anything like a high standard and if
01:56:24.239 they don't do that then to me it's just
01:56:26.320 wind addressing but it seems like that's
01:56:28.639 a at least a step in the right direction
01:56:31.360 one thing would be great you have an
01:56:33.320 argument against Donald Trump on the
01:56:35.560 front page next to an argument for
01:56:37.840 Donald Trump and let two different
01:56:40.280 intelligent people State their cases one
01:56:42.880 from a conservative perspective one from
01:56:44.639 a liberal perspective and let's see what
01:56:47.639 what resonates with you it's a step in
01:56:49.599 the right direction I I just think that
01:56:51.079 unless you change the underl l in you
01:56:53.199 know journalism to make it more fair
01:56:55.760 it's it's going to be only a step in the
01:56:57.560 right direction rather than fixing the
01:56:58.800 problem what else can he do I mean he's
01:57:01.000 probably pretty busy on his yacht
01:57:02.639 hanging out with his girlfriend with
01:57:03.800 tight shirts
01:57:05.040 on how does he have the time you know I
01:57:07.800 mean he can't go into the office and
01:57:09.719 like read everybody's work okay so let
01:57:11.840 let me give you an example there is a
01:57:13.320 there's a journalist by the name of Matt
01:57:15.000 Bole who writes it Breitbart do you know
01:57:16.880 Matt Bole you ever heard of Matt okay so
01:57:19.239 Matt is even though he writes for
01:57:21.320 Breitbart and I know that most people
01:57:23.040 assume that Breitbart is just this like
01:57:24.639 right-wing rag um Matt is he has one of
01:57:28.760 the best contacts of journalists in in
01:57:32.280 Washington like he knows what's going to
01:57:34.119 happen in the country before most
01:57:36.400 left-wing journalists because he talks
01:57:37.880 to the Liberals he talks to the
01:57:39.079 conservatives he has allies on Capitol
01:57:41.199 Hill I'd love to see The Washington Post
01:57:43.599 hire a guy like Matt Bole and say Matt
01:57:45.920 go and do what you're going to do and
01:57:48.119 obviously it's not going to be able to
01:57:49.679 have the a political bias to it but go
01:57:52.199 investigate if you want to go
01:57:52.960 investigate K Harris's campaign go and
01:57:54.880 do it but that is what it would look
01:57:56.960 like is empowering conservative and
01:57:59.599 independent journalism in the same way
01:58:01.320 that Jeff Bezos has empowered left-wing
01:58:03.000 journalism if I see that happening then
01:58:05.159 I'll be a little bit more optimistic
01:58:06.440 about about his stewardship well could
01:58:08.920 you imagine if there's the same sort of
01:58:10.480 scrutiny on kamala's speeches and
01:58:14.599 appearances in these media Outlets as
01:58:17.000 there is on trumps oh my God like one of
01:58:19.119 the things that we talked about was how
01:58:20.480 they edited that one uh answer that she
01:58:24.760 she was asked like what you know about
01:58:27.239 foreign policy yeah they edited it
01:58:29.920 completely and I I wasn't aware that
01:58:32.000 they put an answer for a completely
01:58:33.880 different question there well okay so I
01:58:37.679 I I think that what happened there
01:58:39.679 having done some try to understand that
01:58:41.840 a little bit better is they basically
01:58:43.480 just edited her answer down a lot so
01:58:47.280 that she didn't sound like a total
01:58:48.639 insane person because what aired I think
01:58:51.360 on the small
01:58:53.280 you know the what air on the channels
01:58:56.000 online that had a smaller pickup was the
01:58:58.400 rambling was the rambling the word Sal
01:59:00.400 but what actually aired on the news
01:59:02.199 programs was I mean it still didn't
01:59:04.520 sound very good but it sounded hell of a
01:59:06.079 lot better but let me let me give you a
01:59:07.360 very good example it's really not the
01:59:09.599 answer it's like they changed the answer
01:59:12.920 but let me see let me see what yeah no
01:59:16.239 you're right they changed the answer but
01:59:17.920 I just wanted to find the statistic from
01:59:19.280 from my team because I asked them this
01:59:20.599 last night so they did change the answer
01:59:23.239 and they changed in a way to protect her
01:59:25.119 and then importantly they refused to to
01:59:26.760 to release the transcript right so my
01:59:28.800 attitude would be just release the
01:59:30.079 transcript let people see what she
01:59:31.679 actually said so that you at least have
01:59:33.719 some Integrity as a journalistic outlet
01:59:35.360 but okay so here here's you of course
01:59:37.719 I'm sure paid attention to the cruffle
01:59:40.920 over a comedian at the Trump rity MSG I
01:59:45.040 think you even know this guy right he's
01:59:46.400 a good friend of mine so so he tells he
01:59:48.800 tells a joke about um you know Puerto
01:59:52.400 Rico the number of mentions on CNN about
01:59:55.960 this joke in the last 48 hours this was
01:59:58.679 as of last night 143 on MSNBC 101 on ABC
02:00:03.599 53 on NBC 32 and on CBS 31 in two days
02:00:09.079 they talked about that joke effectively
02:00:11.000 non-stop you know what it means to have
02:00:12.599 31 mentions on NBC news about this
02:00:16.560 particular thing that is a crazy that is
02:00:19.280 saturation last night Joe Biden called
02:00:23.280 the half of America that's going to vote
02:00:25.440 for Donald Trump garbage do you think
02:00:28.040 that the word garbage is going to appear
02:00:29.679 on CNN 141 times over the next two days
02:00:33.040 I would bet no now what's the difference
02:00:35.280 well one difference is that it was a
02:00:36.599 comedian telling a joke and it's the
02:00:38.599 president of the United States telling
02:00:40.639 what he actually thinks another
02:00:42.639 difference is again it's a comedian with
02:00:45.000 at best a tenous connection to the Trump
02:00:47.679 campaign and on the other hand you have
02:00:50.599 the actual C
02:00:52.520 president at a vice presidential
02:00:54.840 campaign event telling the vice
02:00:57.639 president or sorry telling the entire
02:01:00.320 country at an event sanctioned by the
02:01:02.639 kamla Harris campaign that half of
02:01:04.920 Americans are garbage and I guarantee
02:01:07.040 the media is not going to cover this in
02:01:08.320 the same way I mean here let me I don't
02:01:10.520 know if Jamie can bring this up but I
02:01:11.800 tweeted about this last night that
02:01:14.159 Politico when they initially tried to
02:01:16.239 write the story about what had been said
02:01:20.599 by Joe Biden they said that Biden had
02:01:23.560 called racism against Puerto Ricans
02:01:26.159 garbage well who disagrees with that I
02:01:28.760 think that racism against Puerto Ricans
02:01:30.360 is garbage but that's not what he said
02:01:33.480 he said that Trump's supporters are
02:01:35.800 garbage he said it's on video so
02:01:38.119 Politico tried to like rcon this it
02:01:40.960 turned out there was a video so we can
02:01:42.920 actually see for ourselves what was
02:01:44.320 actually said but the amount of
02:01:45.920 dishonesty in the American Media really
02:01:47.400 is off the charts it is but also with
02:01:50.400 Joe Biden I think at this point time
02:01:52.400 he's literally that crazy guy on the
02:01:54.320 porch yelling at the neighbors I mean
02:01:57.639 he's no one thinks he's there which is
02:02:00.800 also one of the fascinating things when
02:02:02.280 they asked her when did you know that he
02:02:05.719 was mentally impaired and why didn't you
02:02:08.599 talk about it earlier and there's this
02:02:11.159 Joe Biden has always done the amazing
02:02:16.360 work that Joe Biden does it's just like
02:02:20.360 this l where are you going you want to
02:02:23.480 get the like the lights that they use
02:02:25.119 air traffic controller like come this
02:02:27.159 way come this way help her out do you
02:02:30.239 think she wears a earpiece oh I wouldn't
02:02:32.360 be surprised I had IDE the earpiece one
02:02:34.239 was amazing little Bluetooth thing the
02:02:36.520 ear earring astonishing she talks the
02:02:39.360 only way I can describe it is she talks
02:02:40.719 in circles right it's it's like Tim
02:02:42.639 Dylan says it's like she does gypsy
02:02:44.119 curses because she speaks in Gypsy
02:02:47.000 curses that's very good oh but it's you
02:02:50.520 know we we need to build an opportunity
02:02:52.599 economy because if Americans don't have
02:02:54.639 opportunity then they're not going to
02:02:56.199 have the opportunity to be Americans and
02:02:58.159 it's like what the hell the opportunity
02:02:59.960 to generate wealth and generational
02:03:02.639 wealth like wait a minute do you know
02:03:04.880 how few people generate generational
02:03:06.760 wealth that means you have so much money
02:03:08.119 you're going to give it to other
02:03:09.239 Generations but there's there's actually
02:03:11.560 okay I mean I give a lot of speeches so
02:03:13.320 there's actually a skill to this I think
02:03:16.199 that she is the Michael Jordan of using
02:03:19.960 as many words as possible to say as
02:03:21.840 little as possible there's actually a
02:03:23.800 certain gift that she has because you
02:03:26.280 listen to her talk and you you know
02:03:28.840 you're 1002 words into it you're 500
02:03:31.320 words into it and you're like what the
02:03:33.760 hell did she just say she didn't say
02:03:35.639 anything right and that actually I mean
02:03:37.800 okay so yeah there's there's a certain
02:03:39.480 political skill in saying a lot without
02:03:41.119 actually saying anything but it actually
02:03:44.040 worries me about her being president
02:03:46.679 like okay they're all these substantive
02:03:48.320 policy disagreements and we could talk
02:03:49.840 about okay I don't like her border
02:03:51.159 policies I don't like this I don't like
02:03:52.480 that but what does she do when she's in
02:03:56.000 a meeting with a world leader and she
02:03:58.280 has to like know the details of public
02:04:01.199 policy to negotiate with Vladimir Putin
02:04:03.880 or Xi Jinping like one of the major
02:04:05.440 things that you do as a president is you
02:04:08.239 participate in economic negotiations
02:04:10.760 like what tariffs are we going to apply
02:04:12.520 on your goods unless you lower the
02:04:14.119 tariffs on ours or vice versa right you
02:04:16.440 have to be able to know a little bit
02:04:18.119 about your job to be the president of
02:04:19.920 the United States and I don't know that
02:04:22.119 she has an ounce of curiosity about
02:04:24.119 public policy in this country that's
02:04:25.480 what scares the hell out of me well it's
02:04:27.440 just strange that everyone's accepting
02:04:30.480 that this person who is the least
02:04:31.960 popular vice president
02:04:33.760 ever is now the solution to the problem
02:04:37.199 and that the media machine in just a few
02:04:39.880 days did this 180 and just sold her as
02:04:44.040 the solution and as long as they keep
02:04:46.719 her from having these conversations
02:04:48.880 where she's allowed to talk that's right
02:04:50.719 they're able to pull this off and the
02:04:52.840 the fact that it's happening with no
02:04:54.239 primary should be really concerning to
02:04:56.480 people cuz that's never happened before
02:04:58.840 they could have had a primary well it's
02:05:00.280 also part of the process where you
02:05:02.320 identify people's flaws you figure out
02:05:04.760 what they're good at what they're bad at
02:05:06.159 like the primary is actually a grueling
02:05:07.800 process how you handle pressure how you
02:05:09.520 handle pressure right and we don't
02:05:10.800 really know how she's handled pressure
02:05:12.239 because she's only done it for a little
02:05:13.440 while and if if you just look at Donald
02:05:15.920 Trump's public schedule JD Vance's
02:05:18.079 public schedule versus KLA Harris dude
02:05:19.880 it is striking how little she does there
02:05:22.920 was an interview that she did I think
02:05:24.320 it's the only really tough interview
02:05:25.559 she's done with Brett Bayer of Fox News
02:05:28.159 I believe that she had a clear calendar
02:05:31.520 for two days before she did this
02:05:33.760 interview and so they just prepping her
02:05:36.079 just just prepping her but you know how
02:05:38.280 how can you actually you know that's not
02:05:40.719 pressure if you get to take two days off
02:05:42.520 for one single interview that that's not
02:05:45.280 pressure and also just little things I
02:05:47.040 mean look there's this story out there
02:05:49.079 to be clear I have no idea if it's true
02:05:51.840 but there's a woman who has gone on the
02:05:54.119 record and said that Doug mhof KLA
02:05:56.559 Harris's husband smacked her in the face
02:05:58.599 in France okay that's been reported on
02:06:00.440 the media I'm sure you guys can find it
02:06:01.840 if you want to okay again maybe it's not
02:06:05.119 true maybe it is true but these things
02:06:07.719 take time to actually figure out and
02:06:09.599 investigate and here here's the thing
02:06:11.639 you know you know this I know this most
02:06:13.239 people know this if you are a domestic
02:06:15.440 abuser that usually doesn't stop with
02:06:17.760 one person like most domestic abusers
02:06:20.040 are serial domestic abusers is it in the
02:06:22.719 public interest to do some investigation
02:06:25.559 about whether the White House the
02:06:28.280 president could be sharing the White
02:06:30.239 House with the person who is engaged in
02:06:32.760 domestic abuse that is in the public
02:06:35.159 interest to know not only is the
02:06:37.360 American Media not that interested in it
02:06:38.880 but most importantly you don't have the
02:06:40.480 time to really investigate some of these
02:06:42.199 accusations meanwhile every time
02:06:44.440 somebody says anything about Donald
02:06:46.400 Trump without an ounce of evidence the
02:06:48.480 American Media picks it up and runs with
02:06:50.239 it and makes an entire news cycle
02:06:52.079 totally incurious about what's going on
02:06:53.559 with KLA Harris but I think over time
02:06:56.239 what's interesting is most people are
02:06:58.239 becoming aware of this extreme bias the
02:07:01.000 difference in the scrutiny that's
02:07:02.480 applied to Trump so that that's right
02:07:04.520 but you you go back into this question
02:07:05.639 you asked me about Jeff Bezos this is
02:07:07.719 why you need good reporters who have the
02:07:11.679 investigatory skills who are empowered
02:07:14.040 by their employers to go out and do the
02:07:15.559 investigations like you know your
02:07:17.239 platform you're having more honest and
02:07:19.559 open conversations than anything that's
02:07:21.199 happening in the corporate media it's
02:07:22.679 like one of the reasons why I listen to
02:07:23.840 your show one of the reasons why I'm
02:07:25.119 happy to be here but you don't have like
02:07:27.559 a person working for you who's going to
02:07:29.800 go to like France and talk to this woman
02:07:32.639 and investigate whether this is true
02:07:34.920 this is why you know I've told Elon this
02:07:37.199 but like the most useful piece of
02:07:39.520 philanthropy if you're a right of Center
02:07:41.599 American would be to set up a nonprofit
02:07:43.880 organization where you pay a really good
02:07:46.639 reporter for five years you give them
02:07:49.280 complete job security and you just tell
02:07:51.079 them go off and investigate what's going
02:07:53.440 on in the world and and bring it back
02:07:56.000 and and report on the truth because if
02:07:58.040 you don't have that then that is where
02:08:00.000 the media still has a fundamental
02:08:01.360 advantage over us is they've got an army
02:08:04.239 of people investigating me and Donald
02:08:06.400 Trump there's no one really
02:08:07.880 investigating Kell Harris well there's
02:08:10.480 also the amount of left-wing media
02:08:13.199 versus right-wing media is pretty
02:08:14.960 disturbing yeah like what what what is
02:08:17.480 the percentage of networks that lean
02:08:19.760 left C CNN clearly MSNBC ABC NBC
02:08:26.199 CBS and then you have Fox then you have
02:08:28.520 Fox and then you have a couple of online
02:08:30.199 things like news nation and what have
02:08:31.960 you but and if you just reach is much
02:08:33.800 less reach is much much less and if you
02:08:35.559 just look at I mean you're only you know
02:08:37.920 you and a few others are the only people
02:08:39.280 who can compare with the actual platform
02:08:41.199 size of an NBC a CBS I mean yeah fewer
02:08:44.520 people watch them now than they did 20
02:08:46.280 years ago but if you look man like
02:08:48.599 you're still getting 5 to 8 million
02:08:50.880 viewers every single night for each of
02:08:53.079 the major networks on the Nightly News
02:08:55.239 that's incredible reach right there's
02:08:57.320 still a lot of power there and you know
02:08:59.960 to your to your point about like the
02:09:03.079 comparison you know Fox News number one
02:09:05.840 if you look at Fox news's viewership
02:09:07.280 compared to NBC is there just dwarfs NBC
02:09:09.400 dwarfs it but more importantly in some
02:09:11.960 ways is Fox News which I do think is
02:09:14.800 very important but yeah they they have a
02:09:17.239 right of siner bias certainly I will
02:09:19.239 admit that but if you look at how much
02:09:22.239 Fox News is covering the left fairly
02:09:24.480 versus the right it's much more balanced
02:09:27.119 than like an NBC right like NBC would
02:09:30.159 never have an interview with Donald J
02:09:33.000 Trump where the journalist is asking
02:09:34.920 tough questions but is like sitting down
02:09:36.920 and broadcasting Donald Trump for an
02:09:38.400 hour Fox News would do that for kamla
02:09:40.559 Harris and they did do that for kamla
02:09:42.360 Harris and there's a real difference
02:09:44.159 there well there's also like the way
02:09:47.440 Brett Brer uh interviewed bear how bear
02:09:52.119 the way he interviewed K Harris is very
02:09:55.320 similar to the way he interviewed Donald
02:09:56.760 Trump exactly he's exactly and nobody
02:09:59.920 accused him of doing anything sneaky
02:10:02.480 then no or no one was even angry at him
02:10:04.480 then well because the expectation is
02:10:05.800 that you're going to interrupt and
02:10:06.760 you're going to fact check and you're
02:10:07.880 going to try to actually do the job of
02:10:09.599 an interviewer but the expectation is
02:10:11.559 that if you touch kamla with anything
02:10:13.239 other than kid gloves you know you're
02:10:15.719 not allowed to do
02:10:16.960 that but I think again I think most
02:10:19.520 people are upset it's one of the reasons
02:10:21.679 why the movement is so the movement
02:10:25.159 towards Trump they're so enthusiastic
02:10:28.040 they're so energetic because they do
02:10:30.639 realize that there's this imbalance and
02:10:33.440 they don't like it and they they think
02:10:35.679 that the only way this is going to get
02:10:37.520 fixed is someone who's a complete
02:10:39.360 Outsider and you can't be more Outsider
02:10:41.599 than a guy who they're literally turning
02:10:43.239 the judicial system against him they're
02:10:45.400 literally trying to prosecute him like a
02:10:46.960 Banana Republic and they're doing it
02:10:48.320 over and over and over again and they're
02:10:49.599 doing it they're speaking about it
02:10:51.360 openly we're going to put him in jail
02:10:53.079 we're going to lock him up and that way
02:10:54.280 we're going to keep keep him from being
02:10:55.880 in the office well you know I I use this
02:10:58.760 this analogy a couple times publicly but
02:11:01.119 so what's interesting to me about
02:11:03.559 Toddlers and you know I've talked with
02:11:06.199 Tucker Carlson about this toddlers lie
02:11:09.920 in a way that's very different from how
02:11:12.000 everybody else lies right so like if
02:11:14.040 you're telling a lie normally you know
02:11:16.880 hey hey did you do that thing you would
02:11:19.119 say no no no some you know some somebody
02:11:21.000 else did it or they kind of qualified a
02:11:23.719 little bit let me give an example my
02:11:24.880 4-year-old I'm a big Baker probably
02:11:27.159 surprised by that but I'm a big Baker
02:11:29.280 and uh my four-year-old and I are making
02:11:30.679 an Oreo cake a few weeks ago and I um my
02:11:35.639 four-year-old is helping me he likes he
02:11:37.400 likes to help me out a lot when I bake
02:11:39.639 and I go to the bathroom and the Oreos
02:11:41.719 that we're supposed to put in the Oreo
02:11:43.159 cake like crumble them up and put them
02:11:44.480 in the cake like half of them are gone
02:11:46.040 when I get back and I'm like buddy what
02:11:48.400 happened to the Oreos and he looks at me
02:11:50.440 and without a hint of irony or shame he
02:11:52.559 says I didn't eat the Oreos you
02:11:56.159 did right so that's the way that comma
02:11:59.480 Harris lies is I didn't need the Oreos
02:12:01.679 you did not only does she actively brag
02:12:04.639 and has her Administration actively
02:12:06.119 bragged about trying to arrest her
02:12:07.559 political opponents she will go out and
02:12:09.599 say that if Donald Trump is the
02:12:10.800 president he's going to arrest his
02:12:12.079 political opponents even though he
02:12:13.480 already was president and he didn't do
02:12:14.920 that did you see she went on Shannon
02:12:16.400 sharp and said that he's going to take
02:12:17.960 away your second amendment rights it's
02:12:19.960 crazy the person who wants to who
02:12:22.199 literally wants to confiscate Firearms
02:12:24.840 KLA Harris is saying that Donald Trump
02:12:26.679 wants to take away your second amendment
02:12:27.920 rights dude the the thing that okay do
02:12:30.960 you know who Steve Bannon is yes okay
02:12:32.960 fascinating guy didn't he just get out
02:12:35.480 he got out of prison yesterday they have
02:12:38.079 the audacity to say Donald Trump wants
02:12:40.480 to jail his political opponents Steve
02:12:43.280 Bannon just got out of prison after a
02:12:45.360 four-year prison sentence yesterday and
02:12:47.760 by the way do you know what he was put
02:12:48.960 in jail for do you know the actual
02:12:50.480 charge no contempt of congress Eric
02:12:53.760 Holder who was Obama's attorney general
02:12:57.000 was found in contempt of congress or at
02:12:59.639 least was you know he he there there was
02:13:02.119 Congress found him in contempt it was
02:13:04.360 never litigated he was never tried to
02:13:06.400 put in jail there was no court case
02:13:08.520 around it the contempt of congress that
02:13:10.760 Steve Bannon engaged in is that the j6
02:13:13.559 committee or one of these you know
02:13:14.840 Banana Republic committees from the
02:13:16.440 Congressional Democrats they issued him
02:13:18.280 a subpoena he under the advice of his
02:13:20.760 lawyer felt that he couldn't actually
02:13:23.400 respond to the subpoena because
02:13:25.079 executive privilege applied they held
02:13:27.520 him in contempt of congress and they
02:13:29.280 threw him in prison for it a charge that
02:13:31.760 has been levied against multiple
02:13:33.520 Democrats Republicans never tried to
02:13:35.280 throw anybody in prison against it over
02:13:37.239 it Steve Bannon just got out of prison
02:13:39.320 KL Harris is literally using the power
02:13:42.040 of government has already used the power
02:13:44.000 of government to jail her political
02:13:45.840 opponents and she's saying that Donald
02:13:47.400 Trump is going to do the thing that he
02:13:49.000 didn't do and she did when they were in
02:13:51.559 respective positions of power do you
02:13:52.960 think it's because they're worried that
02:13:54.760 if he gets into power and he gets back
02:13:56.840 into the office that he's going to start
02:13:58.800 investigating a lot of this stuff and
02:14:01.320 the the 51 Former Intelligence agents
02:14:03.599 that's exactly what they're afraid of
02:14:04.960 they're they're afraid of consequences
02:14:06.360 they're afraid of and look do I think
02:14:08.040 the 51 intelligence agents who signed
02:14:09.880 that letter should go to prison no but
02:14:11.840 should they they be stripped of their
02:14:13.000 security clearance absolutely I do right
02:14:15.760 they lied they used their position of
02:14:17.599 authority and lied to the American
02:14:19.520 people about something that was in the
02:14:20.800 National interest if there are no
02:14:22.079 consequences for that then what are we
02:14:23.880 doing and they're probably very
02:14:25.400 concerned with a trial that's going to
02:14:27.159 reveal what the elements of that
02:14:29.679 particular story really were like oh
02:14:31.800 there there's yeah there's a lot of
02:14:33.239 corruption there there are I'm sure
02:14:34.800 higher ups there are people who said one
02:14:36.920 thing in public but said something else
02:14:38.559 in private there there probably is at
02:14:41.199 some level of that whole thing people
02:14:43.440 who maybe perjured themselves or at
02:14:45.800 least unethically lied um look there's a
02:14:49.719 lot going on there but but you know
02:14:52.199 Donald Trump is not going out there and
02:14:53.920 has never said I want to arrest you
02:14:55.440 because you're a Democrat he's never
02:14:57.000 said I want to arrest you because you
02:14:58.360 disagree with me he's never said I want
02:14:59.639 to censor you even because you engage in
02:15:02.040 disinformation what he has said is that
02:15:04.239 we should investigate some of the
02:15:05.679 obvious sources of corruption in the
02:15:07.760 United States government that's not
02:15:09.440 going after your political opponents
02:15:11.440 that's what KL Harris said actually well
02:15:12.880 one of the things that he's talked about
02:15:13.960 pretty openly is that he could have gone
02:15:15.360 after Hillary Clinton and he didn't
02:15:16.800 because he thought it would look bad for
02:15:17.920 the country and it's true I mean he
02:15:19.760 really could have she did Comm crimes
02:15:22.119 the FBI a Democrat who's supporting Kam
02:15:25.079 Hera said that she committed I think not
02:15:27.440 just crimes but maybe felonies she
02:15:29.800 committed felonies and what Donald Trump
02:15:31.520 did is said you know what it's bad for
02:15:33.280 the country a lot of my voters would
02:15:34.960 love me to prosecute Hillary Clinton but
02:15:36.880 it's bad for the country so I'm not
02:15:38.320 going to do it that is the exact
02:15:40.239 opposite of course of what kamla Harris
02:15:41.880 and Joe Biden have done and again the
02:15:44.440 media it's a total upside down Universe
02:15:47.360 where they accuse us of doing the very
02:15:49.760 thing that they've done themselves
02:15:51.800 yeah it's really wild to watch it's the
02:15:54.119 gaslighting is off the charts so there's
02:15:56.559 there's a bunch of things that people
02:15:58.000 are uh deeply concerned with in this
02:16:00.079 country uh and it seems like for men
02:16:03.159 it's the economy that seems like the
02:16:05.440 primary thing that people are concerned
02:16:06.800 with and it seems like for a lot of
02:16:08.679 women it's abortion sure abortion and
02:16:11.760 roie Wade is a big concern yeah now I if
02:16:16.360 I'm correct your position and this is
02:16:19.239 what they wanted when they overturned
02:16:21.639 roie Wade they wanted to leave it in
02:16:23.880 control of the states is this your
02:16:25.960 position yeah so what president Trump
02:16:27.800 has said and what I said is abortion is
02:16:31.360 now a matter for state legislators State
02:16:34.959 voters to determine and there's there's
02:16:37.760 I mean one that's always what the
02:16:39.799 argument was right if Row versus Wade
02:16:41.679 goes away then the state legislator the
02:16:44.478 state populations are going to make each
02:16:46.160 individual abortion decision the same
02:16:47.679 way that like you know California has
02:16:49.318 different laws on a whole host of
02:16:51.558 subjects that Alabama does the idea is
02:16:54.120 that yeah California would make its own
02:16:55.599 abortion policy Alabama would make its
02:16:57.318 own abortion policy and I so there's
02:16:59.718 there's a basic sort of principle of
02:17:01.280 federalism at work there but I also
02:17:03.200 think that you know knowing Donald Trump
02:17:04.718 well I think he's motivated also by
02:17:07.040 desire for us to just stop having a
02:17:10.519 culture War over this particular issue
02:17:13.519 and to let the voters in these states
02:17:15.679 make these decisions while the national
02:17:17.359 government focuses on things like
02:17:19.439 lowering the cost of groceries and
02:17:21.120 lowering the cost of housing and
02:17:22.439 securing the southern border and I think
02:17:24.398 there's actually some great wisdom in
02:17:26.240 that because you know think about this
02:17:28.679 abortion has not really been a political
02:17:30.160 issue for 50 years now we say that it is
02:17:32.280 and obviously we disagreed about it and
02:17:33.879 people thought about it it was always
02:17:35.478 something that the Supreme Court said
02:17:37.318 this is the way it is there's no
02:17:39.160 political decision-making every European
02:17:41.799 nation has made abortion policy
02:17:44.318 democratically and that's what Donald
02:17:46.000 Trump is saying do what every European
02:17:47.959 nation has done let the voters decide
02:17:50.679 what what their abortion policy is going
02:17:52.120 to be and we're going to focus the
02:17:54.160 national government on on different
02:17:55.679 things and I I say this as somebody who
02:17:57.679 you like I I I genuinely you know want
02:18:00.120 people to choose life and I'm you know a
02:18:02.280 big believer in families and I think you
02:18:05.359 know having children has been like a
02:18:07.040 revelatory experience for me and I want
02:18:08.920 our country to be more pro- family more
02:18:11.000 pro- child I think there are all these
02:18:12.920 things that we can do at the federal
02:18:14.120 level to make our country more Pro
02:18:15.799 family and more Pro child you know make
02:18:17.599 Child Care easier you know stop I've
02:18:19.799 actually sponsored legisl to stop the
02:18:22.000 surprise medical bills that happen when
02:18:24.040 people you I've seen this with my own
02:18:25.760 wife you go to the hospital you come
02:18:27.879 home you've got a beautiful baby but
02:18:29.200 You' also got a $20,000 unexpected bill
02:18:32.160 because you choose the wrong you know
02:18:34.840 the wrong outof Network healthc care
02:18:36.558 provider when you're at the moment of
02:18:38.280 delivering a baby like there are all
02:18:39.718 these things we can do to make it easier
02:18:42.558 for young women young families to choose
02:18:45.359 life but Donald Trump I think wants
02:18:47.799 abortion policy and he said this
02:18:49.599 explicitly to be decided at the state
02:18:52.080 level I'm not it it's not possible for
02:18:55.840 me to get pregnant so when I think about
02:18:58.439 these things according to some people
02:19:01.359 depends on who you ask but I I think
02:19:03.558 when when you talk you get with the 21st
02:19:05.040 century man it's possible for a man to
02:19:06.638 get pregnant now to Mo for most people I
02:19:09.799 think one of the issues is or for a lot
02:19:12.318 of people one of the issues is that men
02:19:14.478 are making decisions for what women can
02:19:16.799 can and can't doar and one of the more
02:19:20.000 concerning aspects of this is like say
02:19:22.120 if you live in a state like Texas where
02:19:24.840 there's a a limit to when you can get an
02:19:26.959 abortion I think it's like six weeks
02:19:28.398 which a lot of people think at that
02:19:30.120 point in time you can't even tell
02:19:31.318 whether or not you're pregnant and this
02:19:32.959 puts a lot of women in like very
02:19:34.439 vulnerable positions and then there's
02:19:38.080 this thought that they could go to
02:19:40.200 another state where it is legal and have
02:19:43.718 an abortion but they could be possibly
02:19:46.638 prosecuted for that in their
02:19:49.479 state that that's concerning to me that
02:19:52.520 we can make if there's a place in the
02:19:54.960 country where it's legal to have medical
02:19:56.640 procedure and you live in a state where
02:19:58.800 it's not legal that your state can
02:20:00.720 decide what you can and can't do with
02:20:02.120 your body which is essentially based on
02:20:04.520 a religious idea and a lot of the and
02:20:07.880 I'm not criticizing it one way or
02:20:09.080 another but I'm saying that a lot of
02:20:10.600 what this choose life thing is about
02:20:12.760 that life is precious and life is sacred
02:20:14.680 and life begins at the moment of
02:20:15.840 conception and some people agree with
02:20:18.359 this but other people disagree with this
02:20:20.359 and it's seems to be uh a lot of it is
02:20:22.920 based in religion my concern is using
02:20:27.200 that to dictate whether or not a person
02:20:30.040 can legally travel to another state
02:20:32.240 where I don't think the government
02:20:33.720 should be monitoring where you travel or
02:20:36.120 what you do when you travel as long as
02:20:38.000 that thing is legal and I'm concerned
02:20:41.359 with this idea that you could be
02:20:42.520 prosecuted for it in your state for
02:20:45.200 doing something that's legal somewhere
02:20:46.680 else I don't like the idea to be clear
02:20:49.200 I've not heard of this maybe as a as
02:20:52.680 like a possibility but not as something
02:20:54.399 that actually exists in the in the law
02:20:56.399 but I've not heard of somebody being
02:20:58.080 arrested and I don't like the idea of
02:20:59.760 arresting people for Country I've heard
02:21:02.359 of I've heard of the discussion I've
02:21:03.720 heard as a threat that like I don't like
02:21:05.640 the idea to be clear of people getting
02:21:07.520 arrested for freely moving around the
02:21:09.640 country right I think so so you're
02:21:11.600 pointing about it being a religious idea
02:21:13.359 I mean I would say I know a number of
02:21:15.040 non-religious people who are very
02:21:16.760 pro-life and I think the honest answer
02:21:19.520 is that what we're doing is we're trying
02:21:21.600 to figure out what is the right balance
02:21:23.479 between autonomy and life I I say this
02:21:25.960 to somebody who when Ohio made this
02:21:28.800 decision I campaigned very aggressively
02:21:31.479 for the more pro-life position in the
02:21:34.560 state of Ohio and my side lost in fact
02:21:36.399 we got our assets kicked we we lost 6040
02:21:39.280 and I I I took some I took some learning
02:21:41.760 from that I think the one of the things
02:21:43.080 that I took as a as a as a learning as a
02:21:46.000 guy who cares about this issue is
02:21:48.439 Republicans we've got to earn the
02:21:49.720 people's trust
02:21:51.319 because they don't trust the idea that
02:21:54.080 when we say that we're pro- family we
02:21:55.680 don't just mean Pro birth a lot of
02:21:58.080 people say you're Pro birth but you're
02:21:59.399 not actually pro- family and I think
02:22:01.160 there's a lot that we can do as you know
02:22:03.560 Republicans to try to earn back the
02:22:05.439 trust of the American people but if I'm
02:22:07.359 trying to represent as as fairly as I
02:22:09.080 can the pro-choice and the pro-life
02:22:11.200 position here's what I think is really
02:22:12.880 going on is you have something now some
02:22:17.160 people would say maybe religiously
02:22:18.760 motivated maybe not that it's a human
02:22:20.600 life I would say that it's a human life
02:22:22.479 but it at least has the potential to be
02:22:23.840 human life and then on the other hand
02:22:25.920 you have again I freely recognize this
02:22:28.200 you have a woman who wants to make a
02:22:29.680 choice about what she wants to do with
02:22:32.359 with her own body those are two very
02:22:34.960 profound values both of which I think
02:22:37.840 are value are valuable right I mean I
02:22:39.760 think autonomy is really important I
02:22:41.160 also think life is really important and
02:22:43.200 what we're trying to talk about
02:22:44.600 fundamentally I think again I'm trying
02:22:45.960 to be fair to both sides here is to
02:22:48.200 balance the interest in life against the
02:22:50.640 interest in autonomy and I think that
02:22:53.280 the way to do that at least my view is
02:22:55.920 to let the American people debate and
02:22:59.040 talk about and argue about this issue
02:23:01.920 and come to this decision on a
02:23:04.000 state-by-state basis and again
02:23:05.920 California Florida Ohio Alabama we're
02:23:09.000 going have different solutions to this
02:23:11.439 particular problem but that's what we're
02:23:13.120 trying to do right people like me are
02:23:15.080 trying to say look I think life really
02:23:17.240 matters and other people are trying to
02:23:18.920 say I think autonomy really matters the
02:23:20.680 truth is that 95% of Americans would
02:23:22.840 probably say there's some way to strike
02:23:25.680 the balance in the middle you know where
02:23:27.880 most of Europe has ended up here and
02:23:29.960 it's actually striking because you think
02:23:31.160 of Europe again as a more socially
02:23:32.680 liberal place in America almost every
02:23:34.479 place in Europe has ended up effectively
02:23:37.200 where late term abortion outside of
02:23:39.760 cases of medical necessity is banned
02:23:42.359 outright and then you know early stage
02:23:45.439 abortion is allowed that's how most
02:23:47.920 societies that democratically settle on
02:23:49.720 this that's how they strike the balance
02:23:51.880 I think my attitude is I'm running for
02:23:53.319 vice president I'm not trying to tell
02:23:54.600 you how to strike the right balance but
02:23:56.520 we want to preserve the right of states
02:23:58.160 to make these decisions I think what
02:23:59.880 people are afraid of is men telling
02:24:02.319 women what they can and can't do with
02:24:03.880 their bodies that's the autonomy value I
02:24:06.040 get it man I look I I get it and I think
02:24:08.560 that there there is a very real and
02:24:11.040 valid argument here that autonomy should
02:24:14.080 take precedence here but I also think if
02:24:16.080 we're being honest there is an argument
02:24:17.840 that life matters too and that's that's
02:24:21.439 the balance that people are trying to
02:24:22.680 it's very complex and people don't want
02:24:24.319 to look at it that way I I always
02:24:25.760 discuss when I I talk about abortion I
02:24:27.680 say it's one of these very human issues
02:24:30.800 where it's very strange where most
02:24:33.680 people think like at the moment of
02:24:36.040 conception if you could just remove
02:24:38.080 those cells and keep them from
02:24:39.520 multiplying that's less bad than if you
02:24:42.479 wait six months right like almost
02:24:44.000 everybody would agree to that so what
02:24:45.600 are we doing then like what like bill
02:24:47.680 has a great bit about it you seen b
02:24:50.840 F and there is a moral intuition there
02:24:52.920 that obviously like something that looks
02:24:54.319 and feels like a baby is more valuable
02:24:56.520 than you know something that's just
02:24:58.120 looks heart has a heartbeat sure but but
02:25:01.240 I you know I think the the it's just
02:25:03.439 hard right because it's not clear to me
02:25:05.399 philosophically where you draw the line
02:25:07.520 here um it's a very like hard question
02:25:10.439 to figure out and I think that's why
02:25:12.040 people debate it and disagree with about
02:25:14.120 it so vociferously but it's it's
02:25:16.200 interesting man the the thing that I
02:25:19.680 find again as a person who leans more in
02:25:22.160 the pro-life side of this debate is okay
02:25:25.600 so you will sometimes hear people on the
02:25:27.600 left say well late term abortion doesn't
02:25:29.359 happen well there's an organization
02:25:31.520 called the gut mocker Institute it's a
02:25:33.160 pro-choice organization it's a pro you
02:25:35.000 know abortion rights organization and
02:25:37.319 they found that there are approximately
02:25:40.000 I think it's 12,000 abortions that
02:25:42.120 happen in the second half of pregnancy
02:25:45.720 so this is past 20 weeks maybe it's even
02:25:47.800 past 22 weeks about 12,000 abortions
02:25:50.800 past 22 weeks okay they also found that
02:25:53.560 of those 8,000 of them are purely
02:25:56.080 elective there's no medical necessity
02:25:58.279 there's no like you know the baby has
02:25:59.920 some genetic abnormality it's just pure
02:26:02.640 elective late term abortion I don't know
02:26:05.960 how we can't get consensus that that is
02:26:07.720 not good right right come on and in fact
02:26:12.080 especially when it's not a medical
02:26:13.279 necessity exactly every European nation
02:26:15.760 has gotten to that point where you say
02:26:17.760 okay like 8,000 late term abortions like
02:26:20.800 come on but again it's not my decision
02:26:23.359 as the vice president or and and that's
02:26:25.200 not president Trump's view he's very
02:26:26.880 against a National Abortion ban because
02:26:29.560 he wants this debate to happen
02:26:31.880 organically and democratically and I
02:26:34.479 think that's that's kind of our our
02:26:35.760 attitude to this now you're you're right
02:26:37.240 again there is a balance to strike here
02:26:39.560 but usually in American society we
02:26:41.359 recognize that the way to strike that
02:26:43.000 balance is to debate it as Citizens and
02:26:47.720 not to have like lawyers and judges make
02:26:49.640 these determinations for us believe it
02:26:51.359 or not Joe Biden had one of the most
02:26:52.920 logical takes on it a long time ago a
02:26:55.080 long time ago back when he could talk
02:26:56.479 back when his brain wasn't fried and he
02:26:58.240 he said abortion should be safe legal
02:27:00.399 and rare well that was my grandmother's
02:27:02.600 view right that was my grandmother's
02:27:04.040 view that was the Bill Clinton view yeah
02:27:06.000 and I I do think that there's something
02:27:07.880 that is really weird about this whole
02:27:10.560 debate where you know thank God to be
02:27:13.080 clear this is not true of the gross
02:27:14.600 majority of our pro-choice citizens but
02:27:17.279 you do sometimes see people like they'll
02:27:19.120 go on Tik tock and they'll celebrate
02:27:21.520 having an abortion yeah like I've known
02:27:24.040 many many women usually when I was
02:27:27.319 younger um who chose to have abortions
02:27:29.920 because they felt like they didn't have
02:27:31.000 any other options and you know I don't I
02:27:33.359 don't judge them I think that a lot of
02:27:36.399 them just felt like they were completely
02:27:38.520 trapped and they made the decision that
02:27:40.640 was ultimately right for them again my
02:27:42.160 argument is we need to try to gain those
02:27:44.160 women's trust back because clearly the
02:27:46.040 Republican party on this issue has lost
02:27:48.240 a lot of trust but none of them were
02:27:50.560 like baking birthday cakes and posting
02:27:52.800 about it afterwards they recognized that
02:27:54.960 this is a medical procedure and this is
02:27:58.240 you know something that they felt they
02:28:00.359 had to do but celebrating something like
02:28:03.080 that is just bizarre to me and I I I'm
02:28:06.920 much more comfortable with the people
02:28:08.399 who say safe legal rare than I am with
02:28:10.760 the people who say let's Shadow abortion
02:28:12.479 from the rooftops well it's just this
02:28:14.160 Rebellion thing you know and it's also
02:28:16.000 Rebellion like the the concept in the
02:28:18.000 Zeitgeist is that abortion had always
02:28:20.720 been you know Ro roie Wade always been
02:28:23.279 the law of the land and then all of a
02:28:25.200 sudden that was taken away and you have
02:28:27.520 these religious men who are trying to
02:28:29.319 dictate what women can and can't do with
02:28:31.240 their bodies yeah yeah no look I mean
02:28:33.840 again I I understand that I understand
02:28:35.880 the the the push back against that but I
02:28:38.520 I think you can go like with so many
02:28:39.880 other issues you can go way too far
02:28:42.319 about it and it becomes trying to
02:28:44.520 celebrate something that at the very
02:28:46.600 best if you grant I think every argument
02:28:48.680 of the pro-choice side it is a neutral
02:28:50.960 thing not something to be celebrated I
02:28:52.520 think there's very few people that are
02:28:53.600 celebrating though just the
02:28:55.359 extreme The Tick to it's it's like
02:28:57.800 everything right where and I I and I try
02:28:59.920 you this is something that that is
02:29:01.120 dangerous about social media is the the
02:29:04.240 danger of social media with me is not to
02:29:06.680 me that I live in my own Echo chamber
02:29:08.680 and just have views reinforced the
02:29:11.240 danger is that I'm only exposed to the
02:29:13.720 crazy people on the other side who make
02:29:17.399 me make it easier for me to adopt my own
02:29:19.359 worldview because I'm saying oh it's
02:29:21.160 just people celebrating when in reality
02:29:23.520 you know like like you said most
02:29:24.800 American women even those who are
02:29:27.319 pro-choice are not celebrating this
02:29:29.920 thing I think that's one of the
02:29:31.359 Insidious things about the social media
02:29:33.200 algorithm is that it highlights things
02:29:35.880 that people engage with outrageous which
02:29:38.279 is more outrageous more things that they
02:29:41.560 find reprehensible they see more of it I
02:29:43.920 see so many guys with makeup telling me
02:29:47.120 they're going to take your kids
02:29:48.520 indoctrinate your kids like why I saying
02:29:50.399 that was because they're highlighting it
02:29:51.680 and when you have an app that's owned by
02:29:53.800 China that is the number one is that a
02:29:56.720 coincidence that's yeah facilitating the
02:29:59.359 worst of our fellow citizens because it
02:30:01.120 allows us to Silo more but I I mean the
02:30:03.200 way that I deal with that is I I just
02:30:04.359 try as hard as I can to remember that
02:30:05.920 most Americans This is what really
02:30:07.680 bothered me about what Biden said like
02:30:08.960 most Americans who vote for KLA Harris
02:30:10.640 are fundamentally good people like I I
02:30:12.279 believe that and you got to try to find
02:30:15.040 the people who are reasonable and talk
02:30:17.680 to them and that that's why I talk about
02:30:20.000 you know the importance of regaining
02:30:21.279 trust is just I've had enough
02:30:22.439 conversations with people who don't like
02:30:24.920 the Republican parties even their
02:30:27.120 perception of the Republican party's
02:30:28.760 views here that if you talk to
02:30:30.439 reasonable people you gain a different
02:30:32.080 perspective than if you talk to the
02:30:33.640 unreasonable people so I do that I think
02:30:35.960 a lot of people are only informed by
02:30:38.439 headlines and by real quick things that
02:30:41.399 they see on television and so they form
02:30:43.399 these narratives in their head and this
02:30:45.160 is what they're operating off of that's
02:30:46.800 absolutely right and this is why they
02:30:48.399 have this weird perception of both
02:30:51.040 Republicans and of trump and then they
02:30:52.920 start throwing these terms around like
02:30:54.520 fascism and white supremacy and well of
02:30:56.960 course you don't like fascism of course
02:30:58.520 you don't like white supremacy you can't
02:30:59.800 be a Republican and then next thing you
02:31:01.439 know you're on the other side and you
02:31:02.399 don't like how did you get me you
02:31:03.760 railroaded me [ __ ] and you guys are
02:31:06.640 you're censoring my Facebook what's
02:31:08.319 going on here and it's it's there's you
02:31:11.520 know there's not like a reasonable and
02:31:13.880 that's the the the one thing that I
02:31:15.439 think the Republican party has done
02:31:17.240 poorly is like be a little bit more
02:31:19.240 balanced and some of these controversial
02:31:21.080 social issues you know like the one
02:31:24.160 thing that people were worried about
02:31:25.479 right after uh roie Wade was gay
02:31:28.240 marriage and gay marriage laws and
02:31:30.840 people were thinking well it's religion
02:31:33.240 that overturned roie Wade and religion
02:31:35.640 is probably goingon to overturn these
02:31:37.920 May these gay marriage laws and people
02:31:40.240 are very terrified about that too yeah
02:31:41.840 and which is which obviously that's not
02:31:43.920 something we're trying to do but it's
02:31:45.640 interesting to me that how much people
02:31:47.200 focus on the religious element of it
02:31:48.720 because if you go back to the Rover
02:31:49.920 versus Wade debate you Ruth Bader
02:31:51.680 Ginsburg who was a feminist icon and was
02:31:54.439 very pro-choice she thought Ro versus
02:31:56.439 Wade was terrible law why did you think
02:31:58.920 that because I mean basically because of
02:32:01.000 the argument that often you know sort of
02:32:03.560 Republicans will use about making it a
02:32:05.160 state issue is she said look you can be
02:32:07.680 pro-choice as Ruth Bader Ginsburg was
02:32:10.200 but the avenue to make abortion policy
02:32:12.800 should be legislatures not judges so it
02:32:15.960 it was a procedural argument about how
02:32:17.560 the Constitution functioned where it's
02:32:19.560 funny like Ruth Bader Ginsburg actually
02:32:21.640 agreed with Donald Trump that even if
02:32:24.040 you know like that this should be a
02:32:26.319 States issue that the states should make
02:32:28.240 these decisions among their citizens and
02:32:30.960 it's telling that that perspective is
02:32:32.479 not Illustrated or highlighted but look
02:32:34.160 I I understand like people who aren't
02:32:36.160 you know I'm obviously a person of Faith
02:32:38.120 they don't want people of Faith to force
02:32:39.920 their values down people who don't agree
02:32:42.160 with them but I'm I'm sort of
02:32:43.680 comfortable with EV every one of us kind
02:32:46.680 of having our our Zone and within that
02:32:49.279 zone I don't want people to come in and
02:32:52.560 tell me what to do like in my home I'd
02:32:54.600 like to be able to raise my kids with my
02:32:56.560 religious values and I'd like to be able
02:32:58.600 to teach my kids what I think and you
02:33:00.040 should be able to teach your kids what
02:33:01.359 you think and then we recognize that the
02:33:03.160 more public The Zone the less that I can
02:33:05.560 get to control what you do and that's
02:33:07.960 part of living in a pluralistic society
02:33:10.200 and I'm very comfortable with that I
02:33:11.640 think unfortunately the modern left
02:33:14.200 seems to be less and less comfortable
02:33:16.040 even with people of Faith having their
02:33:17.600 own private zone right this is the trans
02:33:20.399 thing where it's like oh we're going to
02:33:21.479 take your kids away if you don't consent
02:33:23.560 to gender reassignment or you know we're
02:33:25.880 going to tell you that you can't send
02:33:27.200 your kids to a religious school you hear
02:33:29.040 people say these things again I think
02:33:30.520 it's the crazies it's not the majority
02:33:33.240 of our fellow citizens but part of
02:33:35.960 living in a pluralistic society is
02:33:37.840 accepting that every man's Castle or
02:33:40.600 every woman's Castle is his or her own
02:33:43.279 you've got to have respect for people
02:33:44.720 within those castles and then we should
02:33:47.000 hopefully just have some common sense
02:33:49.040 things that everybody can agree on when
02:33:50.880 we're talking about public spaces I
02:33:52.920 think for a lot of people worst case
02:33:55.479 scenario when they start thinking about
02:33:58.120 religious influence
02:34:01.520 on the way they're allowed to behave and
02:34:06.120 the the way their state is governed
02:34:08.600 worst case scenario is a state adopts
02:34:10.880 Sharia
02:34:12.319 law this is worst case scenario and I
02:34:15.439 think all these people that would cry
02:34:17.279 against the concept of islamophobia yeah
02:34:19.880 really need to understand what that
02:34:21.520 means and what you're talking about and
02:34:24.040 to say that that's an outrageous and
02:34:25.960 ridiculous idea that's never going to
02:34:27.279 take place it's kind of already worked
02:34:30.279 its way into some societies it has it
02:34:32.880 has and there are is it is it Minnesota
02:34:36.160 that has called to prayer like is it
02:34:38.479 Minneapolis I I don't know where I know
02:34:41.240 there is there is a place in Minnesota I
02:34:43.160 believe where they have prayer calls as
02:34:44.840 a matter of local government I do think
02:34:46.800 that's I do think that's happening that
02:34:48.359 starts getting real weird yeah stuff
02:34:50.600 like that starts getting real weird and
02:34:51.880 when you have people that are openly
02:34:53.319 saying our goal is and they've talked
02:34:56.120 about this in Toronto like activists
02:34:58.120 have said our goal is to outbreed
02:35:00.399 everyone who is not Muslim and vote it
02:35:03.640 out and and put Sharia law in place yeah
02:35:07.040 that's very scary women have to wear
02:35:08.359 burkas this is how it works yeah well
02:35:10.479 and that's I mean that's what to me is
02:35:12.040 so crazy about some of the hyper
02:35:14.520 leftwing reaction to you know the idea
02:35:16.880 that like somehow I want to force every
02:35:19.720 man woman and child to go to my church
02:35:21.200 is ridiculous I just don't want to do
02:35:22.840 that I've never had any interest in
02:35:24.080 doing that um but where you see actual
02:35:27.439 real religious tyranny is increasingly
02:35:30.920 in Western societies where you've had a
02:35:34.000 large influx of immigrants who don't
02:35:36.160 necessarily assimilate into Western
02:35:38.240 values but try to create I think a
02:35:41.640 religious tyranny at the local level and
02:35:44.200 if you think that won't happen at a
02:35:45.439 national level you're you're crazy did
02:35:47.160 you ever read Douglas Murray's book uh
02:35:49.240 the Str strange death of Europe um I
02:35:50.760 haven't read the whole thing but i' I've
02:35:52.160 read it in bits and pieces he's a smart
02:35:53.720 guy he got attacked so hard for that
02:35:56.240 because he was really like an early
02:35:58.000 Sounder he's the power R of this [ __ ]
02:36:00.000 well no dude one of the most
02:36:01.319 controversial things I've ever said is
02:36:03.439 what is the first islamist right CU it's
02:36:06.279 important to separate there are Muslims
02:36:08.439 who are not islamists right islamists
02:36:10.439 are like theocrats right right what is
02:36:13.439 the first islamist country that is going
02:36:16.399 to have a nuclear weapon and sort of
02:36:20.080 joked I said maybe it's going to be the
02:36:21.520 United Kingdom because they're so bad at
02:36:27.240 assimilating sort of newer immigrants
02:36:30.200 into their society you have definitely
02:36:32.160 communities in the UK where local
02:36:35.240 leaders are running explicitly on Sharia
02:36:38.240 law and winning elections in cities that
02:36:41.800 are in the United Kingdom right this is
02:36:43.279 England this is like where America came
02:36:45.399 from right there's a bunch of English uh
02:36:47.160 pilgrims who came to to to the United
02:36:49.080 States that to me is really crazy and
02:36:52.279 really scary and then of course
02:36:53.399 everybody said well you know Pakistan
02:36:55.479 already has nuclear weapons and my
02:36:57.000 response is well Pakistan isn't
02:36:58.359 necessarily an islamist country it's an
02:37:00.399 Islamic country they certainly have an
02:37:02.880 Islamic government and that's the
02:37:04.720 majority religion of the people but
02:37:06.479 Pakistan isn't going and saying we need
02:37:08.240 to like conquer the infidels at least
02:37:10.040 their government isn't we need to coner
02:37:11.920 conquer the infidels and force them to
02:37:13.560 obey our laws you see that more in among
02:37:17.080 some of the activists in the United
02:37:19.240 Kingdom om maybe than you do in in in
02:37:21.520 certain Arab countries and that's crazy
02:37:23.880 it is crazy but it it goes along with
02:37:27.040 this thing that we've been talking about
02:37:28.560 I think essentially people have sort of
02:37:31.080 a buil-in mode a program in their mind
02:37:34.319 that accepts religious doctrines and
02:37:37.359 these religious doctrines could be woke
02:37:40.160 it could be you know hardcore right-wing
02:37:42.359 Conservative Christian fundamentalism or
02:37:44.520 it could be Islamic Doctrine but we yeah
02:37:47.960 but this is why assimilation is so
02:37:49.720 important right is that look I'm married
02:37:54.080 to the daughter of immigrants I do think
02:37:56.240 that immigration can enrich this country
02:37:58.160 I do think that you know immigrants many
02:38:00.120 of them are bringing a lot of to the
02:38:03.120 table but we have to be honest with
02:38:06.000 ourselves that permitting 500,000
02:38:09.600 immigrants in a society like ours is
02:38:11.840 much different than permitting 5 million
02:38:14.680 or 50 million immigrants and importantly
02:38:17.479 where are the immigrants coming from
02:38:19.120 what are their values what are their
02:38:20.720 economic skills there's something what's
02:38:22.960 their criminal record what's their
02:38:23.880 criminal record there's something very
02:38:26.080 in in in sort of the modern again this
02:38:28.680 is a new thing because this is not Bill
02:38:30.439 Clinton liberalism this is something
02:38:31.880 that we're seeing today where they don't
02:38:33.640 even want to talk about the quality and
02:38:37.160 the backgrounds and the skills of people
02:38:39.560 coming to our country somehow it's
02:38:40.680 fundamentally racist to say well we
02:38:43.680 don't want certain people of certain
02:38:45.279 backgrounds to be in the United States
02:38:46.680 of America no it's just common sense I
02:38:49.600 mean let let me sort of give you a very
02:38:51.160 specific example okay so you know ask
02:38:55.359 yourself should America accept 100,000
02:38:59.600 immigrants from Mexico okay just in the
02:39:03.560 abstract well Mexico is a gigantic
02:39:07.000 country with Millions upon millions of
02:39:08.840 people who are we talking about are we
02:39:10.319 talking about people who speak English
02:39:12.600 as a second language and don't have
02:39:13.960 criminal backgrounds or are we talking
02:39:15.800 about people who don't even read and
02:39:17.120 write in Spanish and do have criminal
02:39:19.120 background grounds cuz those same groups
02:39:21.080 of people even though they come from the
02:39:22.479 country we call Mexico are going to
02:39:24.680 assimilate and contribute to America's
02:39:26.399 Society much differently there's
02:39:28.040 something in the modern liberal mind
02:39:30.279 that doesn't even allow you to ask the
02:39:31.840 question who does America benefit from
02:39:34.600 bringing into this country and if the
02:39:36.399 answer is we don't benefit then why
02:39:38.200 would we bring them into the country
02:39:39.800 well it's also this the concept of being
02:39:43.279 anti-open border somehow or another
02:39:46.319 became attached instead to of safety it
02:39:49.560 became attached to xenophobia it became
02:39:52.200 attached to racism and when you know you
02:39:55.479 confront people and say do you know that
02:39:57.359 Venezuela is literally opening their
02:39:59.840 prisons and instructing people to just
02:40:02.560 cross into America like no when you tell
02:40:06.160 the one of the wildest ones I think it
02:40:07.800 was you were having a conversation with
02:40:09.520 a woman we were discussing the gangs in
02:40:11.920 Aurora Colorado that have taken yeah and
02:40:15.359 she was like it's only a couple
02:40:17.479 buildings and imagine that's your your
02:40:19.439 community it's only a couple of
02:40:20.479 apartment complexes right with hundreds
02:40:22.120 of people that have been taken over by
02:40:24.000 Venezuelan gangs I I I think Joe the
02:40:26.520 right number apartment complexes taken
02:40:29.240 over by Venezuelan gangs is zero it's in
02:40:31.600 San Antonio too it's happening in San
02:40:33.240 Antonio it's happening everywhere it's
02:40:35.040 so crazy that people don't want to admit
02:40:38.080 to this because if they do it's
02:40:39.479 empowering the right and they think it's
02:40:41.399 going to help Donald Trump get elected
02:40:43.439 so they're turning a blind eye to
02:40:45.560 dangerous criminals crossing the border
02:40:48.279 with no recurse no tracking you can't do
02:40:51.880 anything about it well you see this in
02:40:53.040 some communities where because they're
02:40:54.760 small towns and because rapid migrant
02:40:57.920 influx can happen very quickly where the
02:41:00.200 town population has been doubled okay so
02:41:03.319 you don't even have to assume people are
02:41:04.560 criminals what does it do to the local
02:41:06.720 public school when all of a sudden a
02:41:09.160 thousand newcomers show up that don't
02:41:11.040 even speak English right what does it do
02:41:13.040 to the hospital system when you now have
02:41:15.160 thousands of people in a small Health
02:41:16.840 Care system that are showing up to get
02:41:18.520 emergency servic
02:41:19.880 because they don't have access otherwise
02:41:21.319 to a doctor and now the American
02:41:23.160 citizens have to wait in line for 7
02:41:25.200 hours to get to see a doctor because
02:41:28.000 we've overwhelmed the local hospital
02:41:29.600 system what does it do to housing prices
02:41:31.080 we've seen this in a number of
02:41:32.040 communities including those that I
02:41:33.920 represent in Ohio when you bring in
02:41:35.800 thousands upon thousands of people you
02:41:37.880 cannot build enough houses quickly
02:41:39.520 enough to accommodate that so the cost
02:41:41.680 of housing becomes unaffordable for
02:41:43.640 American citizens it is the craziest
02:41:46.000 thing that we've seen in this country
02:41:48.399 that you don't even allow people to talk
02:41:51.000 about the effects of mass migration
02:41:53.000 anymore and that's why I think it's one
02:41:55.000 of the reasons why Donald Trump is going
02:41:56.359 to be elected president or at least
02:41:57.640 should be elected president because he's
02:41:59.240 one of the few guys who's saying you
02:42:00.399 know what no no no we're going to talk
02:42:01.840 about this problem yes some immigrants
02:42:04.120 are good some immigrants are not good
02:42:06.319 and that is an obvious insight to
02:42:08.279 anybody who knows human nature what do
02:42:10.439 you think is the goal behind allowing
02:42:13.439 this to take place now first of all one
02:42:14.800 of the things that KLA Harris has said
02:42:16.560 was that there was a bill that could
02:42:18.319 have fixed the Border problem but that
02:42:20.240 Donald Trump did not want it to take
02:42:22.960 place because he wanted to keep this as
02:42:25.000 a political talking point totally
02:42:26.600 dishonest totally dishonest what was the
02:42:28.800 bill okay here was the bill what
02:42:31.399 happened is okay let me talk about what
02:42:34.760 the bill does first of all okay number
02:42:36.760 one is it sets a maximum cap on the
02:42:40.120 number of illegal immigrants that we can
02:42:41.720 have before the Border shuts down that
02:42:44.560 maximum cap is 2 million illegal aliens
02:42:47.520 per year it's like 1.85 million to be
02:42:50.120 more precise that's number one it did
02:42:52.720 number two it codified what's called
02:42:55.200 Catch and Release where a person comes
02:42:57.240 into our country they're an illegal
02:42:58.520 immigrant but they say no no no I'm not
02:43:00.040 an illegal immigrant I'm an asylum
02:43:01.680 seeker and so their claim for Asylum
02:43:04.760 gets adjudicated but because there's a
02:43:06.479 backlog because we have so many there
02:43:09.000 their their claim isn't going to be
02:43:10.120 adjudicated for 15 years so rather than
02:43:12.920 having that person wait in Mexico we
02:43:15.080 give them a work permit and we give them
02:43:17.000 legal status and we let them come into
02:43:18.720 the United States States of America
02:43:19.800 that's called Catch and Release Donald
02:43:21.920 Trump's policy was you have to wait in
02:43:23.399 Mexico we're not going to catch you and
02:43:25.319 then release you into the country for 15
02:43:26.880 years it codified that in other words
02:43:29.680 even if Donald Trump became president
02:43:31.240 and this is why he really hated it is
02:43:33.040 that he would not be able to undo Catch
02:43:34.720 and Release if he won the election it
02:43:37.160 would be codified into American law
02:43:39.640 third thing it did nothing on the border
02:43:41.600 wall nothing on an immigration system
02:43:44.000 called parole which is supposed to be a
02:43:46.359 case by case you grant parole to people
02:43:49.120 people who are fleeing tyranny but
02:43:52.800 Harris has used parole to the tune of
02:43:54.640 millions upon Millions Mass parole whole
02:43:57.760 categories of country have been paroled
02:44:00.240 into the United States it didn't do
02:44:01.439 anything to solve that problem so it
02:44:03.080 wasn't a border security bill it was an
02:44:04.920 amnesty bill now in addition to what I
02:44:07.640 just said it also gave some table scraps
02:44:09.840 to border patrol that and that that is
02:44:12.040 what allows them to hinge onto that one
02:44:14.479 thing and to say it's a border it's a
02:44:16.240 border security Bill no no no no no it
02:44:18.200 was a mass amnesty bill would have made
02:44:20.200 the Border problem 10 times worse and
02:44:22.640 that's why they ultimately uh pushed it
02:44:25.960 and that's why Republicans fought
02:44:27.319 against it by the way like six Democrats
02:44:29.720 uh voted against that piece of
02:44:30.880 legislation because they thought it was
02:44:32.080 kind of a disaster so it was not a
02:44:34.240 bipartisan border Bill and in fact it
02:44:35.680 was much more bipartisan the opposition
02:44:37.760 to the legislation but it has allowed
02:44:39.640 kamla Harris to go around and
02:44:41.040 dishonestly claim that she cares about
02:44:42.720 the southern border even though when she
02:44:44.840 came into office they bragged about
02:44:47.160 undoing all of Donald Trump's successful
02:44:49.240 border policies they did exactly that
02:44:51.560 and then we had the massive migrant
02:44:53.040 Invasion that we've seen over the last
02:44:54.160 three years and I think it was good on
02:44:55.880 you in the debate with Tim Waltz when
02:44:58.600 they fact checked you they tried to fact
02:45:00.560 you check you and say that this has
02:45:02.040 always been in place and you stepped up
02:45:03.960 and said no no no this app is new and
02:45:06.880 this app was specifically used for
02:45:08.640 shipping yes and now they're using it to
02:45:11.439 schedule people to illegally come come
02:45:13.600 into the country so but here's the
02:45:15.560 question why why is this happening what
02:45:18.240 do you think I mean obviously
02:45:19.880 speculation a little bit but what do you
02:45:21.240 think the motivation of allowing this to
02:45:23.479 take place and the disproportionate
02:45:25.640 number of people that have moved to
02:45:26.640 swing states which is also like a little
02:45:29.520 suspicious um so depends on how many how
02:45:33.720 many tinf foil hats do you have in this
02:45:35.279 room dude I got a wardrobe we can get
02:45:38.240 real serious about this real quick or
02:45:40.040 pretty pretty crazy very quickly look I
02:45:41.920 think what is obvious is and I've seen
02:45:44.399 this in the halls of Congress I've seen
02:45:45.680 it very explicitly you talk about
02:45:46.960 lobbying and we obviously talked about
02:45:48.720 the context of other Industries there is
02:45:51.080 a massive corporate Lobby for cheap
02:45:52.920 labor in the United States of America
02:45:55.120 and that is I think the main thing
02:45:56.960 that's going on think about this if
02:45:58.279 you've got millions of illegal aliens
02:46:00.960 okay let me tell you a story in 2017
02:46:03.600 2018 when I was in the private sector I
02:46:06.080 was at a a business conference dinner
02:46:09.120 and I was seated next to the CEO of one
02:46:12.200 of the largest hotel chains in America
02:46:14.040 this is I think probably 2018 and the
02:46:16.359 guy is going on and on about how much he
02:46:18.120 hates Donald Trump and I'm like oh
02:46:19.760 that's interesting like why do you hate
02:46:20.840 Donald Trump so much cuz again I was I
02:46:22.680 was sort of a trump skeptic in 2015 and
02:46:25.560 at this point I was kind of you know
02:46:26.880 starting to really get get on the Trump
02:46:28.439 train and he said well the reason as I
02:46:31.359 the reason I hate Donald Trump he says
02:46:32.920 is because Donald Trump's border
02:46:35.600 policies have cut down the number of
02:46:37.840 illegal immigrants and because I can't
02:46:40.160 pay illegal immigrants under the table
02:46:41.760 anymore I have to pay American workers
02:46:43.920 and they want much higher wages and I
02:46:45.800 was like this guy just admitted it I was
02:46:47.640 like holy [ __ ] this guy just aded
02:46:50.960 that is like straight up
02:46:53.160 Monopoly man evil [ __ ] that this guy
02:46:56.680 admitted to and I was like you know my
02:46:58.800 my wife who's very apolitical she was
02:47:00.880 actually at the dinner with me and she's
02:47:01.920 like come again you just said you don't
02:47:05.200 want Americans to get decent wages like
02:47:08.120 that is the best argument for Donald
02:47:09.720 Trump's immigration policy is that
02:47:11.720 American workers are getting higher
02:47:13.120 wages and this is why this corporate CEO
02:47:15.680 hates it so whatever the industry is
02:47:17.399 you've got a lot of people who want
02:47:19.160 cheap labor and they don't want to pay
02:47:21.359 American workers higher wages that's a
02:47:23.080 big part of it I do think there's also a
02:47:25.560 power Dynamic to it in particular I
02:47:27.399 think kamla Harris and the Democrats
02:47:29.359 they want to give these millions upon
02:47:30.800 millions of illegal aliens the right to
02:47:32.600 vote they want to legalize them they
02:47:34.880 want to make it easier for them to
02:47:35.920 participate in our elections and that
02:47:37.840 means fundamentally the end of American
02:47:39.640 democracy because you're talking about
02:47:41.160 25 million people here if KLA Harris
02:47:43.600 gives 10 million of those people legal
02:47:45.439 status and allows them to vote in
02:47:47.160 American elections then you know say say
02:47:49.880 say 7030 they go Democrat Republicans
02:47:52.520 will never win a national election in
02:47:53.680 this country in my
02:47:54.880 lifetime and the only way to get them on
02:47:58.439 your side was be would be the
02:48:00.520 Republicans offer the same services and
02:48:03.760 maybe even be more generous in letting
02:48:06.680 illegals in exactly I mean You' have to
02:48:09.600 literally beat them at their own game
02:48:11.680 like I'm going to give you a free house
02:48:13.120 yeah no I mean yeah you know lifetime is
02:48:15.399 probably overstating it but you'd have
02:48:16.560 to it would take 30 years for the
02:48:18.319 Republic
02:48:19.279 to get to a point where we could even
02:48:20.720 compete with these these newcomers but
02:48:23.040 again it will have degraded the voting
02:48:24.920 power of the people who have the legal
02:48:26.240 right to be here and States blue forever
02:48:30.359 the same way they've done California
02:48:32.080 exactly and we saw this and look I'm I'm
02:48:33.880 like a Reagan guy right I'm a
02:48:35.040 Conservative Republican um but Reagan
02:48:37.279 screwed up a lot he screwed up mental
02:48:39.000 health in this country people don't talk
02:48:40.520 nearly enough about that the amnesty
02:48:41.800 thing he really screwed up amnesty thing
02:48:43.319 he really screwed up and people always
02:48:45.479 say well you know Ronald Reagan you know
02:48:47.720 when they CR of of Donald Trump will say
02:48:50.279 well look at how Reagan talked about
02:48:52.439 immigration because of what Ronald
02:48:54.319 Reagan did at the 1986 amnesty
02:48:57.399 California is now effectively a
02:48:59.120 permanently Blue State except when
02:49:01.160 Arnold won but Arnold ran as a super
02:49:04.880 moderate Republican he was a major
02:49:07.120 celebrity right he was at the height of
02:49:08.479 his celebrity power and he still he
02:49:10.399 still won barely even though California
02:49:12.840 had been
02:49:13.680 mismanaged California is a one party
02:49:15.840 State because of Ronald Reagan's amnesty
02:49:18.200 and that's the fear is that the entire
02:49:19.800 country could become one part the entire
02:49:21.200 country becomes that now it also you may
02:49:23.600 not appreciate this but even if you
02:49:25.120 don't give people the right to vote it
02:49:27.040 really distorts Congressional
02:49:29.040 apportionment and then the Electoral
02:49:30.720 College you know how this works yes I do
02:49:32.640 but explain it to people please okay so
02:49:35.479 how many you know we have 435
02:49:37.720 congressional seats who the way that you
02:49:41.080 draw those congressional districts is
02:49:42.520 that you try to draw them evenly based
02:49:45.120 on population so that everybody has
02:49:46.960 equal representation right one person
02:49:48.720 one vote fundamental principle of
02:49:50.160 American law but you don't just count
02:49:51.960 the American citizens you also count the
02:49:54.200 illegal aliens and so for example the
02:49:56.239 state of Ohio lost a congressional seat
02:49:58.319 in the last census and states that have
02:50:01.439 high illegal immigrant populations
02:50:03.080 picked up congressional seats so you're
02:50:05.040 actually taking away congressional
02:50:07.000 representation from American citizens
02:50:09.760 and giving it to illegal aliens even if
02:50:11.640 you don't give them the right to vote
02:50:13.160 you're still destroying the voting power
02:50:15.600 of American citizens because it's based
02:50:16.920 on population because it's based on
02:50:18.040 population including illegal immigrants
02:50:20.160 is there a way to change it so that it's
02:50:22.359 only based on legal American citizens
02:50:25.359 well Donald Trump tried a proposal that
02:50:28.120 Democrats went nuts over and litigated
02:50:31.600 was litigated in the courts so we would
02:50:33.120 have to try again that would ask
02:50:35.920 citizenship status during the US Census
02:50:39.200 the idea being that if you ask more
02:50:41.359 people their citizenship status you get
02:50:43.960 fewer people who are answering that
02:50:45.479 question I think that we should make it
02:50:46.880 and I and I do think this this would
02:50:48.120 require an of Congress but I think that
02:50:50.239 it would be constitutional is we should
02:50:52.720 just say that illegal aliens are not
02:50:54.720 counted for purposes of congressional
02:50:56.760 representation yeah I mean Democrats
02:50:58.920 would call that racist but it's just
02:51:00.880 common sense policy well especially if
02:51:02.520 it's been shown that you're manipulating
02:51:04.040 it by moving more people to these places
02:51:06.200 and even if they're not legal citizens
02:51:08.200 and they can't vote it still counts as
02:51:10.720 congressional seats correct that's kind
02:51:12.520 of crazy that's exactly right it doesn't
02:51:15.479 I the the one that drives me the most
02:51:17.319 crazy is this idea a that somehow or
02:51:19.520 another uh it's discriminatory to
02:51:22.319 require ID to vote nuts that could only
02:51:26.319 me I've tried to look at this from the
02:51:29.439 most charitable position outside of it
02:51:31.840 only makes sense if you're trying to
02:51:32.960 cheat that's exactly right this you need
02:51:35.359 an ID for everything you need an ID to
02:51:38.399 rent a car well you know it's basically
02:51:39.920 illegal now in California to ask for
02:51:42.560 voter ID which is crazy which is totally
02:51:44.800 insane but you know my my my view and I
02:51:47.720 I'm sure you got many many listeners in
02:51:49.680 the great state of California the next
02:51:52.040 time you're pulled over by a police
02:51:53.560 officer just tell them that you're on
02:51:55.279 your way to vote I've seen that me I
02:51:57.640 mean think about this but you you can't
02:52:00.960 if you can't require people to show
02:52:02.600 voter ID then I think you're inviting
02:52:04.680 fraud into your system and there's also
02:52:06.200 something implicitly very racist about
02:52:08.239 this because what they say is voter ID
02:52:11.160 means that black people aren't going to
02:52:12.640 vote well number one if you look at
02:52:15.359 polls the same level of support for
02:52:18.720 voter ID exists in the black community
02:52:20.359 is in the white Community it's about 75
02:52:21.960 80% of blacks 75 80% of whites support
02:52:24.760 voter ID but they're basically saying
02:52:26.880 that black people can't get
02:52:28.040 identification when they say that voter
02:52:30.080 ID is racist they're implicitly saying
02:52:32.040 black people can't get identification I
02:52:33.880 think that's an actual racist concept
02:52:36.560 concept I actually assume that my fellow
02:52:39.640 or or or the black citizens are my
02:52:41.279 fellow Americans and they can do the
02:52:42.920 same thing that every other citizen can
02:52:44.160 do which is good identification yeah
02:52:46.040 it's fundamentally just gaslighting it's
02:52:49.040 yeah that's right that's all it is it's
02:52:50.399 just you're trying hard to make your
02:52:52.319 point because you want people to be able
02:52:54.000 to vote that maybe shouldn't be voting
02:52:56.040 and then there's all these lawsuits
02:52:57.399 where they're counting votes that they
02:52:59.359 know to be illegitimate well they're
02:53:01.160 saying that there's a certain amount of
02:53:03.000 people that are in the system that
02:53:04.920 they're going to they want to keep in
02:53:06.640 there yeah which is crazy so you're
02:53:08.479 saying you want people that shouldn't be
02:53:09.920 allowed to vote to vote no they say that
02:53:12.120 they don't want illegal aliens or
02:53:13.840 illegal voters to vote the Harris
02:53:15.920 Administration right now is litigating a
02:53:18.239 law suit against the governor of
02:53:19.800 Virginia because the governor of
02:53:21.520 Virginia using a state law kicked about
02:53:24.800 1,500 people or maybe 6,500 but it was
02:53:27.479 it was some some number of people off
02:53:29.359 the Virginia voter roles because they
02:53:31.399 checked a box that said they were
02:53:33.479 non-citizen well if you're non-citizen
02:53:35.200 you can't be on the voter roles so he
02:53:37.120 kicked all of the non-citizens off the
02:53:39.399 voter roles Harris is suing Glenn yunan
02:53:43.080 the the department of justice under
02:53:44.560 kamla Harris is suing him to ensure that
02:53:47.080 those voters go back on the V rules
02:53:49.120 there's no argument any sense there's no
02:53:52.239 argument for this other than you want to
02:53:54.319 facilitate cheating but the fact that
02:53:56.120 the left has no problem with this
02:53:57.520 because they just want to win is insane
02:53:59.680 but who's going to hold their feet to
02:54:00.600 the fire who's going to tell the honest
02:54:01.960 truth the American Media has barely even
02:54:04.200 covered the fact that in the middle of a
02:54:06.239 very consequential presidental
02:54:08.239 presidential election kamla Harris's
02:54:10.359 Department of Justice is suing to keep
02:54:13.399 illegal voters on the voter
02:54:16.840 roles it's crazy it's wild so it's like
02:54:20.200 for Trump to win he has to win by an
02:54:23.319 enormous margin he has to overcome a lot
02:54:26.520 of this Shenanigans well as president
02:54:28.080 Trump says we want to make it too big to
02:54:30.040 rig uh I I I look I encourage all of
02:54:33.000 your listeners whether you agree with us
02:54:35.000 on all the issues or not if you agree
02:54:36.319 with censorship then vote kamla Harris
02:54:38.720 and if you think Americans should be
02:54:39.800 able to say what they want to say then
02:54:40.960 get out there and vote vote early vote
02:54:43.000 by mail like that's obviously part of
02:54:44.880 the reason why I'm here is I want to get
02:54:47.160 people out there to vote because I do
02:54:49.319 think that we need to overwhelm the
02:54:50.920 system with so many voters that we
02:54:54.200 ensure that we get the representative
02:54:56.200 government that we actually deserve as a
02:54:57.560 country and that's not going to happen
02:54:58.560 unless people get out there and vote is
02:55:00.120 one of the things that I think is an
02:55:02.000 important issue that kind of gets put
02:55:03.800 aside is I know a lot of veterans in
02:55:07.359 particular and a lot of people with uh
02:55:09.479 some severe trauma that have had uh
02:55:12.800 psychedelic therapy and they've had to
02:55:14.720 go to other countries to do it they've
02:55:16.920 they've done some of it illegally in
02:55:18.960 America but I know far too many guys who
02:55:23.439 have had PTSD who have had an incredible
02:55:27.600 experience and been alleviated of all
02:55:30.279 these and this helped them the helped
02:55:32.279 them tremendously what is it is it like
02:55:34.319 MDMA or is it what MDMA was what Maps
02:55:37.200 was using they were running these
02:55:38.800 studies and they got they they got close
02:55:41.840 to FDA approval but then now they're
02:55:44.200 being sent back to say they have to do
02:55:45.880 more studies the problem is like you
02:55:47.479 can't really do blind Placebo controled
02:55:49.720 studies on MDMA either you're on it or
02:55:52.200 you're not on it it's pretty obvious you
02:55:54.840 know yeah sugar pills don't have the
02:55:56.560 same effects yeah it just doesn't but
02:55:58.640 the therapy for people that are
02:56:00.640 suffering from severe PTSD has been
02:56:03.399 incredibly beneficial they've shown that
02:56:05.760 with the map studies but they've also
02:56:07.200 shown it with like anecdotally I know a
02:56:09.760 bunch of different guys that have gone
02:56:11.359 down to Mexico and had psilocybin
02:56:13.399 Journeys and all these different things
02:56:14.760 where they've
02:56:16.479 encountered these experience es that
02:56:19.000 have made them sort of rethink who they
02:56:21.439 are alleviated them of a lot of the
02:56:23.800 stress and a lot of the the the trauma
02:56:26.080 that they've experienced and given them
02:56:28.080 peace and the the the the concept of
02:56:31.160 schedule one is that there's no medical
02:56:32.920 benefit right and if these people are
02:56:35.279 experiencing first of all C cessation of
02:56:37.520 smoking people that have had issues with
02:56:39.760 addiction I beain treatments another one
02:56:42.560 that they've found which is not
02:56:44.880 something that anyone would ever abuse
02:56:46.880 recreationally I've never done on it but
02:56:48.640 apparently it's an excruciating
02:56:50.239 experience but the uh rate of curing
02:56:54.279 addiction is tremendous from it and
02:56:57.319 these things have been denied uh a
02:57:00.479 people have had denied access to it
02:57:02.239 because of this scheduling issue huh
02:57:05.239 like there's a like we we discussed it
02:57:07.760 yesterday on the podcast like the ld50
02:57:09.760 rate was like lethal dose at 50% is
02:57:12.399 impossible to achieve with silin and yet
02:57:14.960 it's still illegal and that there's all
02:57:17.520 these people that have reported Sid
02:57:20.120 mushrooms right yes okay and you know
02:57:22.520 but you can synthesize it it doesn't
02:57:24.200 have to be I see but
02:57:26.359 the the scheduling of these things in
02:57:29.239 particularly like marijuana like
02:57:30.600 marijuana is legal on a state level with
02:57:33.720 I think almost half the country now if
02:57:35.560 not more yeah but yet federally illegal
02:57:38.640 and if you go to the history of why it
02:57:40.760 was federally illegal in the first place
02:57:42.800 it coincides with the U what happened
02:57:45.800 with prohibition of alcohol right after
02:57:47.560 prohibition of alcohol they turned their
02:57:49.600 eyes to marijuana and there was a lot of
02:57:51.479 political influence by Harry anslinger
02:57:53.600 and William Randolph Hurst and there's a
02:57:55.680 lot of maneuvering and that's where the
02:57:57.239 reform Madness films came up and all
02:57:59.000 this propaganda stuff it was to make it
02:58:00.920 illegal essentially to to make the
02:58:03.880 textile the the hemp
02:58:06.880 illegal interesting okay there's a long
02:58:09.680 history to it we can get it's basically
02:58:11.600 more about the commodity of hemp that it
02:58:14.080 was really about the drug itself in fact
02:58:16.359 the the term marijuana was never used
02:58:19.120 for cannabis which has been used for
02:58:21.319 thousands and thousands of years the
02:58:22.520 term marijuana was created by William
02:58:25.880 Randol Hurst and put in Hurst newspapers
02:58:27.960 it was originally marijuana was a
02:58:29.840 Mexican slang word for a wild tobacco
02:58:33.040 really it had nothing so they started
02:58:34.560 writing these stories about blacks and
02:58:36.880 Mexicans smoking this new drug marijuana
02:58:39.920 and raping white women and most of this
02:58:43.319 was I had no idea this history it's so
02:58:45.319 crazy the story is so nuts but it all
02:58:46.960 came about because of a uh an invention
02:58:49.279 called the decorticator and the
02:58:51.200 decorticator is uh it's an invention
02:58:54.080 that allows them to economically and
02:58:56.439 effectively process hemp fiber without
02:58:58.760 slave labor so when the cotton gin came
02:59:01.040 along people stopped using hemp as much
02:59:03.640 because it's much more difficult to work
02:59:05.200 with and they started using cotton for
02:59:07.040 clothing but before that they' use hemp
02:59:09.840 and this is nonpsychoactive hemp yeah it
02:59:12.479 makes a superior paper it does there's
02:59:15.479 there's a bunch of uses for it
02:59:17.000 completely outside of the active aspect
02:59:18.960 of it William Rand there was the cover
02:59:21.160 of was it Popular Science magazine
02:59:23.479 Popular Mechanics magazine hemp the new
02:59:25.640 billion doll crop and it was all about
02:59:27.760 this invention so then the propaganda
02:59:30.160 machine goes into full scale and then
02:59:32.200 they start this was in the 1930s okay so
02:59:34.600 they start here it is the new billion
02:59:36.439 doll crop 1938 and this is because of
02:59:39.120 this invention the
02:59:40.520 decorticator so solves a problem you can
02:59:42.800 see it there solves a problem more than
02:59:44.359 6,000 years old hemp a crop that would
02:59:46.000 not compete with other American products
02:59:47.800 and instead it will displace Imports of
02:59:49.520 raw material and manufactured products
02:59:51.640 produced by underpaid coie and peasant
02:59:53.600 labor provide thousands of jobs for
02:59:55.520 American workers throughout the land so
02:59:57.040 everybody was really high on hemp as a
02:59:59.080 commodity because of this new machine
03:00:02.000 that you could process hemp fiber with
03:00:03.560 where you can make much more Superior
03:00:05.439 paper Superior clothing like it's like
03:00:08.560 canvas literally the mon Lisa was
03:00:10.479 painted on hemp the first draft the
03:00:12.720 Declaration of Independence was written
03:00:14.200 on hemp they used to use it for paper
03:00:15.560 back then so then brandol Hurst who owns
03:00:19.279 Hurst publication and also owns all
03:00:21.640 these paper mills and forests filled
03:00:23.560 with trees okay so they go back to the
03:00:27.560 financial exactly and so we're still
03:00:30.279 trapped under this propaganda that was
03:00:33.479 distributed in the 1930s by incredibly
03:00:36.040 powerful people yeah and this is why
03:00:38.359 it's illegal on the federal level and
03:00:40.239 even though you have medical marijuana
03:00:42.200 that's been showed to help people with
03:00:43.840 chemotherapy and wasting disease help
03:00:46.200 people that have appetite problem and
03:00:48.520 people in chronic pain it's still listed
03:00:50.920 as a schedule run drug federally which
03:00:53.760 to me is unconscionable it doesn't make
03:00:55.680 any sense okay so like first of all
03:00:59.640 we're not trying to be clear because I'm
03:01:01.399 speaking as a vice presidental candidate
03:01:02.640 we're not trying to throw people in jail
03:01:05.439 for smoking weed that's like very much
03:01:07.239 Something That We're Not Just in doing
03:01:09.359 um what is I mean the one thing that I
03:01:12.920 have like my attitude on this stuff is
03:01:14.600 kind of Live and Let Live Like keep it
03:01:16.439 in your home I don't like smelling it
03:01:17.920 when I take my kids to the park right
03:01:20.640 keep Dy what's that yeah exactly um but
03:01:24.520 like you know keep it at home I don't
03:01:25.600 want to throw people in prison that's
03:01:26.680 not what we're trying to do I don't
03:01:28.160 think you should be drunk at the park
03:01:29.399 either right exactly exactly same same
03:01:31.560 exact principle the the the thing that I
03:01:34.080 wonder about is if you you know I I I do
03:01:39.960 there's a part of me that worries a
03:01:40.960 little bit about kids doing a lot of
03:01:42.840 this stuff and I wonder you know to your
03:01:44.600 point about consent and the brains
03:01:46.439 development and all these things really
03:01:48.120 worry about do you have an increase in
03:01:50.040 usage among minors and so what I'd like
03:01:52.359 to get is is some sort of legal regime
03:01:54.520 that you know again it's not like
03:01:56.640 criminally Prosecuting or Prosecuting at
03:01:58.479 all people for smoking a joint but also
03:02:01.160 where we can actually ensure that it's
03:02:02.640 kept out of public spaces that's kind of
03:02:04.720 my attitude towards it and I think
03:02:06.800 that's the right the right approach I
03:02:07.920 mean on the Psychedelic thing what is
03:02:10.680 like what would need to be
03:02:12.319 done cuz I I know to be clear I know
03:02:15.120 absolutely nothing about this so this is
03:02:16.840 me you know asking a question not
03:02:19.399 committing to some public policy you had
03:02:21.399 to be careful with this stuff especially
03:02:23.000 six days from an election but I had
03:02:24.960 never heard about you know because I'm a
03:02:27.439 veteran too I served four years in the
03:02:28.479 united Marine Corps went to Iraq uh went
03:02:30.680 to Haiti once and is there any
03:02:35.439 like like what is the pathway I guess or
03:02:38.000 what do you think should happen for
03:02:40.760 veterans accessing psychedelics well
03:02:43.479 there's so many anecdotal stories about
03:02:45.720 veterans experiencing relief that I
03:02:47.680 think think it should be available to
03:02:49.040 them uh especially veterans I think that
03:02:52.200 we put our veterans through but is it
03:02:54.560 like an FDA thing as making it possible
03:02:56.520 for them to get the therapy okay yes and
03:02:58.120 it's also the way it's scheduled you
03:03:00.800 know it's because it's schedule one
03:03:02.680 isn't it but like like if it had a
03:03:04.200 medical use presly you would get it off
03:03:06.040 of schedule one yes so why aren't we and
03:03:08.760 I'm just fascinated by this this is the
03:03:09.920 first time I've heard about this why
03:03:11.239 aren't we testing whether there is yeah
03:03:15.640 Fair Point you can't do a double blind
03:03:17.359 placebo controlled study but you can
03:03:19.720 definitely still study whether this
03:03:21.520 helps people or not why aren't we doing
03:03:24.319 that or are we doing that I'm just not
03:03:25.479 aware of it well we're definitely not
03:03:27.000 doing it I mean there's been some
03:03:28.479 research John Hopkins did some research
03:03:30.960 on psychedelics and theyve found similar
03:03:33.160 benefits there's also dangers like uh
03:03:35.840 any anything that has profound effects
03:03:38.960 on the human mind there's certain people
03:03:40.520 that are very vulnerable and those
03:03:42.560 people should not be taking these things
03:03:44.160 there's people that have a hard time
03:03:45.200 with regular reality you know they're
03:03:46.840 barely hanging on regularly yeah and but
03:03:49.680 I think the people that are not should
03:03:51.479 have access to that because I believe in
03:03:53.080 Freedom and I and I believe in the
03:03:54.680 freedom to explore things that have
03:03:57.000 great benefits and I keep going back to
03:03:59.239 Veterans because I think we require an
03:04:02.640 insane thing of them we take regular
03:04:05.640 people who live in civilized society we
03:04:07.960 send them over to Afghanistan and Iraq
03:04:10.880 and have them engaged in the absolutely
03:04:13.920 most brutal thing that people do which
03:04:15.960 is war they see their friends blown
03:04:18.239 apart they get shot they see people die
03:04:20.560 they have to kill people and then they
03:04:22.399 come back here and then they're supposed
03:04:24.000 to just acclimate Y and there's no
03:04:26.520 guidelines there's no way to do it
03:04:28.040 there's no no one can coach you through
03:04:29.880 it and a lot of these guys wind up
03:04:31.920 killing themselves and it's it's a very
03:04:33.880 high amount and you know Shawn Ryan you
03:04:36.840 have you done his show yeah love Shan
03:04:38.279 Ryan Love Shawn Ryan Shawn Ryan was
03:04:40.680 talking about the experience that it had
03:04:42.120 with him completely changed his life he
03:04:44.120 stopped drinking he became a much more
03:04:47.000 compassionate sensitive person we talked
03:04:48.880 about like foreign policy and and
03:04:50.279 Veteran stuff but we didn't talk about
03:04:51.640 this that's the guy's in Navy SEAL I
03:04:53.040 mean he's seen a lot of [ __ ] he's seen a
03:04:54.479 lot of [ __ ] right I mean it's just
03:04:56.200 that's the job and you come back over
03:04:57.920 here and you're supposed to just be
03:04:59.000 normal and there's no help at least for
03:05:01.760 those people I know like look I my
03:05:05.040 attitude is we should help veterans get
03:05:07.680 the mental health they need meal mental
03:05:09.880 health treatment they need and be less
03:05:12.840 screwed up by all this stuff we should
03:05:14.960 be doing whatever we can I guess I just
03:05:16.960 don't understand why aren't we like is
03:05:18.359 this a Pharma lobbying thing is this a
03:05:21.640 bureaucratic screwed up thing like
03:05:23.399 because I'm always wondering like what
03:05:24.680 what why are we not actually solving
03:05:26.080 problems and this is a problem I know
03:05:28.040 nothing about sorry I know a lot about
03:05:30.880 veteran suicides and Veteran mental
03:05:32.479 health this this proposed solution like
03:05:35.520 literally the first time you get real
03:05:37.080 cynical as to what's the resistance you
03:05:39.000 could say the companies that make
03:05:41.399 psychotropic drugs uh ssris and the like
03:05:45.120 and companies that have a vested
03:05:46.840 interest in continuing to sell these
03:05:48.479 things would not want something that
03:05:50.800 causes people to have a profound
03:05:53.479 psychological change that doesn't
03:05:55.359 require them to be on these things
03:05:56.960 anymore there could be an impact in that
03:05:59.160 but I think there's also a lot of
03:06:00.760 ignorance yeah have you read this book
03:06:02.760 bad therapy no okay it's good I've heard
03:06:05.640 it's good yeah I haven't heard it though
03:06:07.720 so the mental health thing in the United
03:06:10.439 States is really really worrisome
03:06:13.920 because you know when I when I talk
03:06:15.640 about obviously we have a big gun
03:06:16.840 violence problem you unit States of
03:06:18.000 America and I talk about mental health
03:06:19.800 because obviously that's a part of
03:06:21.279 what's going on here it's what they say
03:06:24.080 is well every other country has mental
03:06:26.040 health meaning Advocates of strict gun
03:06:28.399 laws say every other country has mental
03:06:29.760 health problems but they don't have the
03:06:31.640 same gun violence problem that we do
03:06:33.239 it's actually not totally true if you
03:06:35.359 look at like SSRI prescriptions uh
03:06:37.880 selective serotonin and reuptake
03:06:39.319 Inhibitors it's like Prozac that
03:06:41.439 category of mental health Therapeutics
03:06:44.200 we take something like six times as much
03:06:47.040 as are peer countries economically so
03:06:49.760 clearly there's something with mental
03:06:52.000 health treatment in the United States
03:06:53.279 that is very very broken there's also a
03:06:55.520 direct correlation between School
03:06:56.760 shooters Mass Shooters and ssris really
03:07:00.399 yeah oh yeah like most of the people
03:07:03.600 that have com that have committed mass
03:07:05.920 shootings and not talking about gang
03:07:07.560 shootings but a bunch of them are on
03:07:10.279 psychotropic drugs and everybody wants
03:07:12.800 to blame drugs oh yeah Google it because
03:07:16.040 you you can find out what the numbers I
03:07:17.239 know Coline kids were on psychotropic
03:07:19.680 drugs I know there's been a ton of
03:07:21.399 School shooters prescribed talking about
03:07:24.239 weed no no no prescribed psychotropic
03:07:27.160 drugs prescribed psych psychiatric drugs
03:07:31.760 and that if you bring that up you are
03:07:35.319 taking away from the this argument they
03:07:37.479 want to say where they want to blame
03:07:38.479 everything on the guns it's all about
03:07:40.040 gun control and we need more gun control
03:07:42.479 like the gun is a tool there's more guns
03:07:45.880 in this country than there are human
03:07:47.720 beings okay I I made this I made this
03:07:49.880 argument out the debate the the idea
03:07:52.560 that you can gun regulate your way out
03:07:54.560 of this problem is ridiculous because
03:07:56.880 ridicul we have so many firearms in the
03:07:58.520 United States of America that even if I
03:08:00.000 bought into the gun control argument
03:08:01.720 you're never going to be able to get
03:08:04.640 sufficient guns off the streets so it's
03:08:06.840 ridiculous so we have we have to
03:08:08.720 actually go after some of the root
03:08:10.720 causes here it also ignores me like
03:08:12.760 Finland for example has a lot of guns
03:08:15.600 does not have nearly the same problem
03:08:17.520 with these Mass shooters that we do I'd
03:08:19.399 be interested to see what their their um
03:08:22.520 mental health drug usage rate is too did
03:08:25.399 you ever see Ted nent debate Pierce
03:08:27.840 Morgan on gun violence no I never did I
03:08:31.319 pretty good it's really good Ted smart
03:08:33.399 guy he's a very smart guy but Ted
03:08:35.479 actually knows the statistics so when
03:08:37.479 Pierce was bringing up all the mass
03:08:40.000 shootings and all the gun violence
03:08:41.920 shootings Ted said do you know what they
03:08:44.600 really are do you know how many of them
03:08:46.840 are suicide side do you know how many of
03:08:49.000 them are gang violence do you know how
03:08:51.160 many of them are cop shooting bad guys
03:08:53.640 do you know how many of them are
03:08:56.520 actually Mass Shooters yeah yeah I did
03:08:59.840 know that actually that Mo when we talk
03:09:01.200 about gun violence problem what we're
03:09:03.200 really talking about primarily is gang
03:09:05.560 violence yes right that's where that's
03:09:07.880 where a lot of the gun violence I think
03:09:09.479 a majority of the gun violence is coming
03:09:11.120 from which is not to say it's not a
03:09:12.760 problem but it's not the same problem
03:09:14.680 that obviously gathers most of the
03:09:15.960 headlines right and idea that just
03:09:18.200 getting guns out of people's hands you
03:09:19.760 got a bail we're good I'm I'm good if
03:09:21.399 you are the guy yeah the idea that
03:09:22.880 you're going to take guns away from
03:09:25.080 everyone you're going to solve the
03:09:26.279 problem it's like no you're you're still
03:09:28.080 going to have people that are out of
03:09:29.359 their mind and they want to commit
03:09:32.359 violence and they're going to find
03:09:33.520 another way to do it like we we've we've
03:09:36.040 had other ways that people have killed a
03:09:38.600 lot of people because they were sick
03:09:40.279 yeah because they're out of their mind
03:09:41.479 that's right and the fact that no one
03:09:43.399 wants to look at this connection between
03:09:45.640 psychiatric drugs and mass shootings is
03:09:48.880 kind of insane have you have you found
03:09:50.680 anything that shows like the data on
03:09:53.040 that's pretty wild I'm finding people
03:09:54.680 saying that there no link no proof
03:09:56.800 there's a paper that says so I'm trying
03:09:59.160 to find so that time is that's Central
03:10:01.040 Time right it's 12:19 right now we've
03:10:03.560 probably got like 15 20 more minutes cuz
03:10:05.200 I have to do this event with tulsy in
03:10:06.319 Pennsylvania so um when is this going to
03:10:09.160 air but oh sorry tomorrow tomorrow great
03:10:11.640 or today okay today tonight fantastic um
03:10:14.800 anyway so yeah what are you doing with
03:10:16.680 Tulsi uh we're doing veterans Town Hall
03:10:18.680 as a matter of fact at uh I think we're
03:10:20.840 doing Western PA but I need to check I
03:10:23.160 don't know where I'm going from day to
03:10:24.359 day but um yeah she obviously cares a
03:10:27.000 lot about veterans issues and you know
03:10:28.640 the most important veterans issue is
03:10:31.239 yeah the mental health thing really
03:10:32.279 matters but it's that we shouldn't be
03:10:33.680 sending them to stupid Wars well that
03:10:35.439 was one of the most insane things that
03:10:37.560 Hillary Clinton did when she tried to
03:10:38.960 say that she was a Russian
03:10:41.000 agent like that was so much [ __ ] man
03:10:43.640 I is so crazy this woman so czy overseas
03:10:49.279 twice she was a congresswoman for eight
03:10:51.600 years and decided to call her Russi
03:10:54.120 Russian agent Hillary Clinton by the way
03:10:55.319 who's not served in the military at all
03:10:57.399 and who's you know at least her husband
03:10:59.040 and her daughter haven't served in the
03:11:00.120 military at all so her immediate family
03:11:01.600 hasn't like give me a break on this she
03:11:03.520 was deployed in medical unions I mean
03:11:05.319 that's what literally where she got that
03:11:06.600 streak of gray in her hair no me Tulsi
03:11:08.840 is a like legitimate servant to the
03:11:11.760 United States of America and the
03:11:13.319 accusation that she's not comes from
03:11:15.000 people who want to send Americans to
03:11:17.600 Wars that have no connection to our
03:11:19.920 national interest I mean this is the
03:11:22.160 biggest difference I think
03:11:24.359 between K Harrison Donald Trump is
03:11:26.720 actually foreign policy and that there
03:11:28.680 are three issues man I I've learned this
03:11:30.600 in my own brief political career there
03:11:32.200 are three issues where you are not
03:11:34.120 allowed to challenge The Establishment
03:11:36.279 one is trade you you know you have to be
03:11:38.800 pro- free trade everything is good let
03:11:42.399 as many Chinese slave labor made
03:11:44.279 products into your country as possible
03:11:46.080 even if it destroys native indust
03:11:47.239 industries that is number one the most
03:11:49.560 important issue to our establishment the
03:11:51.000 number two most important issue is is
03:11:53.279 immigration and the number three most
03:11:55.200 important issue is foreign policy and
03:11:58.040 maybe actually foreign policy is the
03:11:59.520 biggest because if you criticize the
03:12:01.319 wars and you criticize American foreign
03:12:05.600 entanglements that is where people get
03:12:07.479 really far what is the root of that you
03:12:09.000 think I think some of financial right I
03:12:11.279 mean you know Liz sheney wants her board
03:12:13.319 seat at Ron and everywhere else that's
03:12:16.000 that's part of what's driving it of
03:12:17.239 course her dad was a major owner um or I
03:12:20.080 believe that he owned a pretty
03:12:21.239 significant stank in Halle Burton but I
03:12:23.359 actually think I don't want to overstate
03:12:25.160 that because I actually don't think
03:12:26.200 that's most of what's going on and I I
03:12:28.319 this is maybe a background view that I
03:12:30.359 have that I should interrogate a little
03:12:31.640 bit more but I I tend to think that
03:12:34.120 people aren't expressly financially
03:12:36.800 motivated I think they're much better at
03:12:38.800 rationalizing their financial motivation
03:12:40.840 as somehow good so I don't think Liz
03:12:42.920 Cheney to be fair even though I can't
03:12:45.040 stand her wakes up and says oh I want to
03:12:47.600 get rich so I'm going to support the
03:12:49.359 Ukraine war so that rathon can continue
03:12:51.560 making all these missiles I think what's
03:12:53.399 going on is they have convince
03:12:55.600 themselves that the post World War II
03:12:57.640 American
03:12:58.960 consensus this entire idea that we're
03:13:01.319 going to remake the entire world in
03:13:03.200 America's image they think that that is
03:13:05.680 the most important the most valuable
03:13:07.600 project and they don't care they're
03:13:09.960 going to they're going to do it as much
03:13:11.239 as they can even though I think it's run
03:13:13.399 its course I think we should have
03:13:14.800 learned in Iraq we can't turn everybody
03:13:16.439 into the United States States of America
03:13:17.760 nor should we want to but these guys
03:13:19.840 can't quite give up on it it's just a
03:13:22.000 powerful psychological motivation if you
03:13:23.880 go back to when the Soviet Union fell
03:13:26.399 right when the Berlin Wall fell in the
03:13:28.120 late 80s early
03:13:29.520 90s there was this sense among American
03:13:32.399 leaders right Bill Clinton takes over in
03:13:35.000 1992 that we had reached what was called
03:13:38.200 at the time the end of history that
03:13:40.279 Western liberal democracy was going to
03:13:42.479 Triumph everybody was going to be like
03:13:44.359 us there was going to be no more ethnic
03:13:46.000 conflict no more Rel conflict no more
03:13:48.160 regional conflict and I think these guys
03:13:50.160 bought the idea so profoundly that they
03:13:54.680 can't really wake up and recognize that
03:13:57.960 for the past 40 years we've tried their
03:13:59.760 theories and their theories haven't
03:14:01.560 worked there's also the craziest thing
03:14:04.200 that happened to me during this campaign
03:14:07.080 was when Dick Cheney and dors KLA Harris
03:14:09.439 and the left went crazy yay dick ch's on
03:14:11.640 our side like the craziest thing I know
03:14:14.800 the guy look at what they said about
03:14:17.279 Donald Trump how much do you hate Donald
03:14:18.880 Trump that you're willing to choose Dick
03:14:20.960 Cheney over him and that Dick Cheney is
03:14:23.000 all of a sudden a good guy the the
03:14:24.680 engineer behind the Iraq war is
03:14:26.279 responsible for how many people dead um
03:14:29.000 you know hundreds of thousands maybe
03:14:30.319 millions of Arabs certainly thousands of
03:14:32.439 Americans the biggest world historical
03:14:36.200 catastrophe I think in the history of
03:14:38.080 the United States of America was the
03:14:39.239 Iraq War because unlike other mistakes
03:14:41.359 that we've made it was truly unforced
03:14:44.120 there was no reason in hindsight to do
03:14:46.239 it there was nothing that we got out of
03:14:48.319 it we lost I mean so many innocent
03:14:51.680 people we spent trillions of dollars we
03:14:54.760 I think destroyed the social cohesion
03:14:57.720 that we had gotten after 911 because
03:14:59.560 remember like after 9/11 everybody was
03:15:01.600 an American we were all on the same team
03:15:03.120 democrat or republican we destroyed that
03:15:05.720 and we created in Iraq effectively a
03:15:07.760 proxy of Iran which it's telling now
03:15:10.120 that 20 years later the biggest foreign
03:15:13.399 policy threat that we face in the Middle
03:15:14.840 East is Iran and we created a massive
03:15:18.640 Ally of the Iranians and the Iraqis and
03:15:21.080 none of the people who actually presided
03:15:24.840 over that disaster saying oh maybe we
03:15:26.560 really really screwed up and maybe we
03:15:28.479 should reevaluate some of our
03:15:30.840 assumptions there's only a few days left
03:15:34.359 um how much of a chance do you think
03:15:37.760 Trump has to win this um are you
03:15:41.520 confident or is it close I'm confident I
03:15:44.520 I'm it is close but I am confident
03:15:46.479 because it's close but it's close in a
03:15:48.199 way that favors us right the undecided
03:15:49.840 voters tend to be voters who are more
03:15:52.080 aligned with us I think the early voting
03:15:54.520 data looks really good I think that you
03:15:57.520 know people just fundamentally don't
03:15:58.840 want to do more of the same and kamla
03:16:00.600 Harris is more of the same I think some
03:16:02.080 of our arguments that KLA Harris is the
03:16:04.120 voter is the candidate of censorship is
03:16:06.800 starting to really break through but you
03:16:08.960 know to your listeners if you agree with
03:16:10.840 what I've said here get out there and
03:16:12.640 vote because like there is something to
03:16:15.160 be said for me and Donald Trump actually
03:16:18.319 sat and had a conversation and you know
03:16:20.319 hopefully I didn't make a complete fool
03:16:21.479 of myself but they just don't do that
03:16:24.120 right like why why would we make a
03:16:25.760 person who's terrified of talking about
03:16:27.960 what she wants to do and what she
03:16:29.120 believes why would we make her president
03:16:30.800 of the United States the only way to to
03:16:32.359 to make that not happen is to vote for
03:16:34.600 me and Trump uh on or before November
03:16:37.080 the 5th so it's it's very important um I
03:16:41.000 feel good about it but I don't feel
03:16:42.120 great about it because there are a lot
03:16:44.439 of ways in which Democrats are going to
03:16:46.239 try to motivate their base down the
03:16:47.640 stretch there are a lot of ways in which
03:16:49.840 yeah I mean I I I wouldn't put it past
03:16:51.279 them maybe they do try to cheat I don't
03:16:52.840 know exactly what it looks like in five
03:16:54.479 or six days but I know that the best
03:16:57.520 thing that we can do to prevent that
03:16:58.720 from happening is to get out there make
03:17:00.160 our voices heard all right thanks man
03:17:02.760 thank you very much thanks for being
03:17:03.800 here appreciate it good see you too all
03:17:05.760 right bye everybody
