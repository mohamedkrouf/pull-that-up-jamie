# https://www.youtube.com/watch/efs3QRr8LWw

00:00:11.150 and okay you're very professional you
00:00:16.039 know people are like how do you live and
00:00:19.400 things like that they're taking money
00:00:21.079 from the Russians and of course the
00:00:22.759 answer's no but I I do this for a living
00:00:25.520 like I speak I don't have a youtube
00:00:27.560 channel that where it's you know I'm Joe
00:00:29.539 Rogan but I give speeches at
00:00:31.670 universities and things like that I do a
00:00:33.350 lot of interviews and so we're recording
00:00:35.360 now and set up ooh is it possible that
00:00:37.910 you could do a YouTube channel
00:00:39.739 would that work yeah like I I mean if
00:00:45.860 you introduced me so like I get
00:00:47.239 followers yeah we could do that too I'm
00:00:49.190 all-in with that that could absolutely
00:00:51.559 happen do you want to do that is it
00:00:53.239 something you want to do no I mean this
00:00:55.549 is a big question so I I came on because
00:00:58.729 I just written a book called permanent
00:01:01.489 record which is the the story of my life
00:01:04.610 because that's what publishers make you
00:01:06.530 do and when you're writing your first
00:01:08.060 book but it's more than that because I
00:01:11.330 didn't just want to talk about me it's
00:01:12.890 actually about the changing of
00:01:13.820 Technology and the changing of
00:01:15.680 government in this sort of post 9/11 era
00:01:18.190 which you know our generation just sort
00:01:20.780 of happened to be growing up during and
00:01:24.080 I was at the CIA and the NSA and all
00:01:25.700 this stuff but the day that the book
00:01:27.200 came out the government hit me with a
00:01:29.360 lawsuit and they hit the publisher of
00:01:31.550 the books with a with a lawsuit because
00:01:35.690 they don't want to see books like this
00:01:37.040 get written they especially don't want
00:01:39.050 to see books like this get read and so
00:01:42.470 the big thing was you know we didn't
00:01:44.180 know where this was going we didn't know
00:01:45.380 what was gonna happen and my publisher
00:01:47.360 of course wanted me very badly to let
00:01:50.540 people know this book existed in case
00:01:53.150 the government leaned hard and harder
00:01:54.470 harder we didn't know where where that's
00:01:56.240 going
00:01:56.600 I mean the government is still pursuing
00:01:59.390 that case quite strongly they're more
00:02:02.240 focused on though the financial
00:02:03.490 censorship side of it basically taking
00:02:06.110 any money that I made from it kind of is
00:02:08.209 a warning to the others and getting a
00:02:11.150 legal judgment against the publishers
00:02:13.250 saying you know you can't pay this guy
00:02:14.629 that kind of thing more so than taking
00:02:17.120 the book off the shelves but that's not
00:02:18.590 because they're okay with the book being
00:02:21.499 on the shelves it's because thankfully
00:02:22.760 we've got the first of
00:02:24.240 and so they can't and that's a very rare
00:02:26.970 and good thing but anyway in the context
00:02:30.720 of that they were like well what about
00:02:34.050 Joe Rogan and you know I I had heard
00:02:36.720 about you at this point but you know the
00:02:40.170 only thing that I had really seen that I
00:02:41.910 really understood had familiarity with
00:02:44.940 was like you talking to Bernie Sanders
00:02:46.110 which by the way I very much appreciated
00:02:48.720 hearing them because a lot of people
00:02:50.820 don't give the guy time to talk yeah to
00:02:53.430 hear him in those sound bites you don't
00:02:55.350 really get an understanding of who he
00:02:56.640 actually is right and this is the other
00:02:59.100 thing like they're like well you know
00:03:00.360 you can go on all these you know major
00:03:03.180 Network shows and I I did a couple of
00:03:05.400 them I did like a morning show I did
00:03:08.070 Brian Williams but broadly the media the
00:03:12.720 the the sort of more corporatized media
00:03:14.760 as we might say is exactly what you just
00:03:17.910 described right they they want you to be
00:03:19.800 able to answer in like 8 15 seconds or
00:03:21.840 less and when we're talking about big
00:03:25.200 massive shifts in society we're talking
00:03:27.030 about power we're talking about
00:03:29.720 technology and how it controls and
00:03:31.740 influences us in the future
00:03:34.110 you you can't have a meaningful
00:03:35.970 conversation with them those constraints
00:03:37.730 and so it said these guys all want to
00:03:39.900 say repeat these long discredited sort
00:03:42.990 of criticisms and you know I'm sure
00:03:44.280 you'll you'll you'll ask the same thing
00:03:45.720 and that's ok they're there for
00:03:47.670 questions but it's like we can't have
00:03:50.280 the conversation if we can't have this
00:03:51.900 space to think right breathe and have
00:03:54.510 this sort of discussion so anyway they
00:03:56.970 mentioned you
00:03:57.810 and I was like Joe Rogan Joe Rogan Joe
00:03:59.790 Rogan where do I know this name from
00:04:01.520 before Bernie Sanders and I look back
00:04:06.240 through my Twitter mentions and the
00:04:09.000 funny thing is your fans have been
00:04:11.180 harassing me to death for like the last
00:04:15.390 year's wonderful people wonderful people
00:04:17.180 but like go on Joe Rogan go on Joe Rogan
00:04:19.769 and I remember like after I had just
00:04:22.590 made a Twitter account Neil deGrasse
00:04:24.180 Tyson actually I helped me get on
00:04:25.890 Twitter gave me that little initial
00:04:28.830 boost and they said Joe Rogan and so I
00:04:32.460 they like linked you and you know I I
00:04:34.410 mouse over your name cuz I use a desktop
00:04:36.950 for this because security reasons and it
00:04:39.650 pops up and I get your avatar man and
00:04:41.900 like I have to say your logo it's the
00:04:45.920 worst thing in the world for people who
00:04:47.900 are like trying to be like politically
00:04:49.700 serious and you know they're worried
00:04:51.020 about the National Security Adviser
00:04:52.220 condemning because like this bald guy
00:04:54.290 with this maniacal grin and like the
00:04:56.480 third eye on his forehead and I'm like
00:04:58.160 oh man that's show but it's actually
00:05:02.750 like you watch you know wouldn't when
00:05:05.060 you watch what you do is it's great
00:05:06.320 stuff man it's great but that first
00:05:07.880 impression like I this almost didn't
00:05:12.110 happen but everybody who has talked to
00:05:15.080 you you know everybody who watches your
00:05:17.240 show I think they get a very different
00:05:18.860 impression and then how you're paying it
00:05:20.090 and for me it's a wonderful thing
00:05:21.860 because nobody understands that better
00:05:23.240 than I do right like the government ran
00:05:24.770 a smear campaign against me endlessly
00:05:27.610 for six months when I came forward in
00:05:30.440 June of 2013 I know we got way off topic
00:05:32.180 here oh I'll get back to it fine
00:05:34.250 there's no such thing as off topic we
00:05:36.860 could do okay talk about whatever great
00:05:39.770 great okay so for those people first off
00:05:42.380 who have no idea who the hell I am
00:05:45.190 I'm the guy who was behind the
00:05:48.200 revelations of global mass surveillance
00:05:49.910 in 2013 I worked for the CIA I worked
00:05:53.630 for the NSA as a contractor at the NS a
00:05:56.150 staff officer the CIA I was undercover
00:05:58.670 working at embassies but and I talked
00:06:02.480 about the difference between this and a
00:06:03.740 book and contractor and government
00:06:05.720 official and how it's all sort of lost
00:06:07.610 its meaning but I saw something wrong
00:06:10.730 and I saw basically the government was
00:06:12.500 violating the law and what I believe to
00:06:15.530 be the Constitution of the United States
00:06:17.030 and more broadly human rights for
00:06:19.190 everyone in the United States and around
00:06:20.510 the world there were domestic
00:06:21.560 surveillance programs there were mass
00:06:22.910 surveillance programs that worked
00:06:24.410 internationally basically everything
00:06:27.080 that they could monitor led they were
00:06:28.970 monitoring and this is actually like
00:06:32.030 people go war isn't that obvious isn't
00:06:33.650 that what they're supposed to do and
00:06:34.760 this is weird but the answer actually is
00:06:36.740 no under the framework of our
00:06:39.380 Constitution the government is only
00:06:40.610 supposed to be monitoring people that it
00:06:42.890 has a individualized particularized
00:06:45.520 suspicion of wrongdoing for right this
00:06:48.920 is we think about this in the investing
00:06:50.510 if means right like all those TV shows
00:06:52.760 where they're like go and get a warrant
00:06:54.220 the reason they have to do that like we
00:06:56.600 fought a revolution over this you know a
00:07:00.860 couple hundred years back is the idea
00:07:03.950 that when we had you know Kings when we
00:07:06.080 had governments of absolute power they
00:07:08.210 could simply go in your home and go you
00:07:10.250 know is this guy pot smoker get his
00:07:11.840 diary you know whatever it is and just
00:07:13.880 like if you find evidence of a crime you
00:07:15.800 March them off to prison and it's all
00:07:17.060 good you found evidence they're criminal
00:07:19.220 or you didn't find evidence well no harm
00:07:20.810 no foul
00:07:21.530 you're just doing what government does
00:07:25.090 we were trying to build a better system
00:07:28.100 where when yes the government has
00:07:30.190 extraordinary capabilities but it only
00:07:32.990 uses them whether they're necessary
00:07:35.030 right where they're proportionate to the
00:07:38.900 threat that is presented by this person
00:07:40.640 you know like we shouldn't be afraid of
00:07:42.620 the person who's got like a baggie of
00:07:44.030 weed in their dresser or something like
00:07:47.240 that that is not a threat to national
00:07:48.500 security that's not a threat to public
00:07:49.970 safety but what happened in the wake of
00:07:54.350 9/11 was a whole bunch of government
00:07:56.300 officials got together behind closed
00:07:58.070 doors and this was actually led
00:07:59.780 interestingly enough by the Vice
00:08:01.670 President of the United States Cheney
00:08:03.340 everybody remembers that name or
00:08:05.420 hopefully I can look that name up Dick
00:08:09.050 Cheney and his personal attorney sort of
00:08:12.860 the the Giuliani of Dick Cheney a guy
00:08:17.150 named David Addington
00:08:18.200 and this lawyer David Addington wrote a
00:08:21.860 secret legal interpretation but no one
00:08:25.430 else was allowed to see it was kept in
00:08:27.620 the vice president's safe at the White
00:08:28.940 House they weren't giving this even when
00:08:31.640 they told people and it was just a
00:08:33.500 couple people in Congress Nancy Pelosi
00:08:37.130 was one of them on a couple of these
00:08:38.299 other folks when they talked to the
00:08:41.840 heads of the agency the NSA and the CIA
00:08:44.090 and the FBI and all this stuff they told
00:08:47.270 them the White House in the office of
00:08:49.040 legal counsel and you know this this the
00:08:51.320 president's attorneys all of these guys
00:08:53.330 had decided this would be legal to do
00:08:56.500 but we can't tell you why we can't show
00:09:00.080 you the legal authorization where you
00:09:01.670 just got to take our word for it
00:09:03.350 and so they
00:09:04.250 did this and this became a mass
00:09:05.480 surveillance program called stellar wind
00:09:07.340 which they said was supposed to monitor
00:09:09.530 the phone calls in Internet
00:09:11.600 communications emails and things like
00:09:14.090 that of everybody in the United States
00:09:15.380 and around the world who they could get
00:09:16.940 access to for links al Qaeda because if
00:09:20.720 you remember in the wake of the
00:09:23.000 September 11th attacks they were singing
00:09:27.640 we thought there could be sleeper cells
00:09:30.500 about Qaeda that we've just you know
00:09:32.150 peppered all throughout the country they
00:09:33.500 were gonna spring up at any moment of
00:09:34.670 course like weapons of mass destruction
00:09:36.500 it just didn't exist it was all the
00:09:38.150 power grab
00:09:39.650 but on that basis they started doing
00:09:42.260 this in secret and it was completely
00:09:43.850 unconstitutional was completely illegal
00:09:45.500 even under the very loose requirements
00:09:47.570 of the Patriot Act but they did it for
00:09:50.900 so long that they got comfortable with
00:09:54.050 it and they thought this is it you know
00:09:55.160 this is a really powerful capability
00:09:56.960 what have we started using this for
00:09:58.250 stuff that was other than terrorism
00:10:00.080 because it wasn't finding any terrorists
00:10:02.180 because there weren't any terrorists in
00:10:04.910 this context that we're looking for them
00:10:06.800 and the ones who we're there were
00:10:09.140 terrorists the program wasn't affected
00:10:10.700 because these were guys in Pakistan that
00:10:12.110 weren't using you know email and phone
00:10:14.870 calls they were getting on you know
00:10:16.670 moped with their cousin who was a
00:10:18.170 courier who was bringing a letter to his
00:10:20.420 guy you know who runs the the food stand
00:10:23.000 or whatever but bit by bit over time
00:10:27.290 this grew and grew and grew and there
00:10:28.820 were scandals and if you want to drill
00:10:30.290 down in these later all going to him but
00:10:31.820 what happened was step by step by step
00:10:36.680 our constitutional rights were changed
00:10:39.339 and we weren't allowed to know it we
00:10:42.440 were never granted a vote on it and even
00:10:44.570 the many members of Congress right 535
00:10:47.150 in the United States they were
00:10:49.550 prohibited from knowing this and instead
00:10:53.089 they told only a few select people yeah
00:10:56.089 in the original case there were only
00:10:57.200 eight members of Congress called the
00:10:59.060 gang of eight who knew about this then
00:11:02.360 there were the people on the
00:11:04.220 intelligence committees both in the
00:11:06.680 Senate in the house who were told about
00:11:08.030 this but they were only told partially
00:11:10.400 about it they weren't told the full
00:11:11.420 scope of it and now that they had been
00:11:13.820 told about it because they had security
00:11:15.530 clearances and
00:11:16.279 like that they weren't allowed to tell
00:11:17.360 anybody else even if they objected to it
00:11:19.639 and we had one Senator Ron Wyden I mean
00:11:23.360 another one I believe Tom Udall was
00:11:24.680 named of him who did object to this and
00:11:26.569 who wanted something to happen but
00:11:28.040 because they couldn't tell anybody that
00:11:29.569 was happening they were sort of doing
00:11:30.889 these weird lassie barks to the press
00:11:33.949 where they were like we have grave
00:11:35.149 concerns about the way these programs
00:11:36.649 are being carried out but nobody knew
00:11:38.809 what they were talking about and so
00:11:40.819 journalists were like you know they've
00:11:42.259 got concerns what is that Lassie what
00:11:43.730 are you trying to say timmy's them well
00:11:44.930 but they were getting it wrong they
00:11:46.550 couldn't tell what was happening so what
00:11:48.139 had happened was that we the American
00:11:50.990 people had sort of lost our seat at the
00:11:53.809 table of government we were no longer
00:11:55.999 partner to government we had simply
00:11:57.680 become subject to government and I think
00:11:59.029 everybody who's in the world today who
00:12:03.110 is aware of what's going on whether it's
00:12:05.149 under this administration last
00:12:07.160 administration the one before that right
00:12:09.110 they have seen a constant kind of shift
00:12:13.610 where we have we the public have less
00:12:17.149 say and less influence over the policy
00:12:19.430 of government with each passing year
00:12:22.250 there's kind of a new class that's being
00:12:25.129 created a government class and then the
00:12:27.379 public civil class that are held to
00:12:30.259 different standards of behavior and when
00:12:31.879 we start talking about leaking and
00:12:32.990 whistleblowing this becomes even more
00:12:34.699 clear and so what I did was I wanted to
00:12:38.629 clarify that kind of lassie bark right I
00:12:40.939 just wanted everybody to know what was
00:12:43.040 going on I didn't want to say the
00:12:46.279 government can't do this I didn't want
00:12:48.410 to say this is how you guys have to live
00:12:50.329 because that's not for me to say now but
00:12:52.639 I do believe that everybody in the
00:12:54.050 United States and more broadly people in
00:12:55.879 the world who are having their rights
00:12:56.809 violated by a government should have at
00:12:59.720 least an understanding of how that is
00:13:01.610 happening what the authorities sort of
00:13:04.040 the policies and programs that are
00:13:05.389 enabling that or so that they can
00:13:08.329 protest them so that they can cast a
00:13:10.879 vote about them so that they can't say
00:13:12.800 you know what you guys say this is okay
00:13:14.899 but I disagreed that this is not okay I
00:13:17.480 object and I want things to change and
00:13:19.670 so I gathered evidence of what I believe
00:13:21.379 to be a criminal or unconstitutional
00:13:24.019 activity on the part of government and I
00:13:26.569 gave this to journalists right
00:13:29.330 now I gave this to journalists under a
00:13:32.120 very strict condition here which was
00:13:33.649 that they publish no story in this
00:13:36.080 archive of information simply because it
00:13:38.540 was interesting right no clickbait not
00:13:40.279 anything just because they thought it
00:13:42.709 would make news that we get them awards
00:13:44.290 they would only publish stories that
00:13:46.760 they were willing to make an
00:13:47.620 institutional judgment and stand behind
00:13:49.600 and this was three different newspapers
00:13:52.959 that it was in the public interest to
00:13:55.970 know and so then beyond that there was
00:14:00.470 additional is because if you could see
00:14:02.089 sort of what I was doing here what had
00:14:03.890 happened what had led us into this
00:14:05.709 pitfall was that the system of checks
00:14:12.320 and balances that's supposed to
00:14:14.000 self-regulate our government had failed
00:14:15.890 the courts had abdicated their role in
00:14:19.160 policing the executive in the Congress
00:14:20.959 because terrorism was such a hot
00:14:24.050 argument at the time they were worried
00:14:25.940 about being criticized and blamed if
00:14:27.829 something went wrong an attack did go
00:14:29.240 through and they didn't have access to
00:14:31.459 the information that the programs were
00:14:33.230 ineffective so they were just taking the
00:14:34.700 government's word for it they didn't
00:14:36.320 want to wait in Congress most of them
00:14:39.230 didn't even know right and the ones who
00:14:42.170 did know it was the same thing they were
00:14:44.420 getting their pockets stuffed with money
00:14:46.370 by the defense contractors that were
00:14:48.589 getting rich for building these systems
00:14:50.270 that were violating the rights of each
00:14:51.800 of us so they benefited by just saying
00:14:54.470 nothing and then the executive
00:14:55.550 themselves whether we're talking about
00:14:57.709 Bush right whether we're talking about
00:14:59.240 Obama or whether we're talking about
00:15:00.560 Trump now all these guys were okay with
00:15:03.529 a constantly growing surveillance state
00:15:05.300 because they're the ones whose hands
00:15:07.220 were on the lever at the time they got
00:15:09.110 to aim it they got to use it if you had
00:15:11.899 a little search box in front of you they
00:15:14.029 would give you the email history and you
00:15:16.279 know of everybody in the United States
00:15:17.779 anybody you want if you could pull up
00:15:19.190 their text messages anybody you want if
00:15:21.320 you could see anything they've ever
00:15:22.370 typed into that Google search box right
00:15:24.260 Joe what is the worst thing you've ever
00:15:26.750 typed into that search box that lasts
00:15:29.750 forever
00:15:30.290 right and they have a record of that
00:15:32.000 they can get that from Google and so
00:15:34.970 this was this was the whole thing how do
00:15:37.339 we correct for that so when you have
00:15:40.970 somebody
00:15:42.339 who wants to inform the public of
00:15:43.779 something and we'll get into the proper
00:15:45.519 channels arguments later but you can't
00:15:49.689 go through the institution to get these
00:15:51.639 corrected because the institution knows
00:15:53.889 it's wrong and is doing it anyway right
00:15:56.139 that's the whole origin of the program
00:15:58.600 is they want to do something that
00:16:00.339 they're not allowed to do what do you do
00:16:03.519 right and so I didn't want to say I'm
00:16:05.499 the president of Secrets I didn't want
00:16:06.910 to just put this stuff on the internet
00:16:07.870 and I could have on the technologist
00:16:09.699 right I worked with the journalists and
00:16:12.939 then that to create an adversarial step
00:16:15.579 right someone who would argue against
00:16:18.040 what I believed and hopefully what the
00:16:20.110 journalists believe once they consulted
00:16:22.059 the documents and basically
00:16:23.889 authenticated them can we get the
00:16:28.480 government to play that role right and
00:16:32.259 so before the journalists published any
00:16:34.300 story this is a controversial thing
00:16:36.160 people still criticize me for this
00:16:37.809 actually they say I was too
00:16:38.769 accommodating government think they
00:16:40.029 could be right is that the journalist
00:16:43.870 would go to the government and give them
00:16:45.160 warning say we're about to run this
00:16:46.899 story about this secret program that
00:16:48.999 says you did X Y & Z bad thing one is
00:16:52.990 that right and the government always go
00:16:54.850 over no comment right - is this gonna
00:16:57.759 cause harm is anybody gonna get hurt is
00:16:59.949 this program effective is there
00:17:01.389 something we don't understand right as
00:17:03.459 if something Snowden doesn't understand
00:17:05.648 it is this guy just not get it right are
00:17:07.750 these documents fake whatever you want
00:17:09.640 say we shouldn't run this story in every
00:17:13.270 case I'm aware of that process was
00:17:14.770 followed and that's why right it was
00:17:16.929 because there's a lot of people out
00:17:17.799 there who don't like me who criticize me
00:17:19.659 who go this was unsafe this caused harm
00:17:21.609 to people or whatever we're in 2019
00:17:24.909 now I came forward and these stories
00:17:28.600 weren't the Pulitzer Prize for public
00:17:30.010 service journalism starting way back in
00:17:32.529 June of 2013 we've had six years to show
00:17:38.440 bodies we've had six years to show harm
00:17:40.690 and you know as well as I do the
00:17:43.000 government's happy to leak things when
00:17:44.320 it's in in their interest nobody has
00:17:47.380 been hurt as a result of these
00:17:48.640 disclosures because everyone who was
00:17:50.770 involved in them was so careful we
00:17:53.110 wanted to maximize
00:17:54.220 the public benefit while mitigating the
00:17:56.320 potential risks and I think we did a
00:17:59.380 pretty good job but just to get back to
00:18:01.030 the the main thing and the original
00:18:03.460 thing that got us off on that trail
00:18:06.280 when I came forward in June of 2013 and
00:18:09.070 I gave one interview to the people who
00:18:10.750 were in the room with the documents
00:18:14.140 Laura Poitras Glenn Greenwald you and
00:18:16.750 McCaskill and I said who I was I said
00:18:19.630 why I was doing this I said what this
00:18:20.980 was about why it matters and that we
00:18:23.650 were constructing a system of turnkey
00:18:25.030 tyranny and even if you trust that to
00:18:27.280 Obama you never know whose hand is gonna
00:18:28.990 be on that key next and all I have to do
00:18:31.000 is turn it and there's nothing we can do
00:18:32.860 to stop it the only thing that's
00:18:35.049 restraining these programs really is is
00:18:36.820 policy more so than the law and the
00:18:39.669 President and anytime can sign a napkin
00:18:41.350 and those policies change well after
00:18:45.970 that I went six months without giving
00:18:48.400 any interviews because I didn't want
00:18:50.590 people to talk about me and I wanted
00:18:51.789 them to talk about what actually
00:18:53.110 mattered and the government of course
00:18:54.250 was trying very hard to change the
00:18:55.870 conversation as they always do to be
00:18:58.419 about who is this guy what have they
00:18:59.950 done right what's wrong with them what
00:19:01.480 are their problems who is this this
00:19:02.830 loony guy so they can controversial eyes
00:19:05.740 the source of a story rather than having
00:19:08.650 to confront that the story itself and
00:19:12.850 that's why I said it's I I really kind
00:19:15.429 of appreciate your your take on the
00:19:21.880 media and everything like that because
00:19:24.240 when you don't tell your story you know
00:19:26.679 other people will tell it for you
00:19:28.419 they'll say so many things about you and
00:19:30.159 they'll have these misimpressions like I
00:19:32.110 did because if something is stupid as
00:19:33.730 the avatar that you were using on
00:19:35.500 Twitter right well I think it's a
00:19:37.690 certain kind of show with a certain kind
00:19:39.190 of guy and it's this crazy stuff but
00:19:41.380 when I actually listen to you when I
00:19:43.720 actually look at the facts right and
00:19:46.090 when I hear you just speak I go actually
00:19:49.120 this is a thoughtful guy actually this
00:19:51.250 is somebody who does care who does want
00:19:52.990 to look at these things deeply and
00:19:54.850 appearances and our first impressions
00:19:56.950 can be very misleading I work hard on
00:20:00.100 that I try to mislead people it's good
00:20:03.210 works to my advantage do a good job man
00:20:05.649 thank you
00:20:07.050 I want to bring it back to when you
00:20:08.760 first started with the NSA you started
00:20:11.430 as a contractor right what was your
00:20:14.190 initial impression and when did you know
00:20:16.620 that things were really squirrely with
00:20:20.280 the programs that sort of thing so I'm
00:20:23.130 not saying this to put put you on the
00:20:24.870 spot I know you've been a busy guy I
00:20:26.160 don't know you hadn't done I think shows
00:20:30.000 recently you come back from break right
00:20:31.880 but have you read the book because it'll
00:20:34.830 just help me your boyfriend if you
00:20:36.690 haven't got a chance
00:20:37.620 you know no I have not read your book or
00:20:39.450 got a copy of it okay well I will send
00:20:42.120 you a signed copy brother beautiful I
00:20:44.010 don't hope you'll read it and I hope you
00:20:45.330 enjoy it but alright so I had a really
00:20:50.100 weird history in the intelligence
00:20:53.190 community I grew up in a federal family
00:20:56.600 in the shadow of Fort Meade right all
00:20:59.340 these little suburban communities in
00:21:00.930 Maryland where basically the entire
00:21:02.880 industry of the state is the federal
00:21:05.040 government of all these different
00:21:06.450 agencies and then all the subcontractors
00:21:08.580 all the defense industries that serve
00:21:10.860 that government and really are kind of
00:21:12.780 our war making a machine are our system
00:21:14.940 of control for the country and the world
00:21:17.940 broadly all that stuff spreads and you
00:21:21.840 know a couple hundred mile radius out of
00:21:23.670 DC my mother worked for the district
00:21:28.860 courts rather than federal courts and
00:21:31.920 it's kind of funny because she still
00:21:33.900 works there and those are the courts
00:21:35.130 that are trying to throw me in jail for
00:21:36.300 the rest of my life now my father worked
00:21:39.090 for the Coast Guard retired after 30
00:21:41.490 years my grandfather was an admiral and
00:21:43.200 then he worked for the FBI as far back
00:21:47.730 as it goes my my family my whole line of
00:21:51.270 family even generations back was working
00:21:54.750 for the government um so it was pretty
00:21:57.360 ordinary pretty expected for me to go
00:22:00.630 into the same kind of work now I started
00:22:03.270 and I wasn't super successful in school
00:22:07.490 because it I felt and you know this is
00:22:13.110 the most arrogant thing in the world
00:22:14.130 than anybody says
00:22:19.130 that I had more to learn from computers
00:22:23.280 than I did from you know biology class
00:22:27.140 and so I spent more and more time
00:22:29.040 focusing on technology then I got mono
00:22:30.840 and I dropped out of high school and now
00:22:35.160 it's like alright how do I make this up
00:22:38.490 I drop out of high school but I'm
00:22:41.370 actually going to Community College
00:22:42.660 right they called it concurrent
00:22:44.820 enrollment where I'm not taking any
00:22:45.930 classes at high school I'm going to
00:22:48.180 Community College instead and I'm not
00:22:51.510 doing that great they're either like
00:22:53.250 it's fine
00:22:54.300 you know I'm enjoying it but you know
00:22:56.430 school is school I I want I can't wait
00:22:59.670 to be grown you're aboard um and I think
00:23:04.680 a lot of people have felt that but I ran
00:23:08.520 into somebody at the Community College
00:23:10.110 who ran their own home-based business
00:23:11.690 doing web design and they could see I
00:23:14.580 was kind of technical and they went hey
00:23:16.620 do you want to work for me and I was
00:23:17.970 like the woman that sounds great and so
00:23:20.940 I started doing web design really really
00:23:22.920 early on this is like gosh I don't know
00:23:25.830 probably a 1998 vintage during the big
00:23:31.290 boom and then the collapse that followed
00:23:33.330 and the funny thing is she worked she
00:23:36.800 was married to an NSA analyst a linguist
00:23:41.010 right and so she lived on Fort Meade and
00:23:44.610 she ran her business out of their home
00:23:48.270 on Fort Meade that's right up the street
00:23:50.400 from the NSA so before I'm even working
00:23:52.830 there I'm driving past this building all
00:23:55.890 of the time and trying to figure out you
00:23:58.770 know what the next step is gonna be and
00:24:00.420 I enjoy this it's it's a good thing for
00:24:02.610 me and it like it works well and I start
00:24:05.570 getting trained and certified all these
00:24:08.190 little industry stamps you've got to get
00:24:10.080 as a technologist to say oh you know
00:24:11.850 this program or whatever and just start
00:24:14.100 climbing the ladder but then 9/11
00:24:17.310 happens and I'm on Fort Meade when 9/11
00:24:21.870 happens I'm just going into work and I
00:24:23.430 tell this in the book in some detail and
00:24:27.780 I think it's very much worth reading
00:24:30.030 four people don't know this because this
00:24:31.590 forgotten history but how old were you
00:24:33.300 at this money uh uh OSH I was I was born
00:24:37.230 at 83 so I was probably 18 years old and
00:24:44.870 yeah yeah I just turned 18 a couple
00:24:48.540 months before and what people forget is
00:24:56.090 who knew what was going on before
00:24:58.050 anybody else Wow on September 11th the
00:25:01.710 intelligence community right and what
00:25:05.880 did they do right did they give out a
00:25:08.610 public warning did they tell you guys to
00:25:10.230 evacuate did they say do this adder
00:25:11.640 doesn't know no not for everybody not
00:25:15.390 for a long time but at the NSA then
00:25:22.350 director Michael Hayden he was a general
00:25:25.500 he later became a director of the CIA
00:25:28.160 ordered the entire campus evacuated of
00:25:32.030 thousands tens of thousands of people
00:25:34.220 actually just said go home right
00:25:37.440 the CIA did the same thing they were
00:25:39.720 running on skeleton crews at the moment
00:25:43.080 the country needed them more than they
00:25:45.150 ever had right and I get a call well not
00:25:52.200 hear a call that's from my boss's wife
00:25:56.030 her husband to her he's calling from the
00:25:59.310 NSA he's saying hey you know I think
00:26:00.810 edge leave for the day because I'm the
00:26:02.700 only employee of this business besides
00:26:04.110 her because I think they're gonna close
00:26:06.390 the base down and I'm like this is crazy
00:26:07.800 they've never closed us down we don't
00:26:09.630 know what's happening then we start
00:26:10.590 checking the news which is through
00:26:13.380 websites right because we're we're doing
00:26:15.360 all this stuff and suddenly it's the big
00:26:17.280 story everywhere and you know nobody
00:26:20.370 understands how big it is yet most of us
00:26:23.970 are like oh it's gonna mess with our
00:26:25.320 workday oh it's gonna mess with our
00:26:26.580 commute but when I'm leaving I hear car
00:26:31.050 horns all over the base it's the
00:26:32.490 craziest thing because this is a
00:26:33.570 military base right it's right outside
00:26:34.830 the NSA and I entered just this absolute
00:26:37.410 state of pandemonium as I go past k9
00:26:39.840 road which is the road that travels
00:26:41.550 right and Pat it
00:26:42.580 in front of the NSA's headquarters and
00:26:46.510 it's just a parking lot as far as you
00:26:49.300 can see they have military police out
00:26:51.940 under the stoplights directing traffic
00:26:55.080 because this is this mass evacuation and
00:26:57.340 I still have no idea what's happening
00:26:58.960 like the the story is still developing
00:27:02.580 but I will never forget that image why
00:27:11.710 did these people have so much power and
00:27:13.480 so much money and so much authority that
00:27:16.030 if at the moments we need them the most
00:27:18.400 there are the first ones in the country
00:27:20.800 that are leaving their buildings and you
00:27:24.730 know later on they said and this is uh
00:27:28.360 covered in a book I believe I think it's
00:27:33.400 James Bamford who interviewed that
00:27:36.970 director of NSA who gave that order
00:27:38.730 about what was happening he was going
00:27:40.690 well you know he called his wife and he
00:27:43.840 was asking where their kids were and
00:27:45.430 everything like that and then after that
00:27:46.860 he wanted to think about well where
00:27:50.830 could these other planes that they knew
00:27:52.810 were in the air that it hadn't struck
00:27:54.100 yet where could they be headed and this
00:27:57.040 sort of shows how self centric the
00:28:00.910 intelligence community is this is the DC
00:28:04.240 metro area right they get hit the white
00:28:06.220 house they get hit Congress they get hit
00:28:08.890 the Supreme Court right I think oh
00:28:11.220 they're gonna fly their planes into the
00:28:13.750 CIA headquarters oh they're gonna fly
00:28:15.250 their planes into the NSA headquarters
00:28:17.010 and of course it was never realistic
00:28:19.660 that these would be the targets but on
00:28:22.960 that basis they were like oh let's get
00:28:24.970 our bacon out of the pan but why say
00:28:27.880 this I'm sorry but just in the interest
00:28:30.730 of what wasn't it possible that they
00:28:33.730 could have attacked those places I mean
00:28:35.140 they attacked the Pentagon they you know
00:28:37.600 they knew that there was attacked look
00:28:39.640 it's it's absolutely possible they could
00:28:42.310 have attacked your Denny's right you
00:28:44.110 know but it's a question of risk
00:28:47.200 assessment if you have planes in the air
00:28:51.690 if you believe there's an ongoing
00:28:54.220 terrorist attack that's happening in the
00:28:55.780 United States
00:28:56.520 right now and if you have built
00:29:00.650 history's greatest surveillance agencies
00:29:03.809 right that the most powerful
00:29:06.050 intelligence forces in the history of
00:29:08.760 the species you are gonna take those off
00:29:12.030 the board or at least the majority of
00:29:13.860 their personnel off the board then in a
00:29:16.530 chance that you have no sort of grounds
00:29:19.320 for substantiating that they could be
00:29:20.850 targeting you to begin with simply
00:29:23.070 because they could well somebody else
00:29:25.530 will get hit with those as you say it's
00:29:28.590 gonna be the Pentagon right it's gonna
00:29:30.480 be the World Trade Center it's gonna be
00:29:32.910 someone somewhere and the more minutes
00:29:35.880 you're in front of that desk the higher
00:29:37.650 the chances even if it's a very small
00:29:39.390 chance even if it's somebody who doesn't
00:29:41.100 work on terrorism right maybe if it's
00:29:42.870 somebody who normally works finance in
00:29:45.870 North Korea right but they go look this
00:29:48.300 is an emergency everybody understands
00:29:49.590 you don't need to explain this you just
00:29:50.940 go stop what you're doing look at
00:29:54.059 financial transactions related to who
00:29:56.100 purchased these plane tickets and do
00:29:57.570 this you just go full spectrum and go
00:29:59.550 anything you can do right now if the
00:30:01.679 building gets hit we get hit that's what
00:30:03.300 we signed up for nobody wants that right
00:30:06.390 that that's not the desired outcome but
00:30:09.679 if they had asked the staff to do then
00:30:13.010 they all would have agreed that's what
00:30:16.140 these people signed up to do and yet the
00:30:18.240 director goes no you know we're just
00:30:19.830 just know like we're not gonna take that
00:30:22.380 writ and this is I think it says so much
00:30:25.380 about the bureaucratic character of how
00:30:29.610 government works right the people who
00:30:31.830 rise to the top of these governments
00:30:35.900 it's about risk management for them
00:30:38.940 right it's about never being criticized
00:30:41.010 for something and this is look if we
00:30:42.690 want to get really controversial this is
00:30:44.280 something that'll that'll haunt me
00:30:46.080 because people will bring it up again
00:30:48.600 and again and again people ask about you
00:30:51.360 know people still criticize me in the
00:30:54.179 book you know I talk about aliens and
00:30:55.740 chemtrails and things like that effect
00:30:56.940 there there's no evidence for that I
00:30:59.580 went looking on the network right and
00:31:02.580 III know Joey
00:31:04.740 I know you want there to be aliens a
00:31:08.730 doob I know Neil deGrasse Tyson badly
00:31:11.399 once there to be aliens and there
00:31:14.070 probably are right but the idea that
00:31:16.529 that we're hiding them if we are hiding
00:31:19.590 them I had ridiculous access to the
00:31:21.509 networks at the NSA the CIA the military
00:31:23.580 all these groups I couldn't find
00:31:26.460 anything right so if it's hidden and it
00:31:28.350 could be hidden it's hidden really damn
00:31:30.690 well even for people who are on the
00:31:32.610 inside but the main thing is conspiracy
00:31:35.970 theories right everybody wants to
00:31:37.590 believe in conspiracy theories because
00:31:39.149 it helps life make sense it helps us
00:31:42.570 believe that somebody has control in
00:31:45.090 control right that somebody is calling
00:31:46.980 the shots that these things all happen
00:31:49.230 for a reason to stand the other there
00:31:52.679 are real conspiracies but they're not
00:31:56.429 typically you know they've got tens of
00:31:59.039 thousands of people working on them
00:32:00.539 unless you're talking about the
00:32:01.470 existence of the intelligence community
00:32:02.549 itself which is basically constructed on
00:32:06.029 the idea that you can get I I think
00:32:08.639 there's a four million or 1.4 million
00:32:11.429 people in the United States who hold
00:32:13.379 security clearances and you can get all
00:32:16.619 of these people to not talk ever the
00:32:18.840 journalists in this that or the other
00:32:21.019 but when you look back at the 9/11
00:32:24.990 report and when you look back at the
00:32:26.490 history of what actually happened what
00:32:28.019 we can prove right not what we can
00:32:29.789 speculate on but what are at least two
00:32:31.049 commonly agreed facts not it's very
00:32:37.470 clear to me as someone who worked in the
00:32:40.529 intelligence community not during this
00:32:42.240 period of course I was too young but
00:32:43.860 very shortly thereafter that these
00:32:47.940 attacks could have been prevented and in
00:32:50.100 fact the government says this too but
00:32:52.799 the government goes the the reason that
00:32:54.509 they these attacks happen the reason
00:32:56.369 that they weren't prevented is what they
00:32:59.879 call stovepiping right there was there
00:33:01.889 was not enough sharing they needed to
00:33:04.019 break down the walls and the
00:33:06.240 restrictions that were chaining these
00:33:07.919 poor Patriots at the NSA and the CIA and
00:33:11.309 the FBI from all working on the same
00:33:12.509 team and to some extent they're they're
00:33:15.059 correct on this right there there were
00:33:17.100 limits on
00:33:17.779 Way agencies were supposed to play ball
00:33:19.489 with each other but I worked there and I
00:33:22.580 know how much of this is and
00:33:23.779 how much as this is not those are
00:33:28.119 procedural and policy limits in some
00:33:30.320 cases legal limits on what can be shared
00:33:32.320 without following process without doing
00:33:34.820 this that or the other without basically
00:33:37.159 asking for permission without getting a
00:33:39.109 sign-off or anything like that
00:33:41.259 if the FBI wanted to send absolutely
00:33:43.879 everything they had to the CIA they
00:33:45.889 could have done so if the CIA wanted to
00:33:47.659 send everything they had to the FBI they
00:33:49.369 could have done so they didn't and
00:33:51.979 people died as a result now government
00:33:54.349 goes bureaucratic procedural ISM was
00:33:56.869 responsible and it's because we had too
00:33:59.210 many restrictions on the intelligence
00:34:00.679 community and this is what led to the
00:34:01.909 world post 9/11 where all of our rights
00:34:03.799 sort of evaporated was they went well
00:34:05.809 restrictions on what these agencies can
00:34:07.549 do are costing lives therefore naturally
00:34:11.299 we just have to unchain these guys and
00:34:13.069 everything will be better right and if
00:34:15.799 you remember that post 9/11 moment you
00:34:19.069 can understand how that actually could
00:34:20.480 come off as persuasive how that might be
00:34:22.849 a kind of thing to go you go all right
00:34:24.289 well will that make sense because
00:34:26.149 everybody was terrified right there were
00:34:29.899 people quite quickly who got their heads
00:34:31.879 back on their shoulders the right way
00:34:33.289 there were some of them who never lost
00:34:35.210 their heads at all and who protested the
00:34:38.449 Iraq war
00:34:39.079 at the same time lion-o himself was
00:34:41.000 signing up to go fight it volunteering
00:34:43.730 for the army and we're getting into that
00:34:45.079 a minute but everything that has
00:34:52.399 followed in the decades past came from
00:34:55.909 the fact that in a moment of fear we
00:35:00.049 lost our heads and we abandoned all the
00:35:03.049 traditional constitutional restraints
00:35:05.390 that we put on these agencies and we
00:35:07.369 abandon all of the traditional political
00:35:10.029 restraints and just social constraints
00:35:12.079 ideological systems of belief about the
00:35:17.390 limitations that the secret police
00:35:19.250 should have in a free and open society
00:35:21.640 and we went look you know terrorists we
00:35:25.579 created shows like 24 and Jack Bauer
00:35:27.710 where he's like threatening knife
00:35:29.150 people's eyeballs out if they won't tell
00:35:30.619 him this that
00:35:31.210 the other and we entered this era of
00:35:36.250 increasingly unlimited government as a
00:35:38.260 result and now in hindsight we go we
00:35:41.170 should have been surprised but at the
00:35:43.750 time everyone everyone panicked trying
00:35:45.849 but if you go back to you did that help
00:35:48.430 and we know the answer now is in fact no
00:35:51.220 it did not
00:35:51.760 it made things worse I don't think any
00:35:55.480 historian is gonna look at the Bush
00:35:56.950 administration and go this improved the
00:35:59.140 position of the United States in the
00:36:00.339 world but if you go back you don't wind
00:36:05.980 back the tape to that pre 9/11 moment
00:36:08.010 lying back the tape to those silos and
00:36:10.599 those walls that they said needed to
00:36:11.920 come down because that was restraining
00:36:13.180 government instead of the rules that
00:36:14.830 said we can't share these things but
00:36:16.480 there's got to be a basis there's got to
00:36:17.950 be a justification you've got to go why
00:36:19.810 are we trading people's information like
00:36:21.369 baseball cards and all of this stuff
00:36:23.040 it's super easy as an intelligence
00:36:26.980 officer to justify sharing information
00:36:29.410 about a suspected terrorist who you
00:36:32.170 think is planning to kill people or is
00:36:34.359 even just in a country they shouldn't be
00:36:36.099 or a place they shouldn't be or doing
00:36:37.599 something you don't think they should be
00:36:39.220 with another agency because no one's
00:36:42.040 gonna question that a judge isn't gonna
00:36:43.330 question that any judge in the world
00:36:44.380 will stamp that warrant without even
00:36:46.060 thinking about it and go to bed that
00:36:47.290 night you know without a care in the
00:36:50.680 world because you're not spying on a
00:36:53.109 journalist you know spying on a human
00:36:54.280 rights defender right this is not an
00:36:55.599 edge case now this is someone that you
00:36:57.820 believe to be associated with al-qaeda
00:36:59.290 or whatever now this is all a lot of
00:37:03.339 preamble to say that essential fact
00:37:06.000 government agrees everyone agrees the
00:37:08.710 attacks probably could have been
00:37:10.000 prevented if information had been shared
00:37:12.780 so why wasn't the information shared
00:37:16.060 government says information wasn't
00:37:19.180 shared because of these restrictions and
00:37:21.670 it's half true because every important
00:37:24.010 lie has has some criminal truth to it
00:37:26.170 and and there were these barriers but
00:37:28.570 the reality is why were those barriers
00:37:30.250 respected in the case of a major
00:37:32.859 terrorist plot why wasn't the CIA
00:37:36.190 sharing information with the FBI why
00:37:38.170 wasn't the FBI sharing information with
00:37:39.490 the NSA why was the Anastacia sharing
00:37:41.020 information with the CIA in the case of
00:37:42.490 Mary major terrorists
00:37:44.620 and if you've worked in government if
00:37:47.240 you've worked in the intelligence
00:37:48.410 community if you worked in any large
00:37:49.910 institution you know if you work at a
00:37:51.530 company that sells batteries you know
00:37:54.680 that every office is fighting the other
00:37:57.230 office for budget for cloud for
00:38:00.620 promotions and this is the sad reality
00:38:02.420 of what actually happened every one of
00:38:06.590 those agencies wanted to be the guy who
00:38:08.810 busted the plot they wanted to be the
00:38:11.090 one who got credit for it and they
00:38:13.130 didn't realize how serious it was until
00:38:15.590 it was too late because they were
00:38:18.260 competing with each other rather than
00:38:20.210 cooperating that's exactly what I was
00:38:22.370 gonna ask you if that was the issue the
00:38:24.620 competition between these agencies
00:38:26.360 because they are very proud of the CIA
00:38:29.830 accomplishing something with the FBI
00:38:31.640 accomplishing something and they they
00:38:33.230 want to be the one to take credit for
00:38:35.480 that yeah and I mean I think it's
00:38:37.760 important like in their defense because
00:38:39.920 nobody else here is gonna provide a
00:38:42.380 defense for them is that that's actually
00:38:46.420 darkly human again this happens in every
00:38:50.690 industry this happens in every sort of
00:38:52.640 big corporate thing because you want to
00:38:54.350 get promoted and you know everybody's
00:38:56.270 putting in their like achievements at
00:38:57.950 the end of the year for what they did if
00:38:59.840 you're the guy who does that you're
00:39:00.980 going straight to the top but their
00:39:02.750 solutions status was the the so we we
00:39:05.810 have a weird delay here for folks that
00:39:07.400 are listening claim their solution
00:39:09.260 instead of having someone be responsible
00:39:11.690 for bridging the gap and providing that
00:39:13.310 information to each individual agency
00:39:15.110 their solution was mass surveillance
00:39:18.640 well no they're they're different things
00:39:21.320 this is 9/11 is what woke these guys up
00:39:24.530 ROM basically and they went well we
00:39:28.820 screwed up and Americans died as a
00:39:31.160 result we really don't want to take the
00:39:35.000 hit on that and to be honest the
00:39:37.070 government had no interest in putting
00:39:38.390 the hit on them to be honest the public
00:39:40.820 had no interest in putting the hit on
00:39:42.500 them at the time because everybody
00:39:46.220 understood terrorism is a real thing
00:39:48.410 there are bad people in the world and
00:39:50.540 that's true right that will always be
00:39:52.640 true there's always going to be
00:39:53.510 criminals there's always going to be
00:39:54.470 terrorists whether they're at your
00:39:56.990 Church whether they're across the ocean
00:39:58.880 there are people out there who are angry
00:40:01.520 they're disenfranchised they're violent
00:40:04.070 and they just want to harm something
00:40:08.119 they want to change something even in a
00:40:10.190 negative way because that's what they
00:40:13.970 feel is all they have left which these
00:40:18.350 are criminals right these are people
00:40:19.850 that we don't need to pity but if we
00:40:22.130 ever want to stop it we do need to
00:40:23.570 understand it and where those things
00:40:25.250 come from where there's there's drives
00:40:26.690 come from in the first place but
00:40:30.550 basically everybody went alright how do
00:40:32.630 we stop this because nobody wants to
00:40:34.400 feel unsafe nobody wants to feel like
00:40:35.750 the building's gonna come down then the
00:40:37.040 next time you go in it and so everybody
00:40:39.110 just went I don't care who does it stop
00:40:43.400 it and they said this to Dick Cheney
00:40:45.650 which is a historic mistake but cuz date
00:40:48.560 Dick Cheney knows how government works
00:40:51.260 he was the person in that White House
00:40:54.500 who was best placed to know all the
00:40:57.230 levers of government all the interagency
00:40:58.670 cooperation where we were strong where
00:41:00.410 were weak what we could do what we were
00:41:02.750 not allowed to do and what he did was he
00:41:06.410 took that little dial on what we're not
00:41:08.150 allowed to do and he changed it all the
00:41:10.790 way until it broke and snapped off and
00:41:12.980 then there was nothing that we couldn't
00:41:14.450 do anymore and you were in there why
00:41:17.840 this was happening this was this no I
00:41:19.970 was I was not again this is 2001 I was I
00:41:27.140 was 18 years old I was working on the
00:41:29.030 base I had drove past the building but
00:41:30.200 that was it this is all hindsight this
00:41:31.970 is biography this is documented history
00:41:33.650 but this is not you know the Gospel of
00:41:36.200 Edward Snowden I I don't know this right
00:41:38.060 this is public record this is Ken what
00:41:39.859 we all know what we have though the the
00:41:45.950 reason that I bring this up is this is a
00:41:47.270 teachable moment because there's so many
00:41:48.680 people right now in the Trump
00:41:50.359 administration who go look this guy has
00:41:54.050 too much power he's abusing it against
00:41:56.359 immigrants he's abusing it against
00:41:57.740 domestic ponents he's doing whatever
00:41:59.300 he's trying to hurt political rivals in
00:42:01.609 the next election all of this stuff and
00:42:04.100 you know we can get into this stuff
00:42:05.240 later if you want in detail but the
00:42:07.700 bottom line is they're going this is a
00:42:09.590 guy
00:42:10.640 who's in the White House is throwing
00:42:12.050 elbows right he doesn't really care he
00:42:13.910 wants to hurt people as long as he can
00:42:17.000 convince the Americans that those are
00:42:18.920 the bad guys right that's the enemy
00:42:20.780 doesn't matter if they're far away it
00:42:22.309 doesn't matter if they're close at home
00:42:24.280 whoever he's against he's gonna harm and
00:42:27.200 the dark thing is this is actually why
00:42:30.890 he was elected in moments of fear where
00:42:35.720 the world starts falling apart and this
00:42:37.730 happens in a thornton country after
00:42:39.140 country this is why you have Vladimir
00:42:41.630 Putin in Russia who's been there for 20
00:42:44.450 years right president for basically 20
00:42:48.079 years think about that you know he sort
00:42:50.480 of skipped in the middle there because
00:42:52.880 he had to dodge the fact that presidents
00:42:55.520 can only serve so many consecutive terms
00:42:57.140 so he dropped down a prime minister and
00:42:58.490 then came back as president but think
00:43:01.069 about that how do you get that kind of
00:43:02.960 political longevity and it's because if
00:43:05.540 you know anything about Russian history
00:43:06.859 which you know I even I don't know that
00:43:08.240 much about it the 90s after the collapse
00:43:10.490 of the Soviet Union we're an
00:43:11.690 extraordinarily dark time if you look at
00:43:14.240 Russian cinema all they had or gangster
00:43:16.760 movies right all they had were the
00:43:18.410 disintegration of society how things are
00:43:20.119 dark and broken no one trusts each other
00:43:22.579 pensions were no longer being paid
00:43:24.049 Social Security's not there anymore like
00:43:26.299 there's nothing to buy there's nothing
00:43:28.040 to do there's no job no one had a future
00:43:30.380 and so they went if there's somebody who
00:43:33.380 can lead us out of this if there's
00:43:34.579 somebody who will fix this who will find
00:43:36.559 us an enemy and defeat that enemy to
00:43:38.299 restore prosperity we'll put them in
00:43:40.460 office we see it happen in Turkey with
00:43:42.920 Iran right we've seen it happen
00:43:45.280 successively with bad governments even
00:43:47.960 in Western democracies we see it
00:43:50.809 happening sadly in places like Poland
00:43:54.829 and Hungary
00:43:55.430 you can even argue it's happening in the
00:43:58.400 United Kingdom right and now there are a
00:44:01.130 lot of people arguing that sisk exactly
00:44:02.869 what we're seeing with Donald Trump's
00:44:04.369 White House in the United States and
00:44:06.619 this is the lesson that we didn't learn
00:44:09.380 from 2001 is when we become fearful we
00:44:14.630 become vulnerable right to anyone who
00:44:18.710 promises they will make things better
00:44:20.420 even if they have no ability to make
00:44:21.920 things better even if they will actively
00:44:23.810 things worse even if they will make
00:44:25.610 things better for themselves and their
00:44:27.470 buddies by taking from you but if they
00:44:31.100 tell you that they'll make things better
00:44:33.470 and you believe them
00:44:35.390 in a moment of fear that typically leads
00:44:38.750 to unfortunate outcomes so sorry let me
00:44:40.850 let me turn this back over to you
00:44:41.990 because we got way off track there no
00:44:44.030 that's all right I want to bring it back
00:44:45.830 to the initial question so you're
00:44:47.090 working for the NSA when do you realize
00:44:49.400 there's a huge issue and when do you
00:44:51.620 feel this responsibility to let the
00:44:54.380 American people know about this issue
00:44:55.910 like when when do you contact these
00:44:58.010 journalists and what was the thought
00:44:59.510 process regarding this like what what
00:45:02.090 steps did you go through once you
00:45:03.740 realize that this was in violation of
00:45:05.900 the Constitution and that even with the
00:45:08.030 laws of the Patriot Act in the Patriot
00:45:09.560 Act two things had changed so radically
00:45:11.900 that you knew this was wrong and you had
00:45:15.470 to do something about it you felt a
00:45:16.970 responsibility to speak out okay
00:45:20.450 so since we gave so much historical
00:45:22.070 preamble let me just give the the Cliff
00:45:23.720 Notes version okay to get us up to that
00:45:26.740 so after September 11th I'm a little bit
00:45:30.500 lost I'm doing my technical stuff but it
00:45:32.240 doesn't really feel like it matters
00:45:33.590 anymore like I'm making more money I'm
00:45:35.150 becoming more accomplished but the
00:45:37.760 world's on fire right if you remember
00:45:39.890 there was a crazy mood of patriotism in
00:45:42.710 the country
00:45:43.370 because we were all trying to come
00:45:44.660 together get through it you remember
00:45:46.220 like people were sticking Dixie Cups on
00:45:48.320 the top of every chain-link fence on
00:45:49.850 every overpass that was like stand
00:45:51.530 together you know never forget mm-hmm
00:45:53.840 united we stand flags on every car
00:45:56.920 exactly and you know I was a young young
00:45:59.840 guy who is not especially political
00:46:02.270 right and I come from a military
00:46:05.690 background federal family all that stuff
00:46:08.210 and so that means I'm very vulnerable to
00:46:10.670 this kind of stuff I see it on the news
00:46:11.990 and Bush and all his sort of cronies are
00:46:15.350 going look it's al Qaeda it's terrorism
00:46:18.800 terrorist organization they have all
00:46:20.750 these international connections
00:46:22.160 there's Iraq you know dictators weapons
00:46:25.280 of mass destruction they're holding the
00:46:26.750 world at ransom you got Colin Powell at
00:46:29.330 the UN dangling little vials of like
00:46:31.460 fake anthrax
00:46:33.730 and so I felt an obligation to do my
00:46:35.680 part and so I've volunteered to join the
00:46:37.120 army yeah you you probably can't tell
00:46:39.670 from from looking at me but I'm not
00:46:40.960 gonna be at the top of the MMA circuit
00:46:43.180 anytime soon so it didn't work out I
00:46:47.620 joined a special program that was called
00:46:49.870 the 18 X ray program where they take you
00:46:51.700 in off the street and they actually give
00:46:53.050 you a shot at becoming a Special Forces
00:46:54.580 soldier so you train harder and special
00:46:57.910 platoons you go further and I ended up
00:47:00.100 breaking my legs basically so they put
00:47:02.110 me out of your legs discharged
00:47:04.000 yeah it was basically what it was when
00:47:06.520 they were shin splints that I was too
00:47:08.950 dumb to get off of right so I kept
00:47:12.040 marching under wait I'm a pretty light
00:47:13.450 guy to begin with I had a 24 inch waist
00:47:16.030 when I when I joined the army girls are
00:47:19.000 jealous my way yeah I think I weighed
00:47:22.030 like a hundred and twenty-eight pounds
00:47:24.450 III got I was in great shape you know in
00:47:27.520 boot camp because I came up really quick
00:47:29.260 because it was a you know all I could do
00:47:32.290 was gain but it was it was just too much
00:47:35.920 on my frame because I wasn't that that
00:47:37.600 active and so when you keep running on a
00:47:41.860 stress injury right and you're running
00:47:43.720 under weight with like rucksacks and
00:47:45.160 things like that you're running in like
00:47:46.540 boots and then you're doing exercises
00:47:49.780 and the Army's like a whole chapter in
00:47:51.340 the book you you got your battle buddy
00:47:53.500 right because they never allow you to be
00:47:54.820 alone I was gonna have somebody watching
00:47:56.590 you they thought it was funny to put me
00:48:00.550 the smallest guy in the platoon that the
00:48:02.680 drill sergeants did with the biggest
00:48:04.780 dude in the platoon it was like an
00:48:06.400 amateur bodybuilders like you know 230
00:48:08.940 260 something like that he's a big
00:48:10.930 fellow and so you know he would uh when
00:48:14.230 we're off in the woods doing these these
00:48:15.670 marches and things like that we have to
00:48:17.140 practice but he carries like the
00:48:18.580 fireman's carry and things like that he
00:48:20.320 throws me around his neck you know I'm
00:48:22.450 like a towel he's just skipping down
00:48:24.130 like it's nothing and then I gotta put
00:48:26.410 him on me and I'm just like oh god die
00:48:28.750 and it was it was it was weirdly fun I I
00:48:33.460 enjoyed it but it was no good for my
00:48:35.620 body and so in a land navigation
00:48:36.700 movement I step off a log because I was
00:48:39.910 on point and on the other side of the
00:48:41.800 log because it's the woods in Georgia
00:48:43.300 I'm at Sand Hill
00:48:45.300 I see a snake and so in my memory you
00:48:51.359 know it's like time slows down because
00:48:54.420 North Carolina you know where I grew up
00:48:56.400 you think all snakes are poisonous sorry
00:49:00.180 there's an issue we know we're good it's
00:49:02.339 completely fine no we're fine I just
00:49:04.020 there was something that happened on the
00:49:05.430 screen I wanted to make sure it was okay
00:49:06.829 no that's just so by joining the chat
00:49:09.270 that's what I was worried about ii
00:49:11.460 opened up here yeah so anyway I try to
00:49:15.869 take a much longer step in midair I land
00:49:18.829 badly and it's it's just one leg is like
00:49:23.579 fire I'm limping I'm limping and
00:49:24.990 whipping but you know everybody says
00:49:27.660 don't go to sick call cuz you go to sick
00:49:29.220 call you lose your slot you'll end up
00:49:30.839 general infantry our regular infantry
00:49:34.190 and so I go back I just tough it out I
00:49:38.099 get my rack in the next morning when I
00:49:40.200 get out of the rack which is the the top
00:49:41.849 bunk bed right
00:49:44.010 I jump down in my legs they just give
00:49:46.560 out underneath me and I try to get up in
00:49:49.020 and I just can't get up and so I got a
00:49:51.180 sick call and I end up going to the
00:49:52.770 hospital and they end up x-ray and me
00:49:55.230 and they also x-rayed my battle buddy
00:49:56.640 because I gotta go there was somebody
00:49:57.750 else and he has a broken hip where they
00:50:00.780 had to bring him to surgery and it's in
00:50:02.760 the book there's a lot more detail about
00:50:04.560 it was kind of a dramatic moment but for
00:50:07.349 me they just said I had bilateral tibial
00:50:09.210 fractures right all the way up my legs
00:50:11.099 they said I had spiderwebs and the next
00:50:15.230 phase of the training was jump school
00:50:18.599 right where you gotta jump out of a
00:50:20.730 plane and the doctor you know I was like
00:50:23.690 son
00:50:24.930 if you jump on those legs they're gonna
00:50:28.500 turn into powder and he's like I can
00:50:30.869 hold you back you know we can put you
00:50:34.680 for like six months you stay off them
00:50:36.420 then you can go back through through the
00:50:38.880 whole cycle right start basic from
00:50:40.740 scratch but you'll lose your slot in the
00:50:43.950 special forces pipeline because of the
00:50:47.069 way these things are scheduled and
00:50:48.180 everything like that and then you'll
00:50:49.859 basically be reassigned to the needs of
00:50:51.180 the army or which probably meant I was
00:50:55.740 going back to IT which was what I joined
00:50:57.359 the army
00:50:58.040 kind of escape or you can go out on this
00:51:03.170 special kind of discharge that's called
00:51:04.880 an administrative discharge right
00:51:06.470 normally got honorable discharge
00:51:08.630 dishonorable discharge things like that
00:51:10.190 this is something for people who have
00:51:11.690 been in for I think less than six months
00:51:13.610 where it's like a mulling a marriage
00:51:15.890 it's as if it never happened is is if
00:51:18.470 you never joined and at the time I was
00:51:22.100 like well you know that's very kind of
00:51:23.510 him to do that
00:51:25.190 and I took it you know they they dissent
00:51:27.410 me to sit call or sorry the sickbay
00:51:30.400 where you're in like the medical platoon
00:51:32.630 and you do nothing for I think about a
00:51:37.580 month and then then they let you out
00:51:40.940 once the paperwork all finishes but in
00:51:43.340 hindsight I realized that if you take it
00:51:46.190 administrative discharge it exempts the
00:51:49.100 army for liability for your injuries so
00:51:52.610 actually what I thought was a kindness
00:51:54.050 was just you know now if I had future
00:51:56.540 problems with my legs they wouldn't have
00:51:59.120 to cover it or health insurance on any
00:52:00.530 of those things anyways it was just a
00:52:02.600 funny thing but anyway I get out of the
00:52:04.040 army and here I'm on crutches for a long
00:52:09.560 time and just sort of trying to figure
00:52:12.740 out all right well what's next in life
00:52:16.360 because I had gotten basic security
00:52:19.460 clearance just for going through signing
00:52:21.740 up for the military process I applied
00:52:24.770 for a security guard position at the
00:52:28.340 University of Maryland because it said
00:52:30.140 you had to get a top-secret clearance
00:52:31.910 which was with a higher clearance than I
00:52:33.260 had at time and I went well that sounds
00:52:36.380 good because I knew if I combine my IT
00:52:38.360 skills which were now suddenly much more
00:52:41.000 relevant again to my future with the
00:52:42.950 top-secret security clearance because of
00:52:44.840 the way it works if you have a
00:52:46.580 top-secret security clearance and tech
00:52:48.470 skills you get paid a ridiculous amount
00:52:50.300 of money for doing very little work so I
00:52:53.090 was like alright well you know I can
00:52:54.710 basically make twice what I would be
00:52:56.360 making in the private sector working for
00:52:59.060 government at this level at this phase
00:53:00.440 because what we talked about earlier
00:53:02.720 with September 11th and how the
00:53:04.640 intelligence community change they no
00:53:07.190 longer cared that I hadn't graduated
00:53:09.320 from college right and I had gotten
00:53:11.290 GED just by going in and taking a test
00:53:13.180 so for government purposes it was the
00:53:16.000 same as if I was a high school graduate
00:53:17.500 so now suddenly it was like these these
00:53:20.590 doors are open now this University of
00:53:23.440 Maryland facility turned out to be an
00:53:26.980 NSA facility it was called a castle the
00:53:32.080 center for the Advanced Study of
00:53:33.490 language at the University of Maryland
00:53:35.530 College Park and all I was was literally
00:53:40.090 a security guy walking around with with
00:53:42.280 a walkie-talkie making sure nobody
00:53:43.930 breaks in at night managing the
00:53:46.030 electronic alarm system and things like
00:53:48.040 that but once I had my foot in the door
00:53:52.120 there I could start climbing ladder step
00:53:54.820 by step and I applied for or I went to a
00:54:00.070 job fair actually that was only for
00:54:03.070 people who had security clearances and I
00:54:06.580 ended up going to the table for one of
00:54:08.050 the technical companies it was a little
00:54:09.520 tiny subcontractor nobody's ever heard
00:54:11.230 of and they said you know we've got tons
00:54:15.640 of positions for somebody like you
00:54:17.920 are you comfortable working nights and I
00:54:20.650 was like yeah you know I wake up in the
00:54:22.840 middle of day anyway that that's fine
00:54:24.880 with me
00:54:25.440 and suddenly I've gone from working for
00:54:30.430 the NSA through a university in a weird
00:54:33.400 way where it's like the NSA holds the
00:54:34.990 clearance but I'm formerly an employee
00:54:37.570 of the state of Maryland at the the
00:54:39.040 college and this is government man it's
00:54:40.540 all these weird dodges and boondoggles
00:54:43.090 for how people are employed there now
00:54:45.220 suddenly I'm working at CIA headquarters
00:54:48.570 right the place where all the movies
00:54:51.070 show you swoop over the marble seal and
00:54:52.990 everything like that I'm the king of the
00:54:55.360 castle right I'm there at the middle of
00:54:56.800 the night when no one else is there the
00:54:59.230 lights are on motion sensors it's the
00:55:01.570 creepiest thing in the world there's
00:55:03.460 like flags on the wall that are just
00:55:05.770 like gently billowing in the
00:55:07.990 air-conditioning like ghosts the hallway
00:55:10.750 lights up as you walk alongside it
00:55:12.820 because it's like a green building and
00:55:14.440 they disappear behind you and there's
00:55:17.680 there's no one there I can go down to
00:55:19.060 the gym at like 2:00 o'clock in the
00:55:21.610 morning at the CIA
00:55:23.320 and it's like not see a soul on the
00:55:25.600 other side of the building then go all
00:55:26.740 the way back and this kind of thing was
00:55:30.700 was my end because they were like look
00:55:32.260 it's the nightshift nothing that bad is
00:55:35.440 gonna happen um but it was on a very
00:55:37.560 senior technical team that was basically
00:55:41.890 handling systems administration for
00:55:43.690 everybody in the Washington Metropolitan
00:55:46.390 Area right so every basically CIA server
00:55:52.020 this is a computer system that like data
00:55:54.760 is stored on the reporting is stored on
00:55:56.950 that traffic is moved on all of this
00:55:59.440 stuff
00:56:00.550 suddenly me this is a circa 2005 I think
00:56:09.750 I'm in charge of and it's just me and
00:56:13.360 one other guy on the night shift and if
00:56:15.370 you're interested in the book there's a
00:56:16.570 lot of detail on this but I get sort of
00:56:20.890 scouted from this position because they
00:56:22.420 realize I actually know a lot about
00:56:23.650 technology they were expecting me just
00:56:26.200 to basically make sure the building
00:56:28.600 doesn't burn down all these systems
00:56:30.310 don't go down overnight and then never
00:56:33.640 come back up but they go well are you
00:56:37.570 willing to go overseas and to a young
00:56:40.990 man at that age that's actually like hey
00:56:42.700 that sounds kind of exciting you know
00:56:44.050 who doesn't want to go work overseas for
00:56:46.060 the CIA and there's a lot of people
00:56:49.900 listening the podcast who are like oh
00:56:51.850 not me wait the CIA's the bad guys right
00:56:57.850 yeah exactly they're like what are you
00:56:59.230 gonna go overthrow a government
00:57:00.040 somewhere but you have to understand
00:57:02.380 that I'm still very much a true believer
00:57:04.660 the government is like the living
00:57:06.700 compressed embodiment of truth and
00:57:09.220 goodness and light you know the shining
00:57:11.290 city on the hill so I want to do my part
00:57:13.630 to spread that to the world I didn't
00:57:16.930 have skepticism is really what I'm
00:57:20.020 trying to establish here and so I sign
00:57:23.560 up and I go through this special
00:57:25.210 training school like people hear in
00:57:27.130 movies about the farm which is down at
00:57:29.710 Camp Peary in Virginia I'm sent that's
00:57:32.380 actually much more secret facility
00:57:35.599 called the hill which is in Warrenton
00:57:38.480 Virginia and this is been covered a few
00:57:43.400 times and open-source media but I think
00:57:47.240 this is one of the few book length
00:57:49.240 discussions of what happens there in
00:57:51.849 permanent record
00:57:54.640 but yeah so I go through training and
00:57:57.170 then I get assigned overseas and I end
00:57:59.240 up in Geneva Switzerland
00:58:00.500 undercover as a diplomat right I think
00:58:02.480 I'm my formal title for the embassy is
00:58:06.109 like something super playing like
00:58:08.029 diplomatic attache and what I am is I'm
00:58:11.839 a forward deployed tech guy they send
00:58:13.640 you through this school to make you into
00:58:15.470 kind of a MacGyver right yes you can
00:58:18.890 handle all the computers but you can
00:58:21.170 also handle the connections for the
00:58:24.380 Embassy's Power Systems right the actual
00:58:27.339 electrical connections you can handle
00:58:29.960 the HVAC systems right you can handle
00:58:32.720 locks and alarms and security systems
00:58:35.829 basically anything that's got an on
00:58:38.210 button on it at the Embassy that's
00:58:40.369 secure now you're responsible for and I
00:58:43.490 traveled from Geneva to other countries
00:58:47.059 in Europe for sort of assignments and it
00:58:50.390 was like it was an exciting time I
00:58:52.519 actually still enjoyed it but this was
00:58:56.930 where I first working with intelligence
00:58:59.630 started to get doubts and the story's
00:59:01.670 been told many times so I won't go over
00:59:03.740 in full detail here but the CIA does
00:59:10.240 primarily and it's not the only thing
00:59:12.349 they do what's called human intelligence
00:59:15.640 now there are many different types of
00:59:18.920 intelligence than the intelligence
00:59:20.900 community is responsible for the primary
00:59:25.099 ones are human intelligence and signals
00:59:27.799 intelligence you want to think of
00:59:28.849 signals intelligence right as tapping
00:59:31.970 lines hacking computers all of these
00:59:36.049 sort of things that provide electronic
00:59:37.970 information anything that's digital or
00:59:40.640 analog signal that can be intercepted
00:59:42.740 then turned into information human
00:59:44.839 intelligence is you know all that fun
00:59:47.000 stuff we've heard the CI
00:59:48.270 for decades and decades which is where
00:59:52.020 they try to turn people basically they
00:59:54.480 say look we'll give you money if you
00:59:55.830 sell out your country they don't it's
00:59:59.370 not even your country a lot of times
01:00:01.110 it's your like organization these guys
01:00:03.420 could be working for a
01:00:04.170 telecommunications provider and they
01:00:06.540 want to sell customer records over they
01:00:08.010 worked at a bank which was the thing
01:00:09.720 that I saw and we wanted records on the
01:00:11.790 banks customers so he wanted a guy on
01:00:13.470 the inside but anyway that that's sort
01:00:17.400 of how it works and what I saw was they
01:00:19.470 were way more aggressive for the lowest
01:00:24.480 stakes than was reasonable or
01:00:26.820 responsible they were totally willing to
01:00:29.430 destroy somebody's life just on the off
01:00:32.130 chance they would get some information
01:00:33.810 that would that wouldn't even be a
01:00:35.210 tremendously valuable and so you know
01:00:38.250 ethically thatthat struck me as a bit
01:00:42.270 off but I let it pass because what I
01:00:46.620 what I've learned over my life short
01:00:50.970 though it's it's been you know it's that
01:00:55.320 skepticism is something that needs to
01:00:56.880 build up over time it's a skill
01:00:58.650 something that needs to be practiced or
01:01:00.870 you can think of it as something that
01:01:03.090 you developed through exposure I kind of
01:01:05.040 like a radiation poisoning but in a
01:01:07.350 positive way it's when you start to
01:01:09.900 realize inconsistencies or hypocrisy
01:01:14.880 that Ward lies and you notice them and
01:01:20.790 you know you you give somebody the
01:01:22.350 benefit of the doubt or you trust them
01:01:24.630 or you think it's all right but then
01:01:25.710 over time you see it's not an isolated
01:01:28.590 instance it's a pattern behavior and
01:01:30.630 over time that exposure to inconsistency
01:01:34.260 builds and builds and builds until it's
01:01:35.940 something that you can no longer ignore
01:01:37.880 now after the CIA I went to the NSA in
01:01:43.050 Japan where I was working there in Tokyo
01:01:45.470 and then from there a couple years later
01:01:48.360 I went to the CIA again now I was
01:01:53.280 working as a private employee for Dell
01:01:54.780 but I was the senior technical official
01:01:56.850 on Dells Sales Account the CIA
01:01:59.940 you know people these big companies they
01:02:01.470 have say
01:02:01.920 accounts to the CIA and so this means
01:02:04.290 I'm going in and now it's crazy because
01:02:06.660 I'm still a very young man but I'm
01:02:08.640 sitting across the table from Chiefs of
01:02:10.710 these enormous CIA divisions I'm sitting
01:02:12.960 across from their chief technology
01:02:14.609 officer for the entire agency or the
01:02:17.549 chief intelligent her chief information
01:02:19.559 officer for the entire CIA and these
01:02:23.520 guys are going look here's a problems
01:02:25.109 here's what we want to do and it's my
01:02:26.280 job to pitch them a system right and
01:02:29.430 I've got paired up with this sales guy
01:02:31.380 and the whole thing is just go how much
01:02:33.660 money can we get out of the government
01:02:35.640 right that's the whole goal and we'll
01:02:37.890 build them what we were pitching was a
01:02:39.750 private cloud system right everybody
01:02:41.579 knows about cloud computing now it's
01:02:44.069 like why your Gmail account is available
01:02:46.140 wherever you go it's why Facebook has
01:02:47.819 this massive system of records for
01:02:50.549 everyone everywhere the government
01:02:52.859 wanted to have these kind of
01:02:53.940 capabilities to Dell ended up getting
01:02:55.710 beat out by Amazon people well you know
01:02:58.920 some people aren't familiar with this
01:03:00.089 many of them are but Amazon runs a
01:03:03.030 secret cloud system for the government I
01:03:06.589 forget what they've rebranded it now but
01:03:09.930 this is just there's this massive
01:03:11.640 connection between industry and
01:03:14.069 government in the classified space that
01:03:15.839 just goes deeper and deeper and deeper
01:03:17.130 and deeper but at this point I I was
01:03:20.700 already I had misgivings because of what
01:03:23.369 I'd seen in Japan about government but I
01:03:26.250 was just trying to get by I was trying
01:03:30.450 to ignore the conflicts I was trying to
01:03:33.299 ignore the inconsistencies and I think
01:03:36.780 this is a state that a lot of people in
01:03:40.109 these large institutions not just in our
01:03:43.020 country but around the world I struggle
01:03:45.210 with every day right there they got a
01:03:46.440 job they got a family they got bills
01:03:48.630 that they're just trying to get by and
01:03:51.119 they know that some of the things
01:03:52.920 they're doing are not good things they
01:03:55.049 know some of the things they're doing
01:03:56.250 are actively wrong but they know what
01:03:59.339 happens to people who rock the boat
01:04:04.160 eventually
01:04:06.790 I changed my mind and when I had gone to
01:04:12.400 Hawaii which was the final position in
01:04:16.030 my career with the intelligence
01:04:17.290 community I was because of an accident
01:04:25.000 of history here I wasn't supposed to be
01:04:27.010 in this position at all I was supposed
01:04:29.590 to be at a group called the national
01:04:32.500 threat Operations Center and talk but
01:04:36.310 because of the way contracting works and
01:04:38.530 again this is covered in the book I end
01:04:44.260 up being reassigned to this little
01:04:46.780 rinky-dink office that nobody's ever
01:04:49.750 heard of in the light called the Office
01:04:51.940 of information sharing and I'm replacing
01:04:55.440 this old-timer who's about to retire a
01:04:58.270 really really nice guy but he spent most
01:05:01.480 of his days just reading novels and
01:05:03.490 doing nothing and letting people be
01:05:06.130 content to the fact there are letting
01:05:08.200 people forget that his office existed
01:05:10.030 because he was the only one in it
01:05:12.150 there's there's a manager who's like
01:05:14.350 over him but it's actually over a larger
01:05:16.660 group and he just looks over him as sort
01:05:18.610 of a favor so now I come in and now I'm
01:05:21.700 the sole employee of the office of
01:05:23.680 information sharing but I'm not close
01:05:25.270 enough to retirement that I'm ok with
01:05:28.390 just doing nothing at all so I get in
01:05:31.750 business and I come up with this idea
01:05:34.150 for a new system called the heartbeat
01:05:36.780 and what the heartbeat is gonna do is
01:05:41.970 connect to basically every information
01:05:45.850 repository in the intelligence community
01:05:48.490 both at the NSA and across Network
01:05:51.730 boundaries which you normally can't
01:05:53.230 cross but because I've worked at both
01:05:54.820 the CIA and the NSA I knew the network
01:05:58.030 well enough both sides of it sides that
01:06:00.010 normal workers at the NSA would never
01:06:01.750 have seen because you have to be in one
01:06:03.310 or the other I could actually connect
01:06:05.080 these together I could build bridges
01:06:06.610 across this kind of network space and
01:06:11.320 then draw all of these or
01:06:14.950 records into a new kind of system that
01:06:18.609 was supposed to look at your digital ID
01:06:21.300 basically your your sort of ID card that
01:06:25.300 says this is who I am I work for this
01:06:27.910 agency I work in this office these are
01:06:30.970 my assignments these are my group
01:06:33.400 affiliations and because of that the
01:06:36.040 system would be able to eventually
01:06:38.190 aggregate records that were relevant to
01:06:40.930 your job that were related to you and
01:06:43.450 then it could provide them and basically
01:06:44.859 you could hit this site it would be an
01:06:47.109 update of what we used to call read
01:06:48.520 boards which were manually created there
01:06:52.960 we go look you work in network defense
01:06:57.339 right these are all the things that are
01:06:58.660 happening on a network defense you work
01:07:00.339 on I don't know economic takeovers in
01:07:03.280 Guatemala you know if this is what's
01:07:05.829 going on for you there but in my off
01:07:09.460 time I helped the team that sat next to
01:07:13.180 me which was a systems administration
01:07:14.859 team for a for Windows Networks because
01:07:16.839 I had been microsoft certified systems
01:07:18.700 engineer' which means basically I knew
01:07:22.210 how to take care of Windows networks and
01:07:25.180 this was all those guys did and they
01:07:27.280 always had way too much work way too
01:07:29.500 much work and I had basically no work
01:07:32.230 that I needed to do at all
01:07:34.349 because all I was supposed to do was
01:07:37.359 share information which was not
01:07:39.480 something that was particularly in
01:07:43.030 demand because most people already knew
01:07:46.450 what they wanted her what they needed so
01:07:47.859 it was basically my job was to sit there
01:07:49.930 and collect a paycheck unless I wanted
01:07:51.940 to get ambitious and so I did some side
01:07:55.510 gigs for these other guys and one of
01:07:57.400 them was running what were called dirty
01:07:58.780 word searches now dirty word searches
01:08:04.569 are let me let me dial this back because
01:08:08.319 I know we're sort of this is hard to
01:08:12.609 track everything that the NSA does in
01:08:19.238 large part is classified everything the
01:08:22.689 CIA does in large part is classified
01:08:27.380 if I made lunch plans with other people
01:08:30.448 in my office it was classified that was
01:08:33.299 the policy it's dumb they this over
01:08:35.698 classification problem is one of the
01:08:38.130 central flaws in government right now
01:08:40.109 this is the reason we don't understand
01:08:41.639 what they're doing this is why they can
01:08:42.750 get on wrong way this is why they can
01:08:45.059 get away with breaking the law or
01:08:46.559 violating our rights for so long you
01:08:49.078 know five years ten years fifteen fifty
01:08:51.149 years before they see before we see what
01:08:54.389 they were doing and it's because of this
01:08:56.219 routine classification right but every
01:09:00.750 system computer system has a limit on
01:09:04.189 what level of classified information is
01:09:06.960 supposed to be stored on it and we've
01:09:09.270 got all these complicated systems for
01:09:11.488 code words and caveats that establish a
01:09:16.710 system of what's called compartment
01:09:18.448 ation and this is the idea when you work
01:09:20.250 at the CIA when you work at the NSA
01:09:21.809 you're not supposed to know what's
01:09:24.089 happening in the office next to you
01:09:26.429 right because you don't have
01:09:28.649 need-to-know right again that thing from
01:09:30.689 the movies and the reason they have this
01:09:35.609 is they don't want one person to be able
01:09:36.988 to go and know everything Ryan tell
01:09:39.389 everybody everything they don't want
01:09:41.969 anybody to know too much particularly
01:09:43.979 when they're doing lots of bad things
01:09:45.618 because then there's the risk that you
01:09:47.609 realize they're doing so many bad things
01:09:49.139 that it's passed the point that we can
01:09:51.960 justify and they might develop sort of
01:09:54.539 an ideological objection to that well in
01:09:59.460 the office of information sharing and
01:10:01.440 actually in basically every part of my
01:10:03.809 career before that I had access to
01:10:06.119 everything I had what was called a
01:10:10.730 special caveat on my accesses called
01:10:14.219 protec which means privileged access
01:10:16.579 what this means you're kind of super
01:10:18.989 user you know most people have all of
01:10:21.420 these controls and the kind of
01:10:22.590 information that can access but I'm in
01:10:24.750 charge of the system right people who
01:10:26.219 need information they have to get it
01:10:28.110 from somewhere they don't know even the
01:10:29.369 director of the CIA right he says I need
01:10:31.860 to know everything about this well he
01:10:33.869 doesn't know where to get it he's just a
01:10:35.340 manager somebody has to be able to
01:10:36.960 actually cross these thresholds and get
01:10:39.030 those things
01:10:39.910 that guy was me and so dirty word
01:10:42.850 searches were these kind of automated
01:10:45.670 queries that I would set up to go across
01:10:48.160 the whole network and look at all of the
01:10:51.070 different levels of classification and
01:10:52.960 compartment ation and exceptionally
01:10:54.910 controlled information that's kind of
01:10:57.040 you could think of it as above top
01:10:58.300 secret in these special compartments
01:11:01.240 right where you're not even supposed to
01:11:02.350 know what these compartments are for you
01:11:05.050 only know the code word unless you work
01:11:07.960 in them unless you have access to them
01:11:09.550 unless you read into them one day I get
01:11:12.520 a hit on the dirty word search for a
01:11:15.040 program that I'd never heard of called
01:11:18.580 stellar wind it came back because the
01:11:24.480 the little caveat for they're called
01:11:28.570 handling caveats which is like you know
01:11:30.490 you can think of like Burn After Reading
01:11:32.050 or for your eyes only but this one's
01:11:34.510 called
01:11:34.780 STL W which means stellar wind unless
01:11:37.300 you know what stellar wind is you don't
01:11:38.560 know how to handle it all I knew is it
01:11:40.210 wasn't supposed to be on my system you
01:11:42.190 know this is a little bit unusual and it
01:11:44.830 turned out this document was placed on
01:11:47.410 the system because one of the employees
01:11:49.360 who had worked on this program years
01:11:51.460 before had come to Hawaii and this
01:11:54.250 person was a lawyer I believe and they
01:11:57.760 had worked in the inspector general's
01:11:58.690 office and they had compiled a report
01:12:01.170 part of the inspector general's report
01:12:03.670 which is when the government is
01:12:05.680 investigating itself into the operations
01:12:12.670 and activities of this program well this
01:12:15.040 was the domestic mass surveillance
01:12:16.420 program that I talked about in the very
01:12:19.000 beginning of our conversation that
01:12:20.770 started under the Bush White House
01:12:22.620 stellar wind was no longer supposed to
01:12:26.050 be really an operation it had been
01:12:29.430 unveiled in a big scandal in December
01:12:33.190 2005 in the New York Times by journalist
01:12:36.520 James risin and I I'm not gonna name him
01:12:40.330 because I don't want to get it wrong
01:12:41.250 another journalist you can look at the
01:12:43.270 byline
01:12:43.969 now if you want to see their involvement
01:12:45.580 but and there's there's a lot of history
01:12:49.219 here too but um what they had found was
01:12:52.310 of course the Bush White House had
01:12:55.969 constructed a warrantless wiretapping
01:12:57.920 program if you remember the warrantless
01:12:59.180 wiretapping scandal that was affecting
01:13:01.340 everyone in the United States well
01:13:04.580 the Bush White House was really put in a
01:13:11.300 difficult position by this scandal they
01:13:13.520 would have lost the election over this
01:13:15.920 scandal because the New York Times
01:13:17.090 actually had this story in October 2004
01:13:22.100 which was the election year they were
01:13:23.930 they were ready to go with it but at
01:13:27.949 this specific request of the White House
01:13:30.400 talking to the publisher of the New York
01:13:33.260 Times Saul's burger and Bill Keller than
01:13:36.290 the executive editor of the New York
01:13:37.460 Times the New York Times said we won't
01:13:41.660 run the story because the president just
01:13:45.290 said if you run this story a month
01:13:47.690 before the election that's very tight
01:13:49.670 margin if you recall you'll have blood
01:13:52.489 on your hands and it was so close to
01:13:54.650 2001 the New York Times just went you
01:13:57.469 know what fine Americans don't need to
01:14:00.199 know that the kind of sushis big
01:14:02.480 violator they don't need to know that
01:14:06.620 the Fourth Amendment doesn't mean what
01:14:08.300 they think it means if the government
01:14:11.270 says it's alright and it's a secret you
01:14:13.010 shouldn't know about it that's fine now
01:14:15.520 December 2005 why did that change why
01:14:18.290 did the New York Times has suddenly run
01:14:19.699 this story well it's because James Rison
01:14:22.270 the reporter who found this story had
01:14:25.610 written a book and he was about to
01:14:27.590 publish this book and the New York Times
01:14:29.420 was about to be in a very uncomfortable
01:14:30.980 position of having to explain why they
01:14:33.680 didn't run this story and how they got
01:14:37.070 scooped by their own journalists and so
01:14:39.230 they finally did it but it was too late
01:14:40.550 Bush had been reelected and now he was
01:14:42.680 sweeping up the broken glass of our lost
01:14:44.960 rights so Congress the bush White House
01:14:49.610 was very effective and as I said before
01:14:51.440 telling a very few select members of
01:14:54.080 Congress that this program existed
01:14:56.389 and they told them this program existed
01:14:58.369 in ways that they wouldn't object to but
01:15:01.550 made them culpable for hiding the
01:15:04.460 existence from the program the existence
01:15:06.650 of the program from the American people
01:15:07.850 and this is why someone like Nancy
01:15:09.590 Pelosi who you wouldn't exactly think
01:15:12.080 would be buddy-buddy with George Bush
01:15:13.550 was completely okay in defending this
01:15:16.460 kind of program in fact and you know
01:15:18.080 later she said oh well she had
01:15:19.520 objections to the program that she wrote
01:15:21.770 in a letter the White House but she
01:15:23.540 never showed us the letter she went on
01:15:24.860 well that was that was classified right
01:15:27.280 and this is not to bag on her
01:15:29.900 individually it's just she's a great
01:15:31.940 example in here an unnamed example
01:15:34.130 everyone knows of how this process works
01:15:36.350 the White House will implicate certain
01:15:40.010 very powerful members of Congress in
01:15:42.110 their own criminal activity and so on
01:15:43.760 when then when the White House gets in
01:15:46.070 trouble for it the Congress has to run
01:15:48.619 cover for the White House and so what
01:15:51.020 happened was Congress passed an
01:15:54.050 emergency law in 2007 called the protect
01:15:58.909 America Act now which should have been
01:16:01.489 our first indication this is a very bad
01:16:03.920 thing because they never named a law
01:16:05.840 something like that unless something
01:16:07.400 terrible and what it did was it
01:16:11.139 retroactively Lee immunized all of the
01:16:14.300 phone companies in the United States
01:16:15.949 that had been breaking the law millions
01:16:20.060 of times a day by handing your records
01:16:23.900 over to the government which they
01:16:26.030 weren't allowed to do simply on the
01:16:28.280 basis of a letter from the president
01:16:29.570 saying please do this and these
01:16:33.290 companies went look now that we've been
01:16:35.060 uncovered now that we've been shown that
01:16:37.040 we're breaking or now that these
01:16:40.520 journalists have shown that we've broken
01:16:42.590 the law and violated the rights of
01:16:44.869 Americans and a staggering scale that
01:16:47.840 could bankrupt our companies because we
01:16:49.760 can be sued for this we will no longer
01:16:52.730 cooperate with you unless you pass a law
01:16:55.790 that says people can't sue us for having
01:16:58.250 done this and so we get the Patek
01:17:00.080 tamerica Act which stays you know as an
01:17:02.150 emergency yeah this is all public
01:17:04.460 history - yeah you can look this up on
01:17:06.170 Wikipedia you know
01:17:08.380 and so then they they go it's an
01:17:14.409 emergency law we have to pass this now
01:17:16.420 we have to keep this program active Bush
01:17:18.730 is going to end the warrantless
01:17:19.989 wiretapping program and continue it
01:17:22.270 under this new authority where it's
01:17:23.860 gonna have some special level of
01:17:25.809 oversight and these kind of things
01:17:27.070 eventually but for now we just have to
01:17:29.889 make sure people are safe again they go
01:17:32.230 to fear they say if we don't have this
01:17:34.000 program terrorist attacks will continue
01:17:36.969 you know people will die blood on your
01:17:39.099 hands blood on your hands blundering
01:17:40.329 hands think of the children protect
01:17:43.750 America Act passes the companies get off
01:17:46.960 the hook the Bush White House gets off
01:17:48.550 the hook the Congress that was then
01:17:50.530 sharing in criminal culpability for
01:17:53.040 authorizing or rather letting these
01:17:55.989 things go by without stopping them then
01:17:58.900 passes in 2008 the Foreign Intelligence
01:18:02.219 Surveillance Act Amendments of 2008 this
01:18:07.329 is called the the FAA 5-minutes Act of
01:18:10.869 2008 and rather than stopping all of the
01:18:15.610 unlawful and sort of unconstitutional
01:18:19.960 activities that the intelligence agency
01:18:21.579 was doing they continued it in different
01:18:26.440 ways simply by creating a few legal hubs
01:18:29.170 for them to jump through now this is not
01:18:32.139 to say you know these things aren't
01:18:33.790 helpful at all it's not say they're not
01:18:35.440 useful at all but it's important to
01:18:37.989 understand when the government's
01:18:40.030 response to any scandal then this
01:18:42.159 applies to any country is not to make
01:18:46.389 the activities of the person who is
01:18:48.670 caught breaking the law comply with the
01:18:50.770 law but instead make the activities of
01:18:53.829 the person who is breaking the law legal
01:18:57.040 right they make the law comply with what
01:18:59.800 the agencies want to do rather than
01:19:01.840 making the agencies comply with law
01:19:04.230 that's a problem and that's what
01:19:06.579 happened here
01:19:07.239 now the intelligence community's powers
01:19:10.449 actually grew in response to this
01:19:13.540 scandal in 2008 because Congress was on
01:19:16.239 the hook and they just wanted to move on
01:19:17.440 and get this
01:19:18.880 over with there were objections there
01:19:20.770 were people who knew this was a bad idea
01:19:22.210 but it didn't passed on now what the
01:19:24.580 public took away from this because a
01:19:26.050 part of these laws was a requirement
01:19:29.050 that the Inspector General of all of
01:19:33.520 these different intelligence community
01:19:34.810 elements and the Director of National
01:19:36.310 Intelligence submit a report saying this
01:19:41.980 is what happened under that warrantless
01:19:43.960 wiretapping program this is how it
01:19:47.110 complied with the law or how it didn't
01:19:48.520 comply with the law and basically look
01:19:51.280 back at how this program was constituted
01:19:55.480 what it did what the impacts and effects
01:19:58.540 were and that was supposed to be sort of
01:20:02.020 the Truth and Reconciliation Council
01:20:04.000 right now why am I talking about all
01:20:08.320 this ancient history well I'm sitting
01:20:10.060 here in 2012 with a classified Inspector
01:20:14.470 General's report draft report from the
01:20:16.450 NSA that names names that says Dick
01:20:21.790 Cheney it says David Addington this is
01:20:23.590 Nancy Pelosi that says all these people
01:20:25.090 who are involved in the program
01:20:26.050 the tick-tock of how it happens it says
01:20:28.540 the director of the NSA that guy who is
01:20:30.910 evacuating the building at the beginning
01:20:33.040 of our our our podcast here that guy was
01:20:38.740 asked by the President of the United
01:20:40.360 States if he would continue this program
01:20:43.060 after being told by the White House and
01:20:46.960 the Department of Justice that these
01:20:48.790 programs were not lawful that they were
01:20:50.560 not constitutional and the president
01:20:53.080 said would you continue this program on
01:20:57.880 my say-so alone knowing that it's risky
01:21:00.810 knowing that it's unlawful and he said
01:21:03.400 yes sir I will
01:21:04.630 if you think that's what's necessary to
01:21:06.280 keep the country safe and at that moment
01:21:09.100 I realize these guys don't care about
01:21:12.820 the law these guys don't care about the
01:21:14.200 Constitution these guys don't care about
01:21:15.670 the American people they care about the
01:21:17.710 continuity of government they care about
01:21:19.180 the state right and this is something
01:21:20.980 that people have lost we hear this
01:21:23.410 phrase over and over again national
01:21:25.060 security national security national
01:21:26.800 security and we're meant to interpret
01:21:28.420 that
01:21:29.210 to mean public safety but national
01:21:32.510 security is a very different thing from
01:21:33.770 public safety national security is a
01:21:35.480 thing that in previous generations we
01:21:36.980 referred to as state security national
01:21:40.550 security was a kind of term that came
01:21:42.739 out of the Bush administration to run
01:21:45.890 cover for the fact that we were
01:21:48.080 elevating a new kind of secret police
01:21:50.030 across the country and what does it mean
01:21:55.489 when again in a democracy in the United
01:21:59.719 States the public is not partner to
01:22:02.659 government the public does not hold the
01:22:04.580 leash of government anymore but we are
01:22:06.500 subject to government right we are
01:22:08.690 subordinate to government and we're not
01:22:11.840 even allowed to know that it happened no
01:22:14.360 not in in the book I tell the fact that
01:22:17.510 I had access to the unclassified version
01:22:20.929 of this report back in Japan and what's
01:22:25.250 interesting is the unclassified version
01:22:26.570 of a report and we've all seen this
01:22:28.340 today with things like the Muller report
01:22:29.929 and all of the intelligence reporting
01:22:32.270 that's happened in the last several
01:22:33.199 years when the government provides a
01:22:36.350 classified report to the public it's
01:22:38.239 normally the same document the
01:22:39.679 unclassified version the classified
01:22:41.630 version are the same thing
01:22:42.739 just the unclassified version has things
01:22:44.690 blacked out or redacted that they say oh
01:22:47.270 you're not allowed to know this sentence
01:22:48.650 for this paragraph or this page or
01:22:50.030 whatever the document that the public
01:22:53.060 had been given about the warrantless
01:22:56.540 wiretapping program was a completely
01:23:00.230 different document it was a document
01:23:03.429 tailor-made to deceive and mislead the
01:23:07.400 Congress and the public of the United
01:23:10.520 States and it was effective in doing
01:23:12.650 that and in 2012 what I realized was
01:23:17.949 this is what real-world conspiracies
01:23:20.780 look like right it doesn't have to be
01:23:25.480 smoking men behind closed doors right
01:23:28.520 it's lawyers and politicians it's
01:23:32.090 ordinary people from the working level
01:23:34.100 to the management level
01:23:35.870 who go if we don't explain this in a
01:23:40.460 certain way we're all gonna lose our
01:23:42.890 jobs or the other way they go we're
01:23:48.110 gonna get something out of this if we
01:23:49.250 all work together civilization is the
01:23:53.150 history of conspiracy right what what is
01:23:55.220 civilization but a conspiracy for all
01:23:56.960 all of us to do better by working
01:23:58.940 together right but it's this kind of
01:24:02.720 thing that I think too often we forget
01:24:06.110 because it's boring as hell I want all
01:24:08.990 your listeners right to go to the
01:24:10.910 Washington Post because this document
01:24:12.350 that I discovered that that really
01:24:13.730 changed me has been published courtesy
01:24:16.610 of The Washington Post
01:24:17.540 it's called the the inspector general's
01:24:19.730 report on on stellar wind and you can
01:24:22.790 look at the actual document that I saw
01:24:24.290 that was unredacted right I had no
01:24:27.260 blacked-out pages on mine and what I
01:24:30.620 believe it shows is that some of the
01:24:35.540 most senior officials in the United
01:24:36.680 States elected and unelected worked
01:24:41.690 together to actively undermine the
01:24:45.140 rights of the American people to give
01:24:47.930 themselves expanded powers now in their
01:24:53.000 defense they said they were seeking
01:24:55.790 these powers for a good and just and
01:24:57.500 noble cause right they say they were
01:24:59.210 trying to keep us safe but that's what
01:25:02.270 they always say that's what every
01:25:03.680 government says that's no different than
01:25:05.540 what the Chinese government says or the
01:25:06.920 Russian government says and the question
01:25:11.090 is if they are truly keeping us safe why
01:25:16.070 wouldn't they simply just tell us that
01:25:17.290 well why wouldn't they have that debate
01:25:19.520 in Congress why wouldn't they put that
01:25:21.890 to a vote because if they were and they
01:25:24.590 could convince us that they were they'd
01:25:29.000 win the vote and particularly we all
01:25:31.580 know like the Patriot Act passed more
01:25:33.620 the worst pieces of legislation in
01:25:35.210 modern history passed why didn't we get
01:25:41.630 a vote and I think if you read the
01:25:43.430 report the answer we clear so I'm sorry
01:25:45.380 Joe I went on for various no is amazing
01:25:47.660 it's act don't don't apologize at all
01:25:49.399 it's just completely fascinating that
01:25:51.949 the continuation of this policy came
01:25:54.979 down to one man and the president having
01:25:57.379 this discussion that is so well it's
01:26:02.179 it's much it's much more much more but
01:26:04.909 right right literally the president at
01:26:07.099 the heart of it yes at the heart of it
01:26:09.649 in every expression of executive power
01:26:13.219 right and by executive we mean the White
01:26:15.469 House here the CIA the NSA the FBI
01:26:19.999 the DOJ right beat these guys exist as a
01:26:23.869 part of the executive branch of
01:26:25.309 government in a real way they work for
01:26:28.159 the White House now there are laws and
01:26:30.320 regulations and policies that are
01:26:32.119 supposed to say they're supposed to do
01:26:33.260 this and they're supposed to say they're
01:26:34.550 not supposed to do that but when you
01:26:36.949 look at federal regulations when you
01:26:38.329 look at policies as an employee of
01:26:39.860 government when you violate these
01:26:42.320 policies the worst thing that happens to
01:26:45.229 you is you lose your job because there's
01:26:47.959 no criminal penalty for the violation of
01:26:50.329 these laws and so it's very easy for
01:26:55.869 people who exist in these structures
01:26:58.429 particularly the very top levels of
01:27:00.649 these structures to go look we have a
01:27:02.749 given set of lawful authorities and
01:27:05.149 these are defined very broadly to give
01:27:09.800 us leeway to do whatever it is we think
01:27:11.809 is proper and appropriate and just now
01:27:15.010 take that proper inappropriate and just
01:27:17.479 from the perspective of any given
01:27:20.119 individual Ryan any given president now
01:27:23.629 intersect that with what's good for them
01:27:26.629 politically and that's where problems
01:27:30.699 begin to arise now the safety measure
01:27:33.919 that's supposed to protect us from this
01:27:35.689 in the u.s. system in a democracy
01:27:38.559 broadly is these people are supposed to
01:27:41.599 be what are called public officials that
01:27:44.149 means we know their decisions that means
01:27:46.459 we know their policies that means we
01:27:48.320 know their programs and prerogatives and
01:27:50.599 powers like what they are doing both in
01:27:53.449 our name and what they're doing against
01:27:56.269 us and because they are transparent to
01:27:59.419 us
01:28:00.050 we the people can then police their
01:28:02.630 activities we can go and disagree with
01:28:03.889 this we can protest it
01:28:05.539 we can't campaign against and write we
01:28:07.579 can try to become the president do
01:28:09.230 whatever they are public officials and
01:28:12.860 we are private citizens they're not
01:28:15.050 supposed to know anything about us right
01:28:16.940 because we in relative terms hold no
01:28:19.519 power and they hold all the power so
01:28:21.860 they have to be under the tightest
01:28:23.030 constraints we need to be in the freest
01:28:26.090 circumstances and yet the rise of the
01:28:30.829 state-secrets doctrine right this whole
01:28:32.719 classification system that goes all the
01:28:35.030 way back to last century about the
01:28:37.489 middle of the last century I believe is
01:28:39.230 is when it really started getting tested
01:28:40.579 in court and I think you know more about
01:28:42.769 this in many cases than I do when you
01:28:45.440 start talking about what happened in the
01:28:50.900 FBI and the CIA and the NSA is sort of
01:28:53.449 old dirty work in the the 20th century
01:28:58.389 is they abused their powers repeatedly
01:29:03.019 and continuously they did active harm to
01:29:06.460 domestic politics in the United States
01:29:08.599 the FBI was spying on Martin Luther King
01:29:10.659 and trying to get Martin Luther King to
01:29:13.280 kill himself before the Nobel Prize was
01:29:16.670 going to be awarded in fact after MLK
01:29:20.599 gave his I have a dream speech two days
01:29:24.260 later the FBI classified him is the
01:29:27.199 greatest national or I think it was the
01:29:29.659 greatest national security threat in the
01:29:32.179 United States and yet this is the FBI
01:29:35.239 this is the the group that everybody's
01:29:37.400 applauding today saying all these these
01:29:38.960 wonderful Patriots and heroes now I'm
01:29:41.360 not saying everybody the FBI is bad
01:29:43.730 I'm not saying anybody everybody the CIA
01:29:45.380 and the NSA is bad I'm saying that you
01:29:47.929 don't become patriot based on where you
01:29:49.400 work
01:29:50.800 patriotism is not about a loyalty to
01:29:54.349 government patriotism in fact it's not
01:29:59.059 about loyalty to anything patriotism is
01:30:03.110 a constant effort to do good for the P
01:30:06.619 of your country right it's not about the
01:30:09.380 government it's not about the state and
01:30:13.460 this is well we'll get into loyalty
01:30:16.580 later because you know I think one of
01:30:18.619 the big criticisms against me there
01:30:20.630 should be talked about is um they go
01:30:22.940 look this guy is disloyal he broke an
01:30:25.760 oath he did whatever a loyalty loyalty
01:30:31.670 is a good thing when it's in the service
01:30:35.090 of something good but it is only good
01:30:37.429 when it's in the service of something
01:30:38.960 good if you're loyal to a bad person if
01:30:41.389 you're loyal to a bad program if you're
01:30:43.190 loyal to a bad government
01:30:44.869 that loyalty is actively harmful and I
01:30:48.230 think that's overlooked but yeah when
01:30:49.820 you get back into this whole thing about
01:30:52.119 sort of where it came from why it
01:30:57.050 happened how it could come out of just
01:30:59.570 this small group and then they could
01:31:01.790 slowly kind of poison by implication by
01:31:05.630 complicity by bringing them into the
01:31:08.090 conspiracy and then having them not say
01:31:10.040 anything about it a wider and wider
01:31:11.869 broad a body of people and then once
01:31:15.800 you've got enough people in on it it's
01:31:17.690 much easier to convince other people
01:31:18.800 that it's legitimate because they can go
01:31:20.510 look we've got 30 people who know about
01:31:22.550 this and none of them have objected to
01:31:24.830 it why are you gonna object to this all
01:31:28.010 of this derives from that original sin
01:31:30.699 which is in a democracy creating a
01:31:35.840 system of government that is in fact a
01:31:39.260 secret government a body of secret law
01:31:41.239 body of secret policy that is far beyond
01:31:45.260 what legitimate government secrets could
01:31:47.750 be this is not saying like government
01:31:49.010 hasn't can have no secrecy at all if the
01:31:51.949 government wants to investigate someone
01:31:53.830 without having them respond right we're
01:31:56.420 talking traditional law enforcement sure
01:31:58.250 you're not gonna tell this mobster hey
01:31:59.869 you know we're gonna start investigating
01:32:01.340 you we the public don't need to know the
01:32:04.040 names of every terrorist suspect out in
01:32:05.750 the world right but we do need to know
01:32:09.760 again the powers and programs the
01:32:12.409 policies that a government is asserting
01:32:14.030 at least the broad outlines of it
01:32:15.889 because otherwise how can we control it
01:32:17.360 how do we know if the government is a
01:32:19.760 it's authorities that are supposed to be
01:32:24.320 granted to it by us if we don't know
01:32:28.040 what it is that they're doing and so
01:32:30.500 this is the the main thing and really
01:32:32.420 the story behind the title permanent
01:32:34.370 record is look Joe when you were a kid
01:32:39.380 you know when I was a kid when you were
01:32:42.380 a teenager riling what's the worst thing
01:32:44.450 you've ever said you know did you say
01:32:48.500 anything you weren't proud did you do
01:32:49.970 anything that you weren't proud of
01:32:51.230 something that today in like the whoa
01:32:54.230 kissed of Twitter land you would get in
01:32:56.450 trouble for I'm sure and that's one of
01:32:59.720 the horrible things about kids growing
01:33:01.370 up today is that they do have all this
01:33:03.680 stuff out there on social media forever
01:33:05.600 and they can be judged horribly by
01:33:08.540 something they did when they were 13
01:33:10.750 it's exactly that our worst mistakes our
01:33:17.120 deepest shames were forgotten right they
01:33:21.620 were lost they were ephemeral even the
01:33:24.200 things we did get caught for they were
01:33:25.700 known for a time maybe they're still
01:33:27.800 remembered by people who are closest to
01:33:29.480 us whether we like them or dislike them
01:33:31.750 but they were people connected to us now
01:33:35.080 we're forced to live in a real way naked
01:33:38.540 before power whether we're talking about
01:33:41.180 Facebook whether we're talking about
01:33:43.190 Google whether we're talking about the
01:33:45.110 government of any country they know
01:33:48.110 everything about us or much about us
01:33:51.740 rather and we know very little about
01:33:54.380 them and we're not allowed to know more
01:33:56.420 everything that we do now lasts forever
01:33:59.330 not because we want to remember but
01:34:03.530 because we're not allowed to forget just
01:34:06.500 carrying a phone in your pocket is
01:34:07.880 enough for your movements to be
01:34:09.860 memorialized because every cell phone
01:34:12.020 tower that you pass is keeping a record
01:34:14.150 of that and 18t keeps those records
01:34:17.780 going back to 2008 under program called
01:34:21.170 Hemisphere if you search for Hemisphere
01:34:23.270 and AT&T you'll get a story in The Daily
01:34:25.400 Beast about it 18 he keeps your phone
01:34:27.680 records going back to 1983
01:34:31.210 if any year listeners were born after
01:34:33.360 1983 right born after me or it might be
01:34:36.010 1987 excuse me 1987 if they're born
01:34:39.550 after 1987 and they're 18 is he customer
01:34:42.429 or their calls cross 18 days network
01:34:44.620 ATMs he has every phone call they ever
01:34:46.420 made rather the record that had happened
01:34:49.120 not necessarily the contents on the
01:34:50.830 phone call um and so I mean let me turn
01:34:53.500 this around for you Joe cuz I feel like
01:34:55.000 I've just been given a given of speech
01:34:58.620 when you look at this stuff right when
01:35:01.780 you look at what's happening with
01:35:03.880 government when you look at what's
01:35:05.679 happening with the Trump White House the
01:35:08.170 Obama White House the Bush White House
01:35:09.760 you could see this trend happening when
01:35:12.489 you look at what's happening with
01:35:13.239 Facebook when you look at what's
01:35:14.500 happening with Google when you look the
01:35:16.120 fact that you go to every restaurant
01:35:18.070 today and you see people look at the
01:35:20.230 phones you know you get on a bus you get
01:35:22.390 on a subway you know you see somebody
01:35:24.400 sitting next to you in traffic you see
01:35:26.290 people looking at phones these devices
01:35:29.290 are connected all the time now people
01:35:31.480 are getting Alexa right now now people
01:35:33.130 have okay Google they have you know Siri
01:35:35.949 on their phones that are in their house
01:35:37.330 they've always got these connected
01:35:39.159 microphones where do you think this
01:35:42.520 leads and what is it that gives you sort
01:35:46.420 of trust in the system faith in the
01:35:47.920 system like how just-just-just so we can
01:35:51.100 start a conversation here what strikes
01:35:53.500 you about this well it's completely
01:35:56.230 alien and it's new this is something
01:35:59.140 that's unprecedented we don't have a
01:36:01.030 long human history of being completely
01:36:03.969 connected via technology this is
01:36:05.980 something we're navigating right now for
01:36:07.600 the first time and it's probably the
01:36:10.360 most powerful thing that the human race
01:36:13.840 has ever seen in terms of the
01:36:15.310 distribution of information there's
01:36:16.719 nothing that even comes close to it in
01:36:19.540 all of human history and we're figuring
01:36:21.250 it out as we go along
01:36:22.750 and what you exposed is that not only
01:36:26.650 are we figuring out as we go along but
01:36:29.409 that to cover their ass
01:36:31.780 these cellphone companies in cahoots
01:36:33.940 with the government have made it legal
01:36:35.679 for them to gather up all of your phone
01:36:38.890 calls all of your text messages all of
01:36:41.230 your emails and store them somewhere so
01:36:44.190 that retroactive Lee if you ever say
01:36:46.290 anything they don't like or do something
01:36:48.000 they don't like they can go back find
01:36:50.670 that and use it against you and we don't
01:36:53.130 know who they are we don't know why
01:36:54.690 they're doing it and we didn't know they
01:36:56.100 could do it until you exposed it the the
01:36:59.220 connection of human beings via
01:37:00.720 technology is is both amazing and
01:37:03.960 powerful and incredible in terms of our
01:37:06.360 access to knowledge but terrifying in
01:37:09.840 terms of the government's ability to
01:37:12.750 track our movements track your phone
01:37:15.120 calls track everything and under the
01:37:17.010 guise of protecting us from terrorists
01:37:19.080 and protecting us from sleeper cells
01:37:21.060 protecting us from attacks look if they
01:37:23.220 really are attacked protecting us from
01:37:25.200 these attacks that's great but there's
01:37:28.670 there's no provision in the Constitution
01:37:32.280 that allows any of this and this is
01:37:35.220 where it gets really squirrely because
01:37:36.930 they're making up the rules as they go
01:37:38.940 along and they're making up these rules
01:37:40.980 the way you're describing it this is
01:37:42.840 step by step this has happened to sort
01:37:45.240 of protect their ass and keep themselves
01:37:47.070 from being implicated in what has been a
01:37:50.370 violation of our rights and our
01:37:52.110 privacy's and the Fourth Amendment yeah
01:37:55.140 I mean I I think I think one of the
01:37:57.510 things that everybody needs to
01:38:00.990 understand when you look at these things
01:38:04.070 and the reason you know we talked about
01:38:06.570 before when I got this information why I
01:38:08.760 didn't just put it on the internet and
01:38:09.960 people criticize me for this they go I
01:38:11.640 didn't share enough information because
01:38:14.280 the journalists are gatekeeping right
01:38:16.020 they've got a big archive and they
01:38:17.580 haven't published everything from it and
01:38:18.870 I told them not to publish everything
01:38:20.730 why did you do that why did you do that
01:38:23.540 because so again I get back to
01:38:26.760 legitimate secrets an illegitimate
01:38:28.020 secrets um some spying from my
01:38:32.610 perspective you know career spy is okay
01:38:35.250 right
01:38:35.910 agreed if you have hacked a terrorists
01:38:38.430 phone right and you're getting some
01:38:39.930 information about that useful agreed
01:38:41.580 yeah if you're spying on a Russian
01:38:45.090 general in charge of a you know rocket
01:38:46.890 division useful right but there there
01:38:51.450 are lines and degrees in that where it's
01:38:53.970 not useful now the examples that I just
01:38:57.090 gave you these are
01:38:58.110 targeted this is where you're spying on
01:38:59.880 an individual there no named person that
01:39:03.300 is being monitored for a specific reason
01:39:05.310 that is related hopefully from a warrant
01:39:07.949 people write well even for foreign
01:39:11.250 intelligence and some indications you
01:39:13.590 don't need a warrant
01:39:15.600 strictly although I think they should
01:39:17.639 have warrants for all of these
01:39:18.750 investigations because they established
01:39:20.610 a court for precisely this reason called
01:39:23.219 the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
01:39:24.239 Court right yeah and there's not a judge
01:39:26.790 in the world who wouldn't stamp a
01:39:28.860 warrant saying hey spy on Abu jihad over
01:39:32.369 here right and if you want to spy on
01:39:36.619 another guy Boris badenov with the
01:39:40.139 rocket division right that that's okay
01:39:42.060 they're gonna go with that but then you
01:39:46.320 look at these edge cases and in the
01:39:49.590 archive that I provided to journalists
01:39:51.600 that meant stories that have come down
01:39:52.560 where they've spied on journalists right
01:39:54.840 they've spied on human rights groups and
01:39:57.150 these kind of things I think people miss
01:40:01.440 I'm gonna throw up some slides here so
01:40:04.020 forgive me if this gets weird and I put
01:40:06.510 up the wrong ones but since I came
01:40:09.600 forward this Foreign Intelligence
01:40:12.170 Surveillance Court that the government
01:40:14.460 says authorized these programs 15
01:40:17.580 different times was overruled by the
01:40:21.389 first open courts to look at the program
01:40:23.429 these are federal courts here right that
01:40:25.199 said no actually these programs are
01:40:26.969 unlawful they're likely unconstitutional
01:40:29.190 when you start looking at the facts you
01:40:31.920 see even within the context of the very
01:40:34.260 loose restrictions and laws that apply
01:40:36.449 to the NSA and surveillance they say
01:40:38.850 they broke their own laws you know two
01:40:42.210 thousand seven hundred and seventy six
01:40:44.219 times in a single year and then you
01:40:46.830 asked about that thing that motivates me
01:40:48.330 like why I came forward we had been
01:40:52.469 trying as a country before I came
01:40:56.159 forward to prove the existence of these
01:40:59.070 programs legally because this is our
01:41:02.670 this is our means of last sort of
01:41:05.940 recourse in our system right we get the
01:41:09.150 executive we got the legislature we got
01:41:11.969 right so Congress makes the laws the
01:41:15.400 executives supposed to carry them out
01:41:16.600 the courts are supposed to play referee
01:41:19.170 the executive had broken the laws
01:41:22.920 Congress was turning a blind eye to the
01:41:25.510 laws and the courts were and this is
01:41:29.110 just months before I came forward going
01:41:31.719 well it does appear that the ACLU and
01:41:36.760 Amnesty International like all of these
01:41:40.890 human rights groups and non-governmental
01:41:43.390 organizations had established that you
01:41:46.870 know these programs are likely unlawful
01:41:50.230 they likely exist they're simply
01:41:53.920 classified but the government responded
01:41:55.750 with this argument that you just saw
01:41:58.110 saying that well it's a state secret if
01:42:01.270 they do exist you the plaintiffs don't
01:42:03.910 have hard concrete evidence that they do
01:42:06.910 exist and the government is saying
01:42:09.100 legally you have no right to discover
01:42:12.040 evidence from the government right
01:42:13.480 documents demand documents or demand an
01:42:15.100 answer from the government as to whether
01:42:16.210 things these as to whether or not these
01:42:19.449 things exist because the government's
01:42:21.489 just gonna give its standard what they
01:42:23.410 called Glomar response we can neither
01:42:24.880 confirm nor deny that these things exist
01:42:27.690 which leaves you out in the cold which
01:42:30.400 leaves the courts out in the cold the
01:42:31.960 courts go look the government could be
01:42:34.989 breaking along here look they could be
01:42:36.760 violating the Constitution here but
01:42:38.020 because you can't prove it and because
01:42:41.350 the government doesn't wanna play ball
01:42:42.550 and the government says if we were doing
01:42:46.810 this it would be legal and it would be
01:42:49.750 necessary for national security or
01:42:51.340 whatever the court can't presume to know
01:42:54.429 national security better than the
01:42:56.350 executive because the courts aren't
01:42:58.120 elected and so this leads to this
01:43:01.330 fundamentally broken system where okay
01:43:03.219 if the only way to have the courts
01:43:05.170 review the legality of the programs is
01:43:07.989 to establish the programs exist but the
01:43:11.050 programs are classified so you can't
01:43:12.940 establish they exist unless you have
01:43:15.100 evidence but providing that evidence to
01:43:17.650 courts to journalists to anyone is a
01:43:21.730 felony right that's punishable by 10
01:43:24.010 years per count
01:43:24.960 the Espionage Act and the government has
01:43:27.420 charged every a source of Public
01:43:30.390 Interest journalism who's really made a
01:43:32.640 significant difference in these kind of
01:43:33.989 cases since Daniel Ellsberg really going
01:43:37.110 back to that under the same Espionage
01:43:39.450 Act it's always the same law and this is
01:43:41.520 there's no distinction to government
01:43:43.770 between whether you've sold information
01:43:45.480 to a foreign government for private
01:43:47.580 benefit right or whether you provide an
01:43:51.840 information only to journalists for the
01:43:54.450 public interest and then that's a
01:43:56.760 fundamentally harmful thing I think when
01:44:00.840 you look at things that have come in the
01:44:04.830 wake of this we're talking about the the
01:44:06.150 post 2013 court rulings that found what
01:44:09.690 the government was doing was unlawful
01:44:12.290 you see the courts saying actually that
01:44:15.330 leaks or air quotes leaks can actually
01:44:20.250 be beneficial leak is used in the
01:44:24.719 government's and this you know this is
01:44:25.980 from a federal court these are not
01:44:27.239 exactly my biggest supporters they are
01:44:29.340 recognizing that although leak implies
01:44:32.340 harm it implies something that's broken
01:44:34.380 it's actually helpful it's a leak that's
01:44:36.480 letting in daylight in this context that
01:44:39.840 is the only thing that allows the system
01:44:44.550 to operate in a context where one year
01:44:48.300 before I came forward
01:44:49.650 we had the NSA saying this kind of stuff
01:44:51.870 didn't happen
01:44:53.430 we had hang on this famous exchange
01:44:57.690 which more than anything
01:44:58.980 made me realize this was a point of no
01:45:00.780 return because I've told you this you've
01:45:02.310 heard this but if you haven't seen it
01:45:06.260 you might not believe me right maybe I'm
01:45:09.000 a sketchy guy whatever one of those
01:45:11.640 senators I told you that objected to
01:45:13.140 this stuff that was doing the lassie
01:45:14.580 barks for all those years
01:45:15.960 Ron Wyden was confronting the most
01:45:19.230 senior spy in the United States a
01:45:21.330 General James clapper who was then the
01:45:24.300 Director of National Intelligence right
01:45:26.120 there's no guy higher than him the buck
01:45:29.310 stops with him when it comes to
01:45:30.390 intelligence he's testifying under oath
01:45:33.150 in front of Congress right but more
01:45:35.550 broadly in front of the
01:45:36.960 public this is televised and ron wyden
01:45:39.300 asked him a very specific question about
01:45:41.160 a program mind you that ron wyden knows
01:45:44.540 exists because he has security clearance
01:45:46.920 he sits on the Intelligence Committee
01:45:48.560 and he knows there's domestic mass
01:45:50.790 surveillance and this is how it goes
01:45:52.260 this is how the top spy responds under
01:45:54.060 oath so what I wanted to see is if you
01:46:00.900 could give me a yes or no answer to the
01:46:02.700 question does the NSA collect any type
01:46:05.969 of data at all on millions or hundreds
01:46:09.870 of millions of Americans no sir it does
01:46:14.730 not
01:46:16.219 not wittingly there are cases where they
01:46:20.400 could inadvertently perhaps collect but
01:46:24.300 not not wittingly so that was a lie
01:46:31.680 Wyden knew it was a lie clapper knew it
01:46:34.350 was a lie he actually admitted it was a
01:46:36.570 lie after I came forward you know three
01:46:39.540 months later but he said it was the
01:46:42.810 least untruthful thing he could think of
01:46:45.690 to say in the context of being in the
01:46:48.270 hot seat there but what does it mean for
01:46:51.840 a democracy when you can lie under oath
01:46:53.370 to Congress and the congressman even
01:46:55.050 knows you're lying to them but they're
01:46:57.510 afraid to correct you and widened by the
01:47:00.750 way it wasn't a surprise Wyden gave him
01:47:02.520 those questions twenty-four hours in
01:47:03.810 advance and he wrote a letter afterwards
01:47:06.780 asking for clapper to amend his
01:47:08.640 testimony right now not even at a press
01:47:10.650 conference but just to say this was
01:47:12.630 incorrect whatever so he could go
01:47:15.030 through the legal process and show his
01:47:16.860 fellow congressmen that there was a
01:47:19.200 problem and they needed to do it but all
01:47:21.030 of that was refused to us all of it was
01:47:23.330 denied to us and Here I am sitting at
01:47:26.850 the NSA next to my buddies who I've
01:47:29.190 talked to about these programs you know
01:47:31.410 I've gone look at this and they're
01:47:33.930 laughing at it you know I'm laughing at
01:47:36.030 it and it's not it's not that we go oh
01:47:37.620 ha ha ha he's getting away with it it's
01:47:40.050 like what are you gonna do these guys
01:47:41.790 are you know they're they're
01:47:42.780 bullshitters that the system is built
01:47:45.980 online
01:47:47.380 that even many people many experts who
01:47:50.620 have studied this know are lies but if
01:47:53.890 you can't prove their lies how do you
01:47:57.430 move beyond that and that's really a
01:47:59.530 question that has never been more
01:48:00.850 relevant than I think it is today under
01:48:03.430 the current White House so you're in
01:48:06.520 this position where you have this
01:48:07.900 information and you know that these
01:48:10.650 surveillance systems are in place and
01:48:13.270 they're unconstitutional and you feel
01:48:15.850 this deep responsibility to let the
01:48:17.920 American people know about this what
01:48:20.350 what makes you take the leap so this is
01:48:26.910 covered extensively in the book because
01:48:32.320 it took a long time I would imagine
01:48:34.120 people people you know yeah right
01:48:37.270 exactly people like to think it's like a
01:48:39.370 cinematic moment where I find this
01:48:43.120 golden document like this stellar wind
01:48:44.530 report and that's the closest thing to a
01:48:46.540 smoking gun right that exists but look
01:48:51.160 if you found that you you can read that
01:48:52.690 later look at that and like imagine
01:48:54.100 yourself being like oh I'm gonna go
01:48:55.780 outside on the courthouse steps and wave
01:48:57.460 this thing burn my life to the ground
01:48:59.140 burn my family to the ground I'm never
01:49:00.640 going to be work again I'm going to jail
01:49:03.160 for the rest of my life the question is
01:49:07.300 what would it take for you to light a
01:49:09.160 match and burn your life to the ground
01:49:16.920 too long the answer was nothing and I'm
01:49:21.600 ashamed of that it took me so long to
01:49:29.040 get over that home because I was waiting
01:49:31.030 for somebody else to do it when I saw
01:49:33.570 people like Ron Wyden on this when I saw
01:49:37.390 people like the court case that I showed
01:49:38.950 before where people were actively
01:49:40.300 challenging these programs right
01:49:41.640 journalists had the scent of it and you
01:49:45.310 know there are a lot of people who are
01:49:46.750 gonna be in the you knows of the YouTube
01:49:48.880 comments or whatever go oh I knew this
01:49:50.440 was happening no you didn't well Bill
01:49:52.450 bimini you had he bill Binney he built
01:49:55.750 built excuse me bill Binney he initially
01:49:57.850 was the one that came out and spoke
01:50:00.490 about
01:50:01.090 this issue and so yeah bill Benny is a
01:50:06.909 part of shall we say the group of early
01:50:09.190 NSA whistleblowers who came with Thomas
01:50:11.170 Drake bill Benny Kirk Wiebe I believe in
01:50:14.290 Edie Loomis and these guys all got their
01:50:16.929 doors kicked and you know they got
01:50:18.699 harassed by the FBI Tom Drake who was a
01:50:22.360 senior executive at the NSA this is a
01:50:24.159 guy who had a lot to lose was charged
01:50:26.710 under the same law was the Espionage Act
01:50:28.449 and these guys were doing it earlier
01:50:30.159 during the Bush administration some of
01:50:32.349 them were talking to the journalists
01:50:34.000 that in you know maybe it's alleged I
01:50:36.340 don't want to put them on the spot maybe
01:50:37.540 they deny it maybe they don't leave that
01:50:40.030 to them but somebody somewhere was
01:50:44.889 informing this reporting right that got
01:50:46.929 into the New York Times about the Bush
01:50:48.310 era warrantless wiretapping program and
01:50:50.469 eventually journalists put this out
01:50:51.639 there people knew these capabilities
01:50:53.290 existed but yeah then there's the person
01:50:56.980 in the YouTube comments so it's like oh
01:50:58.090 we knew all about this is nothing new
01:50:59.530 and the thing is you can know about some
01:51:01.480 programs and not know about others you
01:51:03.429 can have a suspicion you can know with a
01:51:05.619 certainty that this stuff is capable or
01:51:07.449 it is possible to capability exists you
01:51:10.150 can know that the government has done
01:51:11.260 this stuff in the past you can know they
01:51:12.760 are likely to do it again you can have
01:51:14.590 all these indications you can have like
01:51:16.810 the jewel versus NSA case that's run by
01:51:20.020 the e FF which is about the eighteen or
01:51:22.810 it's about AT&T
01:51:24.270 setting up secret rooms in their
01:51:28.020 telecommunications facilities where they
01:51:30.219 basically drag all the fibers for their
01:51:33.520 domestic Internet communications and
01:51:36.070 like phone communications into a room
01:51:38.590 that's purpose-built for the NSA and
01:51:40.510 then they bring it out but AT&T Nuys
01:51:43.659 it's the NSA the NSA denies that these
01:51:47.349 things happen or that are done at all
01:51:49.480 right and so this is the context I you
01:51:53.020 say you know and you know let's put it
01:51:55.300 the other way maybe you do know right
01:51:56.889 maybe you are an academic researcher
01:51:59.110 maybe your technological specialist
01:52:02.050 maybe you're just somebody who reads all
01:52:04.719 the reporting and you actually know you
01:52:07.389 can't prove it but you know this is
01:52:09.219 going on but that's the thing in a
01:52:11.110 democracy the distance
01:52:14.090 between speculation and fact the
01:52:16.820 distance between what you know and what
01:52:19.580 you can prove to everybody else in the
01:52:21.380 country is everything in our model of
01:52:24.440 government because what you know doesn't
01:52:26.690 matter what matters is what we all know
01:52:29.900 and the only way we can all know it is
01:52:31.490 if somebody can prove it if you can
01:52:32.990 prove it and if you don't have the
01:52:33.980 evidence you can't prove it and of
01:52:36.140 course when we talk about the earlier
01:52:37.430 stuff right like this or more
01:52:39.290 corporatized media they've got a
01:52:41.870 thousand incentives not to get involved
01:52:44.480 in this stuff they need access to the
01:52:46.250 White House they need these officials to
01:52:47.900 sit down with them and give interviews
01:52:49.760 right that's constant content that they
01:52:51.950 need that's access that they need they
01:52:54.020 need to be taken seriously they need to
01:52:55.790 be a you know admitted to briefers it is
01:52:59.120 a codependent relationship and yet
01:53:05.860 rather and so the only way to make sure
01:53:10.100 people understand this broadly is if we
01:53:12.890 all work together all right
01:53:14.810 if we collectively can establish a
01:53:18.230 corpus of evidence right a body of facts
01:53:21.340 that is so large and so persuasive it
01:53:26.420 overcomes the natural and understandable
01:53:29.530 resistance of these more corporatized
01:53:32.090 media groups it overcomes the political
01:53:36.500 and partisan sort of loyalties that that
01:53:39.080 all of these political factions in the
01:53:41.120 country do where they go you know it's
01:53:43.190 it's my president even if I don't like
01:53:45.110 this stuff even if I don't agree with
01:53:46.520 this stuff I don't want to say it exists
01:53:48.710 I want to deny it until it's proved you
01:53:50.900 know in HD on video you know signing the
01:53:55.040 order to do this that or the other
01:53:56.650 because otherwise this is a chance my
01:53:58.670 guy might not get reelected and that's
01:54:00.920 the only way this kind of stuff can
01:54:02.240 happen and the sad fact is the
01:54:05.360 opportunities that we have to prove this
01:54:07.610 like the the moments in history where we
01:54:09.440 do prove something anything beyond a
01:54:12.530 reasonable doubt are so few and so rare
01:54:17.630 that they almost always only come from
01:54:20.810 whistleblowers and I think that's
01:54:24.260 one of the problems that we have
01:54:26.350 particularly in that the climate
01:54:27.920 movement did look go ahead I'm sorry did
01:54:31.880 you take any comfort from knowing that
01:54:34.820 Obama when he was running for office and
01:54:37.100 in his hope and change website he had
01:54:39.410 provisions to protect whistleblowers and
01:54:42.520 provisions to to reward people right I
01:54:47.480 mean do you remember all that I mean it
01:54:48.770 was eventually redacted or eventually
01:54:50.480 deleted it from the website from yes but
01:54:54.260 that was a big part of his program or
01:54:57.230 what he was running on was that when
01:54:59.360 people were exposing unlawful activity
01:55:02.090 he was going to protect those people did
01:55:05.030 that did you take any comfort in this
01:55:06.380 one campaigned well Obama also during
01:55:09.860 his campaign said he campaigned actively
01:55:12.530 against the warrantless wiretapping the
01:55:14.270 bush ministration because remember
01:55:16.210 Bush's in the scandal in the height of
01:55:18.320 this on 2007 you know the elections
01:55:21.170 coming up right after and he's going oh
01:55:23.630 bomb Assange uh you know that's not who
01:55:27.620 we are right not what we do and yet
01:55:31.580 within a hundred days of him becoming
01:55:33.590 president now he's sitting in that chair
01:55:36.470 rather than extinguishing these programs
01:55:38.720 he embraces them and expands why do you
01:55:41.060 think that is more entrenched I think
01:55:43.730 it's actually again what we talked about
01:55:45.650 earlier first thing every time a new
01:55:49.550 president comes into the White House
01:55:51.580 they get their clearances right they get
01:55:54.560 read into all this stuff during the
01:55:56.480 campaign they get clearance isn't to get
01:55:58.040 rid of that stuff but when they find the
01:55:59.780 president right now they're the only
01:56:01.880 people who can sign what these are
01:56:03.800 called the covert action findings and
01:56:06.260 things like that which are basically you
01:56:08.900 know the intelligence community wants to
01:56:10.640 assassinate somebody they want to run
01:56:12.170 this illegal program here there or
01:56:14.000 everywhere and they can't do it because
01:56:17.720 their executive agencies without that
01:56:19.700 top level executive sign-off fine so
01:56:21.800 they got to open the vest right they got
01:56:23.330 to get these guys on on side
01:56:26.599 and basically every president since
01:56:31.650 Kennedy they have been successful in
01:56:34.679 what they call fearing up where as soon
01:56:37.650 as they come in
01:56:39.090 they lead you read you the litany of
01:56:41.159 Horrible's and they go these are all the
01:56:43.199 threats that we're facing and let's be
01:56:46.110 real it is a dangerous world it's not
01:56:48.929 just all made-up BS some of it is right
01:56:52.650 where it's inflated it's not that it's
01:56:54.599 completely false but they make it sound
01:56:56.369 more serious than it actually is but
01:56:59.849 there are real bad people out there who
01:57:01.500 are trying to do real bad things and you
01:57:03.570 have just gone through a hellish
01:57:05.400 election because our our electoral
01:57:08.639 politics are so diseased and now after
01:57:14.280 you've crawled through fire you're
01:57:15.960 already thinking four years ahead you
01:57:18.000 know how how do I stay in this seat and
01:57:20.309 these guys are basically saying if you
01:57:23.639 don't do X Y & Z this is gonna fall on
01:57:26.969 your lap and the implication which I
01:57:29.159 don't think they actually say but every
01:57:30.869 president knows is these guys can
01:57:33.690 undermine you to death if you've got the
01:57:37.079 ISEE against you right they can
01:57:40.110 Stonewall you they can put out stories
01:57:42.840 that are gonna be problematic for you
01:57:44.210 every day your presidency and it's not
01:57:48.780 that it's necessarily gonna gonna catch
01:57:50.610 you out of the White House but it's a
01:57:52.469 problem that as president you very much
01:57:54.179 don't want so in the most charitable
01:57:57.210 interpretation of this you've got a new
01:57:59.699 guy coming in in Obama's case this is a
01:58:01.530 pretty young guy doesn't focus in this
01:58:05.280 kind of national security foreign policy
01:58:08.040 stuff throughout his earlier career he's
01:58:09.480 more interested in domestic policy and
01:58:11.849 always has been that's actually one of
01:58:13.139 the positive things to say about Barack
01:58:14.790 Obama he's just trying to make things
01:58:17.489 better at home and now suddenly they go
01:58:19.500 look you need to worry about this
01:58:21.750 country you need to worry about this
01:58:23.040 group that you've never heard of you
01:58:24.210 need to worry about you know this
01:58:25.409 technology you need to do all this stuff
01:58:27.139 and the only reason we can tell you this
01:58:30.690 stuff and the only thing dividing
01:58:34.260 America and the abyss are these terrible
01:58:37.650 terrible terrible terror
01:58:39.130 programs right that are in fact
01:58:41.980 wonderful things because they keep back
01:58:44.380 the darkness and so here's here's the
01:58:48.250 real problem every president hears that
01:58:51.940 and every president you know first off
01:58:53.500 they've got so many other things do is
01:58:55.150 they just kind of nod their head and
01:58:56.409 they'll go I'll deal with this later in
01:58:58.030 my administration and this is one of the
01:59:00.130 ironies when I come came forward in 2013
01:59:02.850 right this is now Barack Obama's second
01:59:05.500 term president one of the responses that
01:59:09.130 they had to the mass surveillance of the
01:59:10.690 scandal was yes we think they went a
01:59:13.330 little too far this is after the initial
01:59:14.980 thing where they went nobody's listening
01:59:16.540 to your phone calls you know just made a
01:59:18.610 data right nobody nobody can have a
01:59:22.530 perfect privacy and also have perfect
01:59:25.210 security so we got to sort of divide a
01:59:27.159 line here between the Constitution and
01:59:30.219 you know what the government wants to do
01:59:31.830 but they said we were gonna get to it we
01:59:39.070 knew these programs were problematic but
01:59:41.170 if they just gave us more time we would
01:59:43.870 have fixed them maybe it's true right
01:59:46.750 seems awful convenient in hindsight that
01:59:49.300 throughout the entirety the first time
01:59:50.650 well it seems like what you would say if
01:59:52.540 you got caught right right right but
01:59:56.400 look in if we're being the most generous
02:00:00.570 that we are here the president is
02:00:03.550 briefed on real and legitimate threats
02:00:06.040 and they scare the hell out of them I'm
02:00:08.590 sure and we can we can all imagine being
02:00:11.920 there right those those of us who
02:00:13.150 remember what the world was like post
02:00:14.710 9/11 fear is a powerful thing but the
02:00:17.710 guys who are doing that briefing they're
02:00:21.730 no longer scared of it because they've
02:00:24.190 been dealing with this for years this is
02:00:25.540 the oldest thing they've given this
02:00:26.590 briefing times before you know when we
02:00:28.360 talk about people talk about the deep
02:00:30.010 state right they talk about it like some
02:00:32.969 conspiracy of lizard people it's not
02:00:35.860 that it's something much simpler the
02:00:37.840 deep state is simply the career
02:00:39.100 government it's the people who are in
02:00:40.989 the same offices who outlive and outlast
02:00:43.900 presidents is right they've seen
02:00:45.670 Republicans they've seen Democrats they
02:00:47.590 don't really care
02:00:49.420 and they give that same briefing again
02:00:51.400 and again and they get good at it they
02:00:53.349 know what they want they know what this
02:00:55.869 person saying where's the president they
02:00:58.719 don't know who these people are these
02:01:01.030 people who've been there before the
02:01:02.440 president they're gonna be there after
02:01:03.429 the president and so they give this very
02:01:06.460 effective very fear inducing speech and
02:01:08.949 then they followed up with their asks
02:01:11.590 which are really demands just politely
02:01:15.550 provided and anyone in that position who
02:01:19.090 is not an expert on this stuff who is
02:01:22.000 not ready for this sort of trade off and
02:01:26.020 who you have to understand is a career
02:01:28.000 politician is entirely used to the horse
02:01:31.900 trading game Rango and I'll deal with
02:01:33.550 this later or not now or what are the
02:01:36.190 this the cost-benefit here and the
02:01:38.110 intelligence community goes if you give
02:01:39.969 us what we want no one will ever know
02:01:43.510 about it because it's classified it's
02:01:46.719 obviously the easy answer and maybe
02:01:49.739 Barack Obama and honestly did want to
02:01:52.599 get to this later but what we can say
02:01:54.790 today is for all the good that may have
02:01:59.409 been done in that White House this is an
02:02:01.690 issue where the president went through
02:02:03.790 two full terms and did not fix the
02:02:06.489 problem but in fact made it worse well
02:02:08.650 it seems like the president has a job
02:02:11.530 it's absolutely impossible and if you
02:02:13.360 come across someone who has been in the
02:02:15.250 position like you know someone who's the
02:02:17.320 head of an intelligence agency for a
02:02:18.730 long time and it's very persuasive and
02:02:21.489 has some you know legitimate credentials
02:02:24.340 that show that he's very good at his job
02:02:25.960 but he tells you this is important for
02:02:27.760 national security we need to keep these
02:02:29.469 things in place it doesn't seem like any
02:02:33.099 one person can run the country and be
02:02:35.679 aware of every single program that every
02:02:37.960 single agency is implementing it seems
02:02:40.210 completely unrealistic and the the job
02:02:42.159 itself it just it doesn't seem like any
02:02:44.889 person can do it adequately and when it
02:02:47.110 comes to something like this mass
02:02:49.060 surveillance state I could see a
02:02:52.960 president being persuaded by someone who
02:02:56.080 comes to him and says this is why we
02:02:59.050 need to do this yeah I mean
02:03:03.010 one of the things that I think is the
02:03:06.790 underlying problem and everything that
02:03:08.830 you just described as the president has
02:03:10.270 too much power right and because they
02:03:13.330 have too much power that means they have
02:03:14.440 too much responsibility and I I don't
02:03:16.930 think people understand if they haven't
02:03:19.810 lived outside the United States if they
02:03:21.520 haven't sort of traveled or studied
02:03:22.900 broadly just how exceptional the
02:03:26.080 American presidency is most countries
02:03:28.870 don't have a single individual with this
02:03:31.570 level of power it's really only the
02:03:35.290 super States and and that may be by
02:03:40.030 design perhaps that's why they're
02:03:41.440 they're super States but when we look at
02:03:45.300 sort of complex advanced democracies
02:03:48.190 that are more peaceful they tend to have
02:03:51.250 a more multilateral system that has more
02:03:53.890 people involved in smaller portfolios
02:03:56.260 and a lot of this derives from just the
02:03:58.420 size of the government like you said you
02:04:00.280 know the president is responsible for
02:04:01.480 basically everything executive branch
02:04:03.190 and the executive branch is basically
02:04:04.510 every agency that actually doesn't work
02:04:06.900 and so how do you how do you correct for
02:04:12.550 that without breaking it up where you
02:04:15.280 have smaller ministers and ministries
02:04:17.350 and things like that that have different
02:04:19.150 levels of responsibility having a
02:04:20.860 smaller government overall you know back
02:04:22.660 in 1776 the federal government you know
02:04:27.310 was pretty much a dream
02:04:29.350 we weren't even interested in having
02:04:32.170 standing armies the idea of an army that
02:04:34.330 existed from year to year was terrifying
02:04:37.180 forbidding thing and then when you move
02:04:42.670 to this idea that we have a president
02:04:44.680 that they have these extraordinary
02:04:45.580 powers it's okay because the
02:04:47.470 government's very small the federal
02:04:48.940 government especially is seen as sort of
02:04:50.710 this small and toothless and weak thing
02:04:52.300 keep pause for one second is Spain pause
02:04:54.790 for one second because my ear pods are
02:04:56.590 about to die and I'm gonna swap over to
02:04:58.390 another pair these these suckers are
02:05:00.489 good for a couple hours but we're two
02:05:02.950 hours and 15 minutes here we'll have a
02:05:05.440 little bit of a weird audio issue with
02:05:08.020 the last half of it but Jamie Jamie I'll
02:05:09.940 take care of it I wanted to talk about
02:05:12.040 you like where you are right now in your
02:05:14.890 life and how your hand
02:05:16.010 this cuz you've been in exile for how
02:05:19.579 many years now it's been more than six
02:05:22.789 years six six years of 2013 yeah I mean
02:05:26.570 well actually I left May so what is life
02:05:30.110 like I mean are you in constant hiding I
02:05:34.579 mean what what are the issues like in in
02:05:39.050 the beginning my operational security
02:05:43.699 level as we would call it was was very
02:05:46.340 high I was concerned about being
02:05:50.420 recognized was concerned about being
02:05:51.769 followed I was concerned really about
02:05:54.920 very bad things happening to me because
02:05:57.170 the the government made it very clear
02:05:58.699 that from their position I was the most
02:06:00.170 wanted man in the world they literally
02:06:03.230 brought down the president of Bolivia
02:06:06.199 his aircraft and would not let it depart
02:06:09.769 as it tried to cross the airspace of
02:06:11.869 Europe not even the United States they
02:06:15.590 wouldn't let it leave until they
02:06:16.550 confirmed I was not on board so yeah
02:06:19.309 that made me a little bit nervous but
02:06:21.139 you can't live like that forever and
02:06:24.260 although I was as careful as I could be
02:06:27.400 my still lived pretty happily because I
02:06:31.909 was an indoor cat to begin with right
02:06:33.320 I've always been a technologist I've
02:06:35.269 always been pretty nerdy so as long as I
02:06:38.329 have a screen an internet connection I
02:06:40.250 was pretty happy but in the years past
02:06:44.119 my life has become more and more open
02:06:45.739 you know now I speak openly I live
02:06:48.500 openly I go out I ride the Metro I go to
02:06:51.019 restaurants like you know how often II
02:06:53.090 recognized so this is a funny thing as
02:06:56.750 I'm almost never recognized one of those
02:06:59.780 things is I don't give Russian
02:07:01.639 interviews because I don't want my face
02:07:04.550 all over the news which is nice because
02:07:08.269 it just allows people to sort of forget
02:07:10.519 about my face and I can go about my life
02:07:15.039 but I it's one of the weird things that
02:07:18.380 I'm recognized a couple times a year
02:07:21.190 even when I'm not wearing my glasses in
02:07:26.090 a museum or a grocery store or something
02:07:28.699 like that or out on the street
02:07:30.489 just by somebody who I swear like these
02:07:32.380 people are you might have read a story
02:07:35.260 about them like super recognizers the
02:07:36.909 people just have a great memory for
02:07:38.440 faces yeah because I can be like ooh Oh
02:07:43.090 wearing a hood and like a jacket it can
02:07:46.059 have a scarf around my face like in the
02:07:47.619 winter and it like you can barely see my
02:07:50.409 face and they'll come up to me and
02:07:52.329 they're like are you Snowden and I'm
02:07:54.999 like whoa that's what he uses pretty
02:07:57.519 impressive I'd say yeah it's nice to
02:08:01.030 meet you
02:08:02.469 and yeah they've it's I've never had a
02:08:05.380 negative interaction from being
02:08:07.749 recognized but for me none because I'm a
02:08:10.210 privacy advocate like I would much
02:08:12.070 rather go unrecognized like I don't want
02:08:14.469 to be a celebrity but the other thing is
02:08:18.340 I'll get recognized in computer stores
02:08:21.489 and I think there's just like a mental
02:08:23.260 Association where people are like their
02:08:26.949 brain when it's cycling through faces
02:08:29.349 that it recognizes it's going through
02:08:31.090 like the subset of nerdier people or
02:08:32.949 something like that when you're in a
02:08:34.059 computer store because for whatever
02:08:35.829 reason I'm recognized much more
02:08:38.889 frequently when there's some kind of
02:08:40.480 technological like locusts hmm so you're
02:08:45.789 living freely did you had to learn
02:08:47.800 Russian did you learn it yeah me my my
02:08:51.070 Russian is still pretty crappy to talk
02:08:53.980 to my great shame because all of my life
02:08:56.559 all of my work is primarily aimed right
02:08:58.690 right no you've talked about returning
02:09:02.829 home if you could get a fair trial is is
02:09:06.039 that a feasible thing a fair trial for
02:09:10.960 someone like you is that such a well is
02:09:13.210 that yeah that even possible question I
02:09:16.170 mean look if we're being Frank III I
02:09:21.489 think all your audience knows the chance
02:09:24.070 of me getting a fair shake in the
02:09:26.139 Eastern District of Virginia a couple
02:09:28.690 miles from the headquarters of the CIA
02:09:30.300 is probably pretty slim because that's
02:09:33.400 where they draw the jury pool from right
02:09:36.059 but my objection here is on a larger
02:09:41.349 print
02:09:42.229 right what what happens to me is less
02:09:44.479 important right if I spend the rest of
02:09:46.159 my life in jail that that's less
02:09:47.719 important then what I'm actually
02:09:49.820 requiring the government to agree to
02:09:51.800 which is a single thing right they say
02:09:54.289 face the music face the music and I'm
02:09:55.579 saying great let's pick the song the
02:09:59.150 thing is the law that I've been charged
02:10:02.929 under the one that all these
02:10:04.099 whistleblowers have been charged owner
02:10:05.300 Thomas Drake Daniel Ellsberg Chelsea
02:10:07.789 Manning Daniel Hale the drone
02:10:10.070 whistleblower who is in prison right now
02:10:12.709 going through a trial that is precisely
02:10:14.479 similar to what I would be facing his
02:10:17.780 lawyer is asking the court or telling
02:10:21.979 the court that we want to tell the jury
02:10:24.610 why he did what he did that the
02:10:27.979 government is violating the laws a
02:10:30.170 government is violating human rights
02:10:31.989 that these programs are immoral that
02:10:34.610 they're unethical this is what motivated
02:10:39.349 this guy to do it and the jury should be
02:10:42.019 able to hear why he did what he did and
02:10:43.909 the jury should be able to decide
02:10:45.440 whether that was right or wrong and the
02:10:48.559 government has responded you know to
02:10:51.409 this whistleblower argument basically
02:10:53.239 saying we demand the court forbid this
02:10:56.840 guy from breathing the word
02:10:58.550 whistleblower in court he cannot talk
02:11:01.130 about what motivated him he cannot talk
02:11:03.349 about what was revealed why it was
02:11:05.209 revealed what the impacts and effects
02:11:06.860 were if he can't talk about whether the
02:11:09.079 public benefited from it or was harmed
02:11:10.969 by it because it doesn't matter now this
02:11:14.360 might surprise a lot of people because
02:11:15.800 to a lot of us we think that's what a
02:11:17.239 jury trial is we think that's what a
02:11:18.590 fair trial is but the Espionage Act that
02:11:22.820 the government uses against
02:11:23.809 whistleblowers meaning broadly here the
02:11:26.059 sources of journalism is fairly unique
02:11:31.340 in the legal system in that it is what's
02:11:33.559 called a strict liability crime a strict
02:11:37.219 liability crime is what the government
02:11:40.130 considers to be basically a crime worse
02:11:41.690 than murder because if you if you
02:11:43.969 murdered somebody like if you just don't
02:11:46.550 know beat Jamie with the microphone
02:11:48.139 stand right now
02:11:52.340 you would be able to go to the court and
02:11:54.170 say it was self-defense
02:11:55.310 right yeah you you you felt threatened
02:11:58.730 you were in danger for your life even if
02:12:00.230 you weren't right even you obviously
02:12:02.510 weren't even if you were on tape you
02:12:04.670 could still argue that and the jury
02:12:06.590 could go you full of crap right and they
02:12:09.020 could convict you but if you were in
02:12:11.630 fact acting in self-defense if the jury
02:12:13.490 did in fact believe you they could take
02:12:15.830 that into consideration in establishing
02:12:17.660 their verdict
02:12:18.320 right strict liability crime forbid then
02:12:21.500 the jury is not allowed to consider why
02:12:26.240 you committed a crime they're only
02:12:28.700 allowed to consider if you committed a
02:12:31.970 crime they are not allowed to consider
02:12:34.100 if the murder was justified they are
02:12:35.600 only allowed to consider if the murder
02:12:37.190 took place and the funny thing in this
02:12:38.960 case is that the murder that we're
02:12:41.840 talking about is telling the truth the
02:12:45.140 Espionage Act in every case is a law the
02:12:50.150 government exclusively uses against
02:12:52.760 people who told the truth right like
02:12:55.100 that that's what it's about in the
02:12:56.330 context of journalism they don't bring
02:12:58.340 the Espionage Act against people who
02:13:00.290 lied then they would use fraud or some
02:13:02.180 other statute they say the government is
02:13:05.870 arguing in the context of whistleblowing
02:13:07.640 the telling a telling a important truth
02:13:11.590 to the American people by way of a
02:13:14.600 journalist is a crime worse than murder
02:13:17.060 and I believe and I think most Americans
02:13:19.430 would agree this is fundamentally in
02:13:21.770 defensively wrong and so my whole
02:13:25.280 argument with the United States
02:13:26.180 government since the very beginning was
02:13:28.100 been I'll be back for a jury trial
02:13:30.080 tomorrow but you have to agree to permit
02:13:33.580 whistleblowers a public interest offense
02:13:35.840 it doesn't matter whether they are
02:13:37.040 whistleblower or not it's just they
02:13:39.260 argued it's the jury that decides
02:13:41.060 whether they are always will blower or
02:13:42.650 not if they have to be able to consider
02:13:44.750 the motivations of why someone did what
02:13:46.490 they did the government says we refuse
02:13:49.730 to allow that because that puts the
02:13:52.250 government on trial and we don't trust
02:13:54.710 the jury to consider those questions Wow
02:13:57.710 so you have had these conversations then
02:14:00.290 so this has been discussed no this is
02:14:02.300 this is from the Obama administration
02:14:04.119 there's been no contact since since the
02:14:07.270 Trump administration because the
02:14:09.340 government basically when they got to
02:14:11.170 this point they went we have no good
02:14:12.730 argument against this and we will never
02:14:15.250 permit this to happen and again I just
02:14:17.320 want to make clear this is not
02:14:19.199 speculation this is not me thinking this
02:14:22.840 is actively happening in the case of
02:14:24.760 Daniel Hale right now I hope you guys
02:14:26.679 can pull up a graphic for because this
02:14:30.159 story just the papers like two or three
02:14:32.409 weeks ago saying the government is
02:14:35.020 forbidding this guy from from making
02:14:36.580 this argument so you're sitting in a
02:14:41.320 state of limbo then you're they're not
02:14:43.270 actively pursuing you it seems that if
02:14:46.300 you're able to move around freely they
02:14:48.610 they haven't discovered where you are
02:14:50.230 you're just free to live your life you
02:14:52.020 well yeah it's one of these things where
02:14:55.920 you know whether they know where I am or
02:14:59.380 whether they don't know where I am where
02:15:01.360 I put my head on the pillow doesn't
02:15:02.530 matter so much I'm in Russia right and
02:15:04.989 and we should lean into that because I
02:15:06.730 think people they hear Russia
02:15:08.590 particularly in the context of today's
02:15:10.420 news and you see like what people are
02:15:12.280 saying about tulsi gabbard and things
02:15:13.900 like yeah any kind of Association any
02:15:19.239 any time your name appears in the same
02:15:21.699 sentence in paragraphs same story is the
02:15:24.460 word Russia it's considered a negative
02:15:26.110 thing now yeah and don't get me wrong
02:15:28.570 I've been a longtime critic of the
02:15:29.949 Russian government
02:15:30.639 I just actually had a major story
02:15:33.369 written about me in a Russian state news
02:15:36.659 outlet called RIA Novosti you guys could
02:15:40.840 probably pull it it's only in Russian
02:15:42.699 though that's saying because I spoke
02:15:46.900 favorably about a member of the Russian
02:15:49.989 opposition Alexei Navalny which I wasn't
02:15:54.940 even speaking positively about this guy
02:15:56.920 I was saying look I think people have a
02:15:58.960 right to express their opposition in a
02:16:03.130 country and they should be able to do
02:16:05.199 that without fearing retaliation in the
02:16:07.449 future because the background here is
02:16:09.520 this this opposition figure has been a
02:16:12.219 long time
02:16:13.780 in the Russian administration side and
02:16:16.920 they've just suddenly magically been
02:16:21.370 accused of being foreign agents or
02:16:23.260 something like that and so everyone
02:16:26.350 connected to this which is like a big
02:16:27.850 civil society body I had their doors
02:16:30.219 like simultaneously kicked in across the
02:16:32.110 country and they're being investigated
02:16:33.280 for some kind of corruption or something
02:16:34.990 indeed doesn't even matter and you know
02:16:38.500 I I said I opposed that just like I was
02:16:40.269 tweeting you know footage of ballot
02:16:43.660 stuffing in the Russian elections just
02:16:45.429 like I've criticized the Russian
02:16:46.570 president my name I've criticized
02:16:49.080 Russian surveillance laws so many things
02:16:52.269 again and again and again and again and
02:16:53.769 again but yeah so look it does not make
02:16:57.700 my life easier to be trapped in a
02:17:01.120 country that I did not choose and people
02:17:02.860 don't remember this I was actually on
02:17:04.299 route to Latin America when the US
02:17:06.728 government canceled my passport which
02:17:08.260 trapped me in Russia and for those who
02:17:09.910 are interested again I wrote an entire
02:17:11.769 book that has a lot of detail on this
02:17:15.360 but yeah it's difficult to be basically
02:17:22.120 engaged in civil opposition to policies
02:17:26.019 of the United States government at the
02:17:27.459 same time as the Russian government and
02:17:30.780 it's it's a hard thing you know a it's
02:17:34.209 not a happy thing but I feel like it's a
02:17:35.978 necessary thing the problem is nobody
02:17:38.049 wants to talk about that nobody wants to
02:17:39.728 engage in that kind of nuance nobody
02:17:41.228 wants to consider it those kind of
02:17:42.490 conversations in the current world
02:17:44.978 people believe and this sexy were the
02:17:47.200 worst things that Western media does in
02:17:50.920 in the context of discussing Russia is
02:17:53.769 they create this aura of invincibility
02:17:54.910 around the Russian president they go you
02:17:57.040 know this guy's calling all the shots
02:17:58.120 he's pulling all the strings you know
02:17:59.860 this guy's in charge of the world and
02:18:02.349 that's very useful for the Russian
02:18:06.580 government broadly because they can then
02:18:08.709 take that and replay that on their
02:18:10.240 domestic media and they go look how
02:18:11.709 strong we are you know the Americans are
02:18:13.660 afraid of us the Chinese are afraid of
02:18:14.888 his everybody's afraid of us the French
02:18:16.240 were afraid of us we are strong right
02:18:20.519 there's no question that Russia is going
02:18:24.308 to be interfering in elections
02:18:25.760 there's no question that America is
02:18:27.950 gonna be interfering in Russian
02:18:29.179 elections right and nobody nobody likes
02:18:30.650 to talk about this and again I need to
02:18:31.939 substantiate that now that I've said
02:18:33.439 that I've got an old note that I've
02:18:34.790 signed a billion times the New York
02:18:38.808 Times published a story in the wake of
02:18:41.808 you know this contestant 2016 election
02:18:43.910 where they looked into the history of
02:18:47.299 electoral interference in Russia and the
02:18:50.209 Soviet Union and they found in roughly
02:18:53.929 50 years 36 different cases of election
02:18:57.830 interference by Russia or the Soviets
02:18:59.599 right this is not a new thing this is
02:19:00.950 something that always happens because
02:19:02.150 that's what intelligence services do
02:19:04.218 that's what they think they're being
02:19:05.959 paid for which is a sad thing but it's a
02:19:08.269 it's a reality because we aren't wise
02:19:10.849 enough to separate covert action from
02:19:14.000 intelligence gathering but in that same
02:19:17.478 study that they found 36 different cases
02:19:20.228 by the Russians in the Soviets they
02:19:22.280 found 81 different cases by the US and
02:19:26.209 this was published by a Scott chain in
02:19:27.888 the New York Times and both the
02:19:29.570 Washington Post as well but this is this
02:19:32.420 is the thing like there is a way to
02:19:36.019 criticize the Russian government's
02:19:37.580 policies without criticizing the Russian
02:19:41.540 people who are ordinary people who just
02:19:45.200 want to have a happy life they just want
02:19:46.939 to do better they want the same things
02:19:48.080 that you do right and every time people
02:19:50.180 go all Russia Russia Russia every time
02:19:52.160 people go Russia bad every time they go
02:19:53.780 Russia's doing this they go Russia's
02:19:55.130 doing that Russian people who have
02:19:57.560 nothing to do with the government feel
02:19:59.000 implicated by that like do you feel like
02:20:02.780 you're in charge of Donald Trump like do
02:20:04.580 you want to be have Donald Trump's
02:20:06.860 legacy around your neck and then people
02:20:09.770 go oh well you know you could overthrow
02:20:11.420 Donald Trump you know you could
02:20:12.770 overthrow Putin can you really like is
02:20:14.720 that how it works so yeah I mean look I
02:20:19.070 have no affiliation I have no love for
02:20:22.130 the Russian government it's not my
02:20:23.570 choice to be here and I've made it very
02:20:26.240 clear I would be happy to return home is
02:20:28.040 there any concern that they would deny
02:20:30.170 you visa I mean how how are you staying
02:20:33.530 there it's it's a good question so I
02:20:36.229 have a permanent residence people think
02:20:38.090 I'm on our side
02:20:38.830 no longer it's like a green card now
02:20:41.370 it's got to be renewed every three years
02:20:43.800 so yeah sure it's possible they could
02:20:46.061 kick me out and this was what the story
02:20:47.440 I was telling you about before in
02:20:48.850 Russian media was they were saying you
02:20:50.561 know the Russian government should take
02:20:51.730 some action against me or shouldn't be
02:20:53.950 welcome here or I should go home because
02:20:56.350 why is he criticizing the Russian
02:20:58.271 government right when they're the people
02:20:59.890 is that like the Russian version of Fox
02:21:01.780 News I don't know enough about Russian
02:21:06.160 media to tell you I think it's supposed
02:21:08.740 to be more like a Reuters or Associated
02:21:10.420 Press but the hell if I know but the the
02:21:15.670 the thing is this what's the alternative
02:21:20.100 right yes the Russian government could
02:21:23.680 screw me but they could screw me even if
02:21:26.771 I didn't say anything and so should I
02:21:29.230 shut up and be quiet in the face of
02:21:31.570 things that I think are in Justices
02:21:34.080 because it makes me safer well a lot of
02:21:37.420 pragmatic people will say yeah they say
02:21:39.370 you've done enough they saying you've
02:21:40.570 done your part you know they say
02:21:42.070 whatever be safe live long be happy but
02:21:47.021 I didn't come forward to be safe if I
02:21:48.700 wanted to be safe I'd still be sitting
02:21:50.230 in Hawaii making a hell of a lot of
02:21:52.330 money to spy on all of you right and
02:21:55.480 nobody ever would have known about this
02:21:56.860 the system would have gotten worse but
02:21:59.620 the system the world the future gets
02:22:03.280 worse every day that we don't do
02:22:06.010 something about every day that we stay
02:22:07.510 silent about all the injustice as we see
02:22:09.460 the world gets worse things get worse
02:22:11.740 and yeah it's risky yeah it's
02:22:13.870 uncomfortable but that's why we do it
02:22:16.720 because if we don't no one else will all
02:22:20.080 those years I was sitting hoping for
02:22:22.210 someone else to come forward and no one
02:22:24.280 did right that's because I was waiting
02:22:26.140 for a hero but there are no heroes right
02:22:29.500 there's only heroic decisions you are
02:22:31.420 never further than one decision away
02:22:33.400 from making a difference doesn't matter
02:22:35.380 where there's a big difference doesn't
02:22:36.250 matter if it was a small difference
02:22:37.600 because you don't have to save the world
02:22:39.280 by yourself in fact you can't all you
02:22:43.390 have to do is lay down one brick right
02:22:45.730 all you have to do is make things a
02:22:47.200 little bit better in a small way so
02:22:50.160 other people can lay their brick on top
02:22:51.570 of that or beside and together step by
02:22:55.290 step day by day year by year we build
02:22:57.601 the foundation of something better but
02:23:00.450 yeah it's not gonna be safe but it
02:23:03.000 doesn't matter because individually it's
02:23:06.720 it's not you know me whoever you are
02:23:11.880 that's the Ironman well I don't care if
02:23:14.550 you're the biggest doomsday prepper with
02:23:16.380 cans full of beans if the world ends
02:23:19.351 it's going to affect you we make things
02:23:22.290 better we become safe together right
02:23:25.590 collectively that is our strength that
02:23:27.360 is the power of civilization that is the
02:23:29.070 power that shapes the future because
02:23:31.410 even if you make life great for you
02:23:32.851 you're gonna die someday you're gonna be
02:23:35.790 forgotten someday your cans of beans are
02:23:39.360 gonna rot someday you can make things
02:23:42.000 safe or you can be more careful right
02:23:46.710 you can be more clever and there's
02:23:48.240 nothing wrong with that but at the end
02:23:50.400 of the day you have to recognize if
02:23:52.050 you're trying to eliminate all risks
02:23:54.000 from your life what you're actually
02:23:55.860 doing is eliminating all possibility
02:23:58.710 from your life you you're trying to
02:24:00.570 collapse the universe of outcomes such
02:24:04.680 that what you've lost is freedom you've
02:24:07.260 lost the ability to act because you were
02:24:09.120 afraid
02:24:09.660 that's a beautiful into this mess that's
02:24:11.910 a beautiful way to put it are you aware
02:24:14.730 at all of the current state of
02:24:17.030 surveillance and what if anything has
02:24:19.680 changed since your revelations yeah I
02:24:23.490 mean the big thing that's changed since
02:24:26.630 I was in 2013 is now it's mobile first
02:24:32.760 everything mobile was still a big deal
02:24:37.530 right and the intelligence community was
02:24:40.561 very much grappling to get its hands
02:24:43.830 around it and to deal with it but now
02:24:46.650 people are much less likely to use
02:24:48.420 laptop then use a desktop than then use
02:24:51.510 you know God any kind of wired phone
02:24:54.351 then they are to use a smart phone and
02:24:57.870 both Apple and Android devices
02:25:00.230 unfortunately
02:25:01.979 are not especially good in protecting
02:25:05.310 your privacy think right now you got a
02:25:10.440 smartphone right you might be listening
02:25:12.000 to this on a train somewhere and in
02:25:14.760 traffic right now or you Joe right now
02:25:17.820 you got a phone somewhere in the room
02:25:19.320 right the phone is turned off or at
02:25:23.640 least the screen is turned off it's
02:25:25.320 sitting there it's powered on and if
02:25:28.800 somebody sends you a message the screen
02:25:30.750 blinks to life how does that happen but
02:25:36.440 how is it that if someone from any
02:25:38.970 corner of the earth dials a number your
02:25:41.100 phone rings and nobody else's rings how
02:25:43.350 is it you can dial anybody else's number
02:25:44.910 and only their phone rings right every
02:25:47.670 smartphone every phone at all is
02:25:50.880 constantly connected to the nearest
02:25:53.160 cellular tower every phone even when the
02:25:56.130 screen is off you think it's doing
02:25:57.960 nothing you can't see it because radio
02:25:59.580 frequency emissions are invisible it's
02:26:02.760 screaming in the air saying Here I am
02:26:05.220 Here I am
02:26:06.830 here is my IMEI I think it's an
02:26:10.560 individual manufacturers Equipment
02:26:12.810 Identity and IMEI individual
02:26:16.860 manufacturers subscriber identity I
02:26:19.920 could be wrong on the break out there
02:26:22.140 but the the acronyms are the IMEI and
02:26:24.780 the IMSI and you can search for these
02:26:27.030 things there are two globally unique
02:26:28.740 identifiers that only exist anywhere in
02:26:32.220 the world in one place right this makes
02:26:35.580 your phone different than all my other
02:26:36.660 phones the IMEI is burned into the hand
02:26:39.930 side of your phone no matter what SIM
02:26:41.550 card you changed to it's always gonna be
02:26:44.220 the same and it's always gonna be
02:26:45.390 telling the phone network it's this
02:26:46.710 physical handset the IME si
02:26:50.130 is in your SIM card right and this is
02:26:53.070 what holds your phone number right it's
02:26:54.479 the basically the key the right to use
02:26:56.190 that phone number and so your phone is
02:26:58.650 sitting there doing nothing you think
02:27:00.810 but it's constantly shouting and saying
02:27:03.120 I'm here who is closest to me that's a
02:27:06.180 cell phone tower and every cell phone
02:27:08.790 tower with its big ears is listening for
02:27:11.910 these little cries for help and going
02:27:14.190 alright
02:27:15.140 I see Joe Rogan's phone right I see
02:27:17.540 Jaime's phone I see all these phones
02:27:19.790 they're here right now
02:27:21.650 and it compares notes with the other
02:27:26.230 Network towers and your smartphone
02:27:28.610 compares notes with them to go who do I
02:27:30.920 hear the loudest and who you hear the
02:27:34.970 loudest is a proxy for proximity for
02:27:38.480 closeness distance right they go whoever
02:27:41.150 I hear more loudly than anybody else
02:27:43.160 that's close to me so you're gonna be
02:27:45.080 bound to this cell phone tower and that
02:27:46.640 cell phone tower is gonna make a note a
02:27:48.320 permanent record saying this phone this
02:27:53.300 phone handset with this phone number at
02:27:56.630 this time was connected to me right and
02:27:59.660 based on your phone handset and your
02:28:01.790 phone number they can get your identity
02:28:04.880 right because you pay for this stuff
02:28:07.700 with your credit card and everything
02:28:08.660 like that and even if you don't right
02:28:11.690 it's still active at your house
02:28:13.510 overnight it's still active you know on
02:28:15.740 your nightstand when you're sleeping
02:28:16.880 it's still whatever the movements of
02:28:20.271 your phone are the movements of you as a
02:28:21.710 person and those are often quite ly
02:28:24.230 uniquely identifying it goes to your
02:28:26.360 home it goes to your workplace other
02:28:28.490 people don't have it sorry
02:28:31.840 and anyway it's constantly shouting this
02:28:34.130 out and then it compares notes with the
02:28:35.300 other parts and network and when
02:28:37.610 somebody is trying to get to a phone it
02:28:39.950 compares notes of the network compares
02:28:42.140 notes to go where is this phone with
02:28:44.271 this phone number in the world right now
02:28:47.120 and to that cell phone tower that is
02:28:50.240 closest to that phone it sends out a
02:28:52.490 signal saying we have a call for you
02:28:54.830 make your phones start ringing so your
02:28:57.350 owner can answer it and then it connects
02:28:59.300 it across this whole path but what this
02:29:00.680 means is that whenever you're carrying a
02:29:02.900 phone ever the phone is turned on
02:29:04.480 there's a record of your presence at
02:29:07.280 that place that is being made and
02:29:09.110 created by companies it does not need to
02:29:12.170 be kept forever and as fact there's no
02:29:14.030 good argument for it to be kept forever
02:29:15.561 but these companies see that is valuable
02:29:17.870 information Ryan this is the whole big
02:29:20.000 data problem that we're running into and
02:29:21.590 all this information that used to be
02:29:23.870 ephemeral right where were you when you
02:29:25.970 were 8 years old you know
02:29:27.569 we're worried where'd you go after you
02:29:29.640 had a bad breakup you know who'd you
02:29:31.620 spend the night with who'd you call
02:29:32.670 after all this information used to be
02:29:34.830 ephemeral meaning it disappeared right
02:29:37.380 like like the morning dew it would be
02:29:39.149 gone no one would remember it but now
02:29:41.520 these things are stored now these things
02:29:43.979 are saved it doesn't matter whether
02:29:45.540 you're doing anything wrong it doesn't
02:29:47.040 matter whether you're the most ordinary
02:29:48.270 person on earth because that's how bulk
02:29:52.109 collection which is the government's
02:29:54.029 euphemism for mass surveillance works
02:29:56.460 they simply collected all in advance in
02:29:58.859 hopes that one day it will become useful
02:30:00.569 and that was just talking about how you
02:30:05.220 connected phone network that's not
02:30:07.200 talking about all those apps on your
02:30:08.880 phone that are contacting the network
02:30:11.310 even more frequently right how do you
02:30:15.390 get a text message notification how do
02:30:16.859 you get an email notification how is it
02:30:18.930 the Facebook knows where you're at you
02:30:20.609 know all of these things these analytics
02:30:24.200 they are trying to keep track through
02:30:26.399 location services on your phone to GPS
02:30:28.350 through even just what wireless access
02:30:30.479 points you're connected to because
02:30:32.069 there's a global constantly updated map
02:30:34.170 there's actually many of them of
02:30:35.460 wireless access points in the world
02:30:37.470 because just like we talked about every
02:30:38.910 phone has a unique identifier that's
02:30:40.500 globally unique every wireless access
02:30:42.750 point in the world right you cable modem
02:30:45.240 at home
02:30:46.319 whether it's in your laptop every device
02:30:48.029 that has a radio modem has a globally
02:30:50.850 unique identifier in it and this is
02:30:55.529 standard term you can look it up and
02:30:57.600 these things can be mapped when they're
02:30:59.729 broadcasting in the air because again
02:31:01.890 like your phone says to the cell phone
02:31:03.930 tower I have this identifier the cell
02:31:06.720 phone tower responds and says I have
02:31:08.670 this identifier and anybody who's
02:31:09.960 listening they can write these things
02:31:12.330 down and all there's Google Street View
02:31:14.430 cars that go back and forth right
02:31:16.260 they're keeping notes on whose Wi-Fi is
02:31:20.160 active on this block right and then they
02:31:22.770 build a new giant map so even if you
02:31:24.660 have GPS turned off right as long as you
02:31:27.540 connect to the Wi-Fi those apps can go
02:31:30.870 well I I'm connected to Joe's Wi-Fi but
02:31:34.200 I can also see his neighbor's Wi-Fi here
02:31:36.330 and the other one in this apartment over
02:31:38.100 here and the other one in the apartment
02:31:39.090 here
02:31:40.229 and you should only be able to hear
02:31:42.859 those four globally unique Wi-Fi access
02:31:46.260 points from these points in physical
02:31:49.260 space right the intersection in between
02:31:51.689 the spreads the domes of all those
02:31:54.499 wireless access points it's a proxy for
02:31:56.909 location and it just goes on and on and
02:31:59.369 on we could talk about this for four
02:32:00.390 more hours we don't have that kind of
02:32:01.560 time
02:32:01.890 can I ask you this is there a way to
02:32:03.539 mitigate any of this personally I mean
02:32:05.789 is shutting your phone off doesn't even
02:32:08.550 work right well so it does in a way it's
02:32:12.689 just no uhm the thing was shutting your
02:32:14.340 phone off that is a risk is how do you
02:32:16.319 know any phones actually turned off it
02:32:19.260 used to be when I was in Geneva for
02:32:21.840 example working for the CIA we would all
02:32:26.670 carry like drug dealer phones you know
02:32:29.970 the old smart phones there sorry old
02:32:32.640 dumb phones they're not smart phones and
02:32:35.100 the reason why was just because they had
02:32:37.550 removable battery bags where you could
02:32:40.109 take the battery out right and the one
02:32:42.899 beautiful thing about technology is if
02:32:44.909 there's no electricity in it right if
02:32:46.649 there's no go juice available to it if
02:32:49.590 there's no battery connected to it it's
02:32:51.449 not sending anything because you have to
02:32:53.010 get power from somewhere you have to
02:32:54.600 have power in order to do work but now
02:32:59.399 your phones are all sealed right you
02:33:01.020 can't take the batteries out so there
02:33:03.569 are potential ways that you can hack a
02:33:05.819 phone where it appears to be off but
02:33:07.529 it's not actually off it's just
02:33:09.359 pretending to be off whereas in fact
02:33:11.010 it's still listening in and doing all
02:33:12.479 this stuff but for the average person
02:33:14.659 that doesn't apply right and I got to
02:33:17.460 tell you guys they've been chasing me
02:33:19.289 all over the place I don't worry about
02:33:21.569 that stuff right and it's because if
02:33:24.779 they are applying that level of effort
02:33:26.279 to me they'll probably get the same
02:33:28.859 information through other routes I am as
02:33:32.069 careful as I can and I use things like
02:33:34.560 Faraday cages I turn devices off but if
02:33:36.930 they're actually manipulating the way
02:33:40.079 devices display it's just too great a
02:33:43.109 level of effort even for someone like me
02:33:44.729 to keep that up on a constant basis also
02:33:47.149 if they get me I only trust phones so
02:33:50.909 much so there's only so much they can
02:33:52.680 derive from
02:33:53.471 compromise and this is how operational
02:33:55.451 security works you think about what are
02:33:58.900 the realistic threats that you're facing
02:34:00.490 that you're trying to mitigate and with
02:34:03.551 the mitigation that you're trying to do
02:34:05.351 is what would be the loss what would be
02:34:08.110 the damage done to you if this stuff was
02:34:11.171 exploited much more realistic than
02:34:13.961 worrying about these things that I call
02:34:15.551 voodoo hacks right which are like
02:34:17.141 next-level stuff and actually just a
02:34:19.391 shout out for those of your readers who
02:34:21.671 are interested in this stuff fun I wrote
02:34:24.280 a paper on this specific problem how do
02:34:26.951 you know when a phone is actually off
02:34:28.511 how do you know when it's actually not
02:34:29.801 spying on you with a brilliant brilliant
02:34:32.740 guy named Andrew bunny Huang he's an MIT
02:34:35.951 PhD and I think electrical engineering
02:34:39.990 called the introspection engine that was
02:34:43.570 published in the Journal of hope and
02:34:45.161 engineering you can find it online and
02:34:48.280 it'll go as deep down in the weeds I
02:34:50.081 promise you it as you want we take an
02:34:51.851 iPhone 6 this was back when it was
02:34:54.671 fairly new and we modified it so we
02:34:57.011 could actually not trust the device to
02:35:00.311 report its own state but physically
02:35:01.871 monitor its state to see if were spying
02:35:03.190 on you but for average people right this
02:35:06.251 academic that's not your primary thread
02:35:10.061 your primary threats are these bulk
02:35:12.371 collection programs your primary threat
02:35:14.831 is the fact that your phone is
02:35:16.811 constantly squawking to these cell phone
02:35:18.940 towers it's doing all of these things
02:35:20.261 because we leave our phones a mistake
02:35:22.480 that is constantly on your constantly
02:35:25.240 connected right airplane mode doesn't
02:35:27.911 even turn off Wi-Fi really anymore it
02:35:30.161 just turns off the cellular modem but
02:35:33.461 the whole idea is we need to identify
02:35:36.461 the problem and the central problem with
02:35:39.311 smart phone use today is you have no
02:35:41.831 idea what the hell it's doing at any
02:35:43.331 given time like the phone has the screen
02:35:45.251 off you don't know what it's connected
02:35:46.780 to you don't know how frequently it's
02:35:48.280 doing it Apple and iOS unfortunately
02:35:51.431 makes it impossible to see what kind of
02:35:53.530 network connections are constantly made
02:35:55.331 on the device and to inter mediate them
02:35:57.251 going I don't want Facebook to be able
02:35:59.351 to talk right now you know I don't want
02:36:00.911 Google to be able to talk right now
02:36:02.501 I just want my secure messenger app to
02:36:05.501 be
02:36:05.730 the talk I just want my weather app to
02:36:08.280 be able to talk but I just checked my
02:36:09.870 weather and now I'm done with it so I
02:36:12.091 don't want that to be able to talk
02:36:13.290 anymore and we need to be able to make
02:36:15.061 these intelligent decisions on not just
02:36:18.240 an app by app basis but a connection by
02:36:20.280 connection basis right you want let's
02:36:23.221 say you use Facebook because you know
02:36:26.391 for whatever judgment we have a lot of
02:36:28.471 people might do it you want it to be
02:36:31.440 able to connect to Facebook's content
02:36:33.421 servers you want to be able to message a
02:36:36.030 friend you want to be able to download a
02:36:37.530 photograph or whatever but you don't
02:36:39.480 want it to be able to talk to an ad
02:36:40.561 server you don't want it to talk to an
02:36:42.480 analytics server that it's monitoring
02:36:44.190 your behavior right you don't want to
02:36:45.570 talk to all these third-party things
02:36:46.921 because Facebook crams their garbage and
02:36:49.440 almost every app that you download and
02:36:51.421 you don't even know what's happening
02:36:52.801 because you can't see it right and this
02:36:55.080 is the problem with the data collection
02:36:56.551 used today is there is an industry that
02:37:00.240 is built on keeping this invisible and
02:37:03.000 what we need to do is we need to make
02:37:04.860 the activities of our devices whether
02:37:08.610 it's a phone whether it's computer or
02:37:09.931 whatever more visible and understandable
02:37:13.141 to the average person and then give them
02:37:15.301 control over it so like if you could see
02:37:17.190 your phone right now and at the very
02:37:19.530 center of is a little green icon that's
02:37:21.240 your you know handset or it's a picture
02:37:23.761 your face whatever and then you see all
02:37:26.131 these little spokes coming off of it
02:37:28.261 that's every app that your phone is
02:37:30.391 talking to right now or every app that
02:37:33.570 is active on your phone right now and
02:37:34.950 all the hosts that it's connecting to
02:37:36.841 and you can see right now what's every
02:37:39.450 three seconds your phone is checking
02:37:41.641 into Facebook and you could just poke
02:37:43.921 that app and then BOOM it's not talking
02:37:46.110 to Facebook anymore Facebook's not
02:37:47.190 allowed Facebook speaking privileges
02:37:48.931 have been revoked right you would do
02:37:51.601 that we would all do that if there was a
02:37:53.730 button on your phone that said do what I
02:37:56.551 want but not spy on me you would press
02:37:59.011 that button right that button is not a
02:38:02.250 does not exist right now and both Google
02:38:05.070 and Apple
02:38:05.700 unfortunately Apple's a lot better at
02:38:07.080 this than Google but neither of them
02:38:11.240 allow that button to exist in fact they
02:38:14.131 actively interfere with it because they
02:38:15.690 say it's a security risk and from a
02:38:18.091 particular perspective
02:38:19.210 they actually aren't wrong there but
02:38:21.819 it's not enough to go you know we have
02:38:24.670 to lock that capability off from people
02:38:26.560 because we don't trust they would make
02:38:28.210 the right decisions we think it's too
02:38:29.979 complicated for people to do this we
02:38:31.840 think there's too many connections being
02:38:33.460 made well that is actually a confession
02:38:36.609 of the problem right there if you think
02:38:39.130 people can't understand it if you think
02:38:41.170 there are too many communications
02:38:42.609 happening if you think there's too much
02:38:43.660 complexity in there it needs to be
02:38:45.970 simplified
02:38:46.720 just like the president can't control
02:38:49.090 everything like that if you have to be
02:38:50.560 the president of the phone and the phone
02:38:52.239 is as complex as the United States
02:38:53.590 government we have a problem guys this
02:38:56.500 should be a much more simple process it
02:38:58.420 should be obvious and the fact that it's
02:39:00.370 not and the fact that we read story
02:39:02.229 after story
02:39:03.100 year after year saying all your date has
02:39:04.960 been breached here this companies spying
02:39:07.449 on you here this companies manipulating
02:39:09.580 your purchases or your search results or
02:39:12.220 they're hiding these things from your
02:39:14.350 timeline or they're influencing your you
02:39:17.470 are manipulating it in all of these
02:39:18.790 different ways that happens as a result
02:39:22.660 of a single problem and that problem is
02:39:27.430 in any quality of available information
02:39:30.600 they can see everything about you they
02:39:33.069 can see everything about what your
02:39:34.149 device is doing and they can do whatever
02:39:35.350 they want with your device you on the
02:39:37.300 other hand owns the device well rather
02:39:40.660 you paid for the device but increasingly
02:39:43.989 these corporations on it increasingly
02:39:46.180 these government's own it and
02:39:47.560 increasingly we are living in a world
02:39:48.790 where we do all the work right we pay
02:39:52.390 all the taxes we pay all the costs but
02:39:56.350 we own less and less and nobody
02:39:59.380 understands this better than the
02:40:00.520 youngest generation well it seems like
02:40:02.229 our data became a commodity before we
02:40:04.750 understood what it was it became this
02:40:07.359 thing that's insanely valuable to Google
02:40:09.939 and Facebook and all these social media
02:40:11.710 platforms before we understood what we
02:40:14.260 were giving up they were making billions
02:40:15.970 of dollars and then once that money is
02:40:19.149 being earned and once everyone's
02:40:20.770 accustomed to this situation
02:40:22.300 it's very difficult to pull the reins
02:40:24.100 back it's very difficult to turn that
02:40:25.779 horse around
02:40:27.210 precisely because the money then becomes
02:40:29.470 pot right right the information that
02:40:31.479 becomes influence
02:40:32.591 that also seems to be the same sort of
02:40:34.120 situation that would happen with these
02:40:35.501 mass surveillance dates once they have
02:40:37.690 the access it's going to be incredibly
02:40:40.120 difficult for them to relinquish that
02:40:42.811 right yeah no you're you're exactly
02:40:45.700 correct and this is the the subject of
02:40:47.711 the book I mean this is this is the
02:40:49.271 permanent record and this is where it
02:40:50.591 came from this is how it came to exist
02:40:53.370 the story of our lifetimes is how
02:40:58.051 intentionally by design a number of
02:41:02.320 institutions both governmental and
02:41:04.990 corporate realized it was in their
02:41:07.120 mutual interest to conceal their data
02:41:10.301 collection activities to increase the
02:41:14.051 breadth and depth of their sensor
02:41:16.511 networks that were sort of spread out
02:41:18.370 through society remember back in the day
02:41:20.591 intelligence collection in the United
02:41:23.200 States even at Sigyn used to mean
02:41:24.940 sending an FBI agent right to put
02:41:27.730 alligator clips on an embassy building
02:41:29.440 or sending in somebody disguised as a
02:41:32.530 workman and they put a bug in a building
02:41:35.650 or they built a satellite listening site
02:41:39.341 right we called these foreign said were
02:41:41.110 foreign satellite collection we're on
02:41:44.080 the desert somewhere they built a big
02:41:46.171 parabolic collector and it's just
02:41:49.240 listening to satellite emissions right
02:41:51.131 but these satellite emissions these
02:41:53.801 satellite links were owned by militaries
02:41:56.740 they were exclusive to governments right
02:41:58.660 it wasn't affecting everybody broadly
02:42:01.181 all surveillance was targeted because it
02:42:04.001 had to be what changed with technology
02:42:07.330 is that surveillance could now become
02:42:10.021 indiscriminate it could become dragnet
02:42:12.820 it could become bulk collection which
02:42:15.971 should become one of the dirtiest
02:42:17.230 phrases in the language if we have any
02:42:19.811 kind of decency but we were
02:42:22.200 intentionally this was intentionally
02:42:26.171 concealed from us right the government
02:42:28.301 did it they used classification
02:42:30.091 companies did it they intentionally
02:42:32.501 didn't talk about it they denied these
02:42:35.051 things were going they said you agreed
02:42:37.391 to this and you didn't greeted nothing
02:42:39.851 like this I'm sorry right they go we put
02:42:43.001 that Terms of Service page up and you
02:42:45.050 that you clicked a button that said I
02:42:47.539 agree because you were trying to open an
02:42:50.000 account so you could talk to your
02:42:51.770 friends you were trying to get driving
02:42:53.659 directions you were trying to get an
02:42:54.979 email account you weren't trying to
02:42:56.689 agree to some 600 page legal form that
02:42:59.810 even if you read you wouldn't understand
02:43:01.609 and it doesn't matter even if you did
02:43:03.409 understand because one of the very first
02:43:05.029 paragraphs and I said this agreement can
02:43:07.100 be changed at any time unilaterally
02:43:09.380 without your consent by the company
02:43:11.239 right they have built a legal paradigm
02:43:15.619 that presumes records collected about us
02:43:19.539 do not belong to us this is sort of one
02:43:24.649 of the core principles on which mass
02:43:26.119 surveillance from the government's
02:43:28.010 perspective in the United States is
02:43:29.270 legal and you have to understand that
02:43:31.250 all the stuff we talked about today
02:43:32.239 government says everything they do is
02:43:34.189 legal right and they go so it's fine our
02:43:37.310 perspectives the public should be well
02:43:39.560 that's actually the problem because this
02:43:41.659 isn't okay
02:43:42.289 the scandal isn't how they're breaking
02:43:44.689 the law the scandal is that they don't
02:43:46.819 have to break the law and the way they
02:43:49.850 say they're not breaking the law is
02:43:51.199 something called the third party
02:43:52.430 doctrine the third party doctrine is a
02:43:57.399 legal principle and derived from a case
02:44:00.050 and I believe the 1970s called Smith
02:44:02.600 versus Maryland and Smith was this
02:44:07.039 knucklehead who was harassing this lady
02:44:09.409 making phone calls to her house and when
02:44:13.100 she would pick up you just I don't know
02:44:14.840 is that their heavy breathing whatever
02:44:16.340 like a classic creeper and you know it
02:44:20.029 was terrifying this poor lady so she
02:44:22.550 calls the cops and says one day I got
02:44:25.789 one of these phone calls and then I see
02:44:27.229 this car
02:44:28.039 creeping past my house on the street and
02:44:30.710 she got a license-plate number so she
02:44:32.960 goes the cops and she goes is this the
02:44:34.640 guy and the cops again they're trying to
02:44:38.000 do a good thing here they look up his
02:44:41.510 license-plate number and they find out
02:44:44.510 where this guy is and then they go what
02:44:46.340 phone number is registered to that house
02:44:47.750 and they go to the phone company and
02:44:49.100 they say can you give us this record the
02:44:50.539 phone company says yeah sure and it's
02:44:53.210 the guy the cops got their man
02:44:55.420 right huh so they go arrest this guy and
02:44:58.210 then in court his lawyer brings all this
02:45:00.820 stuff up and they go um you did this
02:45:08.560 without a warrant that was sorry that
02:45:10.360 was that was the the problem was they
02:45:12.850 went to the phone company they got the
02:45:13.990 records without a warrant they just
02:45:15.220 asked for it or they subpoenaed it right
02:45:17.080 some lower standard of legal review and
02:45:19.060 the company gave it to him and got the
02:45:21.430 guy they march amok in jail and they
02:45:25.600 could have gotten a warrant right but it
02:45:27.310 was just expedience they just didn't
02:45:28.780 want to take the time with small-town
02:45:30.310 cops you can understand how it happens
02:45:32.410 they know the guy's a creep or they just
02:45:33.490 want to get him off to jail and so they
02:45:37.180 made him I said but the government
02:45:38.050 doesn't want to let go they fight on
02:45:39.580 this and they go it wasn't actually they
02:45:45.280 weren't his records and so because they
02:45:48.430 didn't belong to him he didn't have a
02:45:50.200 Fourth Amendment right to demand a
02:45:54.130 warrant be issued for them they were the
02:45:56.380 company's records and the company
02:45:58.030 provided them voluntarily and hence no
02:46:00.070 warrant was required because you can
02:46:01.750 give whatever you want without a warrant
02:46:03.340 as long as it's yours now here's the
02:46:05.560 problem the government extrapolated a
02:46:08.560 principle in a single case of a single
02:46:11.530 known suspected criminal who had they
02:46:14.260 had real good reasons suspect suspect
02:46:16.990 was their guy and used that to go to a
02:46:22.030 company and get records from them and
02:46:23.800 establish the precedent these records
02:46:26.020 don't belong to the guy they belong to
02:46:28.180 the company and then they said well if
02:46:30.130 one person doesn't have a Fourth
02:46:32.500 Amendment interest in records held by a
02:46:33.970 company no one does and so the company
02:46:37.630 then has absolute proprietary ownership
02:46:39.880 of all of these records about all of our
02:46:41.830 lives and remember this is back in the
02:46:43.210 1970s you know the internet hardly
02:46:45.910 exists in these kind of contexts
02:46:48.340 smartphones you know don't exist modern
02:46:50.590 society modern communications don't
02:46:53.050 exist this is the very beginning of the
02:46:55.330 technological era and flash-forward now
02:46:59.939 40 years
02:47:04.750 and they are still relying on this
02:47:07.270 precedent about this one
02:47:08.590 you know pervy creeper to go nobody has
02:47:11.500 a privacy right for anything that's held
02:47:13.090 by a company and so long as they do that
02:47:15.820 companies are going to be
02:47:17.080 extraordinarily powerful and they're
02:47:19.060 going to be extraordinarily abusive and
02:47:20.380 this is something that people don't get
02:47:21.520 they go oh well it's data collection
02:47:24.490 right they're exploiting data this is
02:47:27.010 data about human lives mistake about
02:47:31.000 people these records are about you it's
02:47:33.250 not data that's being exploited it's
02:47:37.060 people that are being exploited it's not
02:47:39.660 data that's being manipulated it's you
02:47:43.720 that's being manipulated and this this
02:47:48.130 is this is something that I think a lot
02:47:50.140 of people are beginning to understand
02:47:52.810 the problem is the companies in the
02:47:54.520 government's are still pretending they
02:47:55.660 don't understand were disagreeing with
02:47:57.400 this and this is reminds me of something
02:47:59.230 that one of my old friends John Perry
02:48:01.780 Barlow who served with me at the freedom
02:48:05.950 of the press foundation I'm the
02:48:07.360 president of the board he used to say to
02:48:10.540 me which is you can't awaken someone
02:48:14.920 who's pretending to be asleep he said
02:48:17.440 it's an old Native American saying
02:48:18.790 that's a great expression it's a good
02:48:21.760 way that I think that's a good way to
02:48:23.410 end this thank you very much for doing
02:48:26.380 this I really appreciate it please tell
02:48:28.060 everybody the title of your book and
02:48:29.950 it's it's available right now
02:48:31.800 sure yes it is it's on shelves
02:48:34.390 everywhere at least until the government
02:48:36.040 finds some other way to ban it it is
02:48:38.350 called a permanent record and I hope
02:48:42.400 you'll read it I will read it and I
02:48:44.620 think what you've done is incredibly
02:48:46.750 brave and I think you're a very
02:48:47.980 important part of history I think when
02:48:50.680 all is said and done what you did and
02:48:53.500 what you exposed is gonna change the way
02:48:56.440 we view mass surveillance change the way
02:48:59.410 we view government oversight and it
02:49:01.900 changed the way we view the distribution
02:49:04.030 of information I really think it's very
02:49:05.950 very important and it was an honor to
02:49:08.410 talk to you man thank you
02:49:09.730 it was my pleasure thank you so much for
02:49:12.130 having take care yourself man stay safe
02:49:14.921 no no no no don't stay safe stay safe
02:49:17.980 open space days free open to
02:49:20.711 possibilities take care thank you
