00:00:01.959 Joe Rogan podcast check it out The Joe
00:00:04.440 Rogan Experience Train by day Joe Rogan
00:00:07.600 podcast by night all
00:00:11.719 day uh but but if you want to sort of
00:00:14.280 see like a vision of the future it's
00:00:16.560 like basically the the like the top 20
00:00:18.960 and even the top 100 is like totally
00:00:21.000 dominated by China it's yeah this is
00:00:23.560 like China and a little bit of Korea and
00:00:25.519 Taiwan so you in are you in the top 20
00:00:27.560 in the world or top 20 wow in DIA
00:00:30.880 yeah yeah do you want to tell everybody
00:00:32.279 your handle no no don't tell them don't
00:00:35.239 tell them it's not worth it well they
00:00:37.760 they actually listed me with my actual
00:00:39.399 name in the in the list oh did they
00:00:41.680 really oh interesting um but um yeah
00:00:46.079 there's only there's only two Americans
00:00:47.280 in the top 20 uh the the rest almost
00:00:49.520 everyone is from Asia otherwise we were
00:00:51.960 talking about something that I think is
00:00:53.520 a really good because people always
00:00:54.800 think that video games are frivolous but
00:00:56.719 what what you were saying I think that's
00:00:57.960 really important is it it's so difficult
00:01:00.480 that it requires you to only think about
00:01:02.440 that and it can like relieve stress it
00:01:05.560 can take out the rest of the world cuz
00:01:07.280 it's so hard yeah you can only think
00:01:09.200 about that yeah I mean if finally if I
00:01:11.360 play a video game on Extreme difficulty
00:01:13.040 then um I have to concentrate fully on
00:01:15.040 the game um and it's it's has a calming
00:01:18.479 effect yeah uh it sort of chills down um
00:01:22.640 and uh I mean you mentioned I think many
00:01:24.799 people like if you play martial arts or
00:01:26.360 you play pool like something that that
00:01:28.400 forces you it's like I think any
00:01:30.119 anything that forces you to concentrate
00:01:32.520 fully um actually has a has a calming
00:01:36.040 effect I find it just sort of
00:01:38.280 like um kind of a mental a restoring
00:01:41.840 effect mentally it's like it's good
00:01:43.600 Jiu-Jitsu is like that archeries like
00:01:45.680 that as well like when you're shooting a
00:01:47.880 bow you have to is there's so many
00:01:49.799 moving things and you're trying you have
00:01:52.200 to think only of it and it cleans the
00:01:54.159 mind it cleans the mind yeah exactly I
00:01:55.719 was watch I was reading this study about
00:01:58.119 surgeons where they found that surgeons
00:02:00.560 who regularly play video games make less
00:02:02.880 errors well it's I mean video games
00:02:05.200 require manual dexterity so uh it makes
00:02:07.719 sense completely makes sense actually if
00:02:09.479 somebody was like epic at video games uh
00:02:12.120 i' I'd say like their surgical skill is
00:02:13.760 going to be very good because in order
00:02:14.959 to be good at video games any kind of
00:02:16.840 fast reaction video games look at this
00:02:18.680 32% fewer errors 24% faster and scored
00:02:23.040 26% better overall than their non-player
00:02:26.680 colleagues oh I believe that for sure
00:02:28.280 that's incredible you should be required
00:02:31.040 in medical school to play video games I
00:02:34.120 if somebody's like top a top ranked
00:02:35.800 video game player and they say they're a
00:02:37.160 surgeon I'd be like plus plus one plus
00:02:39.159 two type of thing oh top ranked for sure
00:02:41.280 but this isn't even top ranked this is
00:02:42.720 just people who play well your your
00:02:45.120 manual dexterity has to be extremely
00:02:46.519 high so you're you're looking at things
00:02:47.920 on the screen you've got you're reacting
00:02:49.480 and you some you got like 10
00:02:50.440 milliseconds to react yes um and um and
00:02:54.400 and so if somebody's got uh incredible
00:02:56.239 reaction times manual dexterity they're
00:02:58.040 obviously going to be a good surgeon
00:03:00.040 imagine if there was a course that you
00:03:01.640 could take that course would promote you
00:03:03.640 would be 26% better yeah everyone would
00:03:07.120 have to take that course sure why would
00:03:09.159 you want a surgeon that's less prepared
00:03:11.280 you would say hey Bob did you take this
00:03:12.720 course you didn't take this course don't
00:03:14.120 you understand this course makes you 26%
00:03:16.159 better sure you would have to take it
00:03:18.159 everyone should have to play video games
00:03:19.840 if you want to be a surgeon well I think
00:03:21.599 it' be it certainly would be a very good
00:03:23.000 test to see if somebody can't play video
00:03:25.120 games well like that means I me because
00:03:27.360 you got to move both hands
00:03:28.239 simultaneously you got to react
00:03:29.879 something very fast then um on the
00:03:32.159 screen so and and if if your keystrokes
00:03:35.920 or your mouse clicks or whatever are
00:03:37.280 wrong uh then you lose the game so if
00:03:41.159 somebody's like has a good rank in video
00:03:43.120 games I would say that they're manual de
00:03:45.159 necessarily their manual dexterity must
00:03:47.159 be very extremely good well it's so hard
00:03:49.239 motor skills have to be excellent if you
00:03:50.599 think about like Starcraft or any any
00:03:52.599 game like Quake any game where a lot of
00:03:54.879 people are playing to rise to the top
00:03:56.680 you have to be exceptional period as a
00:03:58.480 human being there's to be something
00:04:00.120 exceptional about you yeah actually
00:04:02.959 Quake way way back in the day I was one
00:04:04.560 of the world's best Quake players I know
00:04:06.439 we talked about this yeah um I loved
00:04:08.760 Quake yeah yeah I my final semester in
00:04:11.159 college I probably put more time into
00:04:12.480 Quake than all my college classes when I
00:04:14.519 was on news radio all of the writers
00:04:17.079 were super nerds they were very very fun
00:04:19.720 guys and they had a land set up at the
00:04:22.320 studio where they all played Quake I had
00:04:23.840 never played video games and I would go
00:04:25.600 in with the writers just kind of hang
00:04:26.960 out with them we'd get silly and then we
00:04:28.800 would would all start playing video
00:04:30.120 games and playing Quake against each
00:04:31.800 other and I got addicted like hardcore I
00:04:34.800 got a T1 line installed in my house I
00:04:37.240 went hardcore yeah exactly you're
00:04:39.039 checking how many milliseconds of
00:04:40.080 latency you oh yeah I was I was fully
00:04:42.759 addicted I was making my own computers I
00:04:45.039 was going to fries hardware and buying
00:04:47.880 motherboards and putting everything
00:04:49.560 together and you know it was too much of
00:04:52.639 a Time suck though I'm an obsessive
00:04:54.919 person I can't get involved like I can't
00:04:56.759 put golf no it's too golf is too slow
00:04:59.479 for I mean I know a lot of people find
00:05:00.880 golf good and I mean I guess if you
00:05:02.240 think of it like it's I guess if you're
00:05:04.160 saying you're going to walk outdoors
00:05:05.840 with friends and occasionally hit a ball
00:05:08.759 then and and you're just as an outdoor
00:05:10.600 walk then that's cool um and does
00:05:12.759 require concentration we hitting the
00:05:14.000 ball but it it's it's it's a it's this
00:05:16.960 too slow for me nothing compares to
00:05:18.600 video games in terms of like the amount
00:05:20.039 of feedback you get like the the the the
00:05:22.919 sensory overload you get when you're
00:05:25.120 looking at a large high resolution
00:05:27.000 screen you have a fast computer you have
00:05:29.240 headphones on that you're hearing sounds
00:05:31.680 from here and sounds behind you and
00:05:33.440 Rockets are flying by you and it's
00:05:36.400 there's nothing like that yeah but I
00:05:38.280 think golf still is like Jamie will tell
00:05:40.520 you Jam's an addict he's a Golf Nut it's
00:05:43.880 super addictive and it takes like eight
00:05:46.199 hours a day it's yes uh once you get
00:05:49.440 into golf I think I guess any sport it
00:05:51.639 gets super predictive um so but but for
00:05:55.319 me the the int the intensity of video
00:05:57.800 games is uh hard to beat yes it's and
00:06:01.880 the people dismiss it because they think
00:06:03.479 it's just a waste of time but we're
00:06:05.000 showing like real world benefits so
00:06:07.080 people playing video games yeah if you
00:06:08.639 want to be a drone operator it's the
00:06:09.880 only game in town yeah really good at
00:06:12.199 video games yeah um for sure so um in
00:06:16.039 fact I can actually tell U like what my
00:06:18.919 me mental acuity is uh if I just play if
00:06:21.960 I play a very hard video game so if I'm
00:06:23.440 trying to sort of get like a an
00:06:26.160 extremely good clear time in Diablo or
00:06:28.440 something like that um
00:06:30.400 or or any you know a post person
00:06:32.599 shootter whatever the case may be like
00:06:35.080 if I I can tell that I'm tired uh or my
00:06:39.199 brain's not working as well as it should
00:06:41.120 it's it's like a it's like a mental
00:06:42.400 calibration you can tell immediately
00:06:44.039 like what is what what how good is your
00:06:45.680 mental state right right um and
00:06:50.599 uh you know so it's like like if if
00:06:52.720 you're trying to play really well like I
00:06:54.160 If you play late at night and you're
00:06:55.199 tired you would just play badly right
00:06:57.080 and you can say okay you you may think
00:06:59.960 that your brain is working well but it
00:07:01.759 isn't because you can you play the video
00:07:03.720 game and you're like you suck so okay
00:07:05.440 yeah you're putting it under stress yeah
00:07:07.560 you're really stress testing it you
00:07:09.319 stress test it and uh cuz like sometimes
00:07:11.759 like oh I think I think I'm fine but
00:07:13.120 then you play the game like okay I'm not
00:07:14.800 I might I'm like 10% below what I should
00:07:16.879 be that's how I feel about workouts for
00:07:18.800 sure like that's how I knew I had Co or
00:07:20.840 I knew everyone in my family had Co and
00:07:23.240 I trying to not get covid and so I was
00:07:26.240 working out I was like something's up
00:07:28.360 like I felt fine nor but then during
00:07:30.560 exercise I was like okay I can tell
00:07:31.960 there's something wrong here so let's
00:07:33.879 back off relax yeah yeah it's like
00:07:37.520 people who don't stress test their mind
00:07:39.919 they think they're operating on the same
00:07:41.639 level all the time like sometimes I come
00:07:43.160 in here and I can't form a [ __ ] sense
00:07:46.360 and I don't know what it is it's like
00:07:48.080 what is going on so it's just like like
00:07:50.479 sleep's not maybe like what sleep wasn't
00:07:51.919 that good or something like that yeah
00:07:52.960 something like that or I'm too busy and
00:07:55.080 it's just it's not the words aren't
00:07:56.400 coming out like I know how to talk I
00:07:58.000 talk professionally and I can't [ __ ]
00:07:59.599 talk it's like I mean sleep's is is is
00:08:02.599 massive I mean like huge yeah so uh if I
00:08:06.240 can tell me Le did I get a good night
00:08:07.720 sleep or not if if I just play like uh
00:08:10.759 video game for like five minutes I'm
00:08:12.720 like okay my sleep wasn't that good um
00:08:14.440 because my my you know and then
00:08:16.319 sometimes they your brain will recover
00:08:18.319 through the day and it's like okay like
00:08:20.120 an hour or two after waking up it's
00:08:22.039 better uh CU your brain does kind of
00:08:24.240 recover from Bad nights sleep a little
00:08:26.599 bit during you know what it really helps
00:08:27.919 creatine apparently does it yeah
00:08:29.960 creatine is actually a neut Tropic
00:08:31.919 believe it or not there's a lot of like
00:08:33.399 benefits of creatine that are really
00:08:34.839 weird are there any downsides no no it's
00:08:37.839 natural part of food yeah yeah
00:08:39.399 especially women for for women
00:08:41.080 apparently especially postmenopausal
00:08:43.000 women it's very beneficial okay and uh
00:08:45.600 it there's but there's a lot of like
00:08:47.760 cognitive benefits and one of the big
00:08:49.560 ones that they found recently is
00:08:51.640 performance when sleep deprived mental
00:08:54.279 performance when sleep deprived
00:08:56.000 increases pretty measurably when you
00:08:58.200 supplement with creatine
00:09:00.160 is creatin naturally occurring in like
00:09:01.560 steak or yeah it's like naturally
00:09:03.360 occurring in meat I think I think that's
00:09:06.000 where it's coming from I think it's a
00:09:08.160 primarily an animal-based thing yeah but
00:09:11.800 like I I did switch to like steak and
00:09:13.839 eggs for breakfast and I found that's
00:09:15.399 like a PowerUp oh yeah yeah yeah well
00:09:18.120 we're all overrun with carbohydrates
00:09:20.560 yeah yeah totally and you like
00:09:21.920 carbohydrates make this big crash the
00:09:24.000 rise and the Crash the rise and the
00:09:25.560 Crash you stay flat if you eat like a a
00:09:28.720 primarily High high protein high fat
00:09:30.600 diet yeah your body runs off ketosis
00:09:33.279 essentially I mean so I just have like
00:09:35.279 steak and eggs no no bread or or
00:09:36.920 anything and it's great actually it's a
00:09:39.560 PowerUp I'd say people dismiss this
00:09:41.279 whole carnivore diet thing because in
00:09:43.040 our heads there's a lot of propagandist
00:09:45.200 that put this thing out there that
00:09:47.480 animal agriculture is the number one
00:09:50.360 contributor to global warming this
00:09:53.240 rubish not true [ __ ] it's hot
00:09:55.120 [ __ ] do matter not only is it hot
00:09:56.760 [ __ ] but the real problem is Factory
00:09:59.040 f
00:10:00.120 regenerative farming is carbon neutral
00:10:02.839 if doesn't sequester carbon the the the
00:10:05.079 animals are not going to make any
00:10:06.040 difference to global warming like none
00:10:08.760 Zer zero nothing do you think that
00:10:11.240 that's just propaganda because of people
00:10:13.120 that have a vested interest in like
00:10:14.600 plant-based meat products and things
00:10:16.480 along those lines green energy I think
00:10:19.000 it's part of it um you know that you're
00:10:22.160 generally going to get people pushing to
00:10:23.920 avoid me like some people just you know
00:10:26.600 um yeah maybe they got to financial
00:10:28.160 interest maybe they just just like
00:10:29.640 vegetarians or vegans or whatever um
00:10:31.480 ideological ideological reasons um but
00:10:34.440 uh it's not going to make any difference
00:10:36.519 uh to global warming or you know the CO2
00:10:39.440 concentration atmosphere really um if if
00:10:41.959 people eat fewer uh steaks it doesn't
00:10:44.000 matter it's relevant irrelevant I want
00:10:45.959 to be super clear about that yeah will
00:10:48.240 not matter you will not even be able to
00:10:49.920 measure it okay that's how irrelevant it
00:10:52.079 is isn't it funny that that's
00:10:54.600 unmeasurable heretic speaking like
00:10:57.240 that's crazy talk now nowadays it's like
00:10:59.720 you have to say that we have to eat less
00:11:01.800 meat that meat is bad totally eat as
00:11:04.480 much as you want it's not going to make
00:11:05.560 a difference sing it sing it to world
00:11:08.040 yeah absolutely um and if somebody says
00:11:10.160 it does make a difference I'm like how
00:11:11.320 will you measure it and if you can't
00:11:12.399 even measure it then it's [ __ ] yeah
00:11:14.639 yeah literally I won't be able to
00:11:15.600 measure it well there's so much [ __ ]
00:11:17.560 out today first of all [ __ ] all
00:11:19.519 directions thank you so much for buying
00:11:22.399 Twitter thank you so much I'm not
00:11:24.959 exaggerating when I think you changed
00:11:26.480 the course of history I really do I
00:11:28.839 really think you you made a fork in the
00:11:31.800 road we were headed down a path of
00:11:34.680 censorship and of control of narratives
00:11:39.440 that is unprecedented forget about what
00:11:41.560 they were able to do back when they had
00:11:43.320 newspapers and the media under control
00:11:46.639 the what they were doing with social
00:11:47.880 media by suppressing information and
00:11:50.200 when you had a combined government
00:11:52.000 effort like with the what they were
00:11:53.680 doing with the laptop story y you have
00:11:55.800 51 Former Intelligence agents saying
00:11:58.360 that this is Russ disinformation take it
00:12:01.000 off offline and Twitter complied yeah if
00:12:04.079 if you didn't buy that we wouldn't have
00:12:05.600 known that we had no idea exactly uh no
00:12:09.320 it's I mean the the reason I border was
00:12:11.800 because I'm pretty attuned um since I I
00:12:14.000 was like the most interacted with a user
00:12:16.680 on Twitter before the acquisition so
00:12:19.279 before the acquisition I had more
00:12:20.560 interactions that than like there's some
00:12:22.560 accounts like Obama and whatever had
00:12:23.880 higher follower accounts uh but uh I had
00:12:26.440 the most number of interactions of of
00:12:28.320 any account in the system
00:12:29.760 so um I was very attuned to like if if
00:12:32.839 they saw change if they change the
00:12:34.079 system I can tell immediately like and
00:12:36.160 I'm like I'm like something weird is
00:12:37.800 going on here you know like so there's
00:12:39.959 like I I just got increasingly uneasy um
00:12:43.639 and obviously when when they deplatform
00:12:45.440 to sitting president you know not deep
00:12:47.560 de deep platform Trump uh that was that
00:12:50.240 was just insane um you know um and and
00:12:53.920 and the things he was posting like he
00:12:55.399 was posting things that that like he was
00:12:57.800 posting good things he was saying like
00:12:58.959 hey
00:12:59.800 we don't do not Riot don't don't do any
00:13:03.240 destruction of property you know please
00:13:05.360 stay calm like that's the kind of stuff
00:13:07.240 was posting yeah and you're like uh
00:13:10.320 what's wrong with that that's and and
00:13:12.000 then then then some people say like oh
00:13:13.639 that's like some sort of dog whistle he
00:13:14.839 means the opposite I'm like okay so
00:13:16.760 we'll give you Trump's account now you
00:13:18.440 you post what you think he should post
00:13:20.519 because he can post nothing he can ask
00:13:22.120 people to calm
00:13:23.600 down like what it was insane like it
00:13:27.000 didn't make any sense well it's
00:13:28.519 completely a l local when you say it's
00:13:30.079 dog whistling to tell his followers to
00:13:33.120 not be violent that's crazy crazy that's
00:13:35.720 crazy don't you think they'll listen to
00:13:37.880 him yeah isn't that the whole point they
00:13:39.639 listened to him and created violence in
00:13:41.120 the first place that's what you think
00:13:42.720 that's what you're you're accusing him
00:13:44.399 of right and then there's the fact that
00:13:46.959 we know that there was agents in the
00:13:48.880 crowd that were agent provocators that
00:13:50.800 were encouraging people to do illegal
00:13:52.800 [ __ ] we know that for a fact this is not
00:13:55.680 that was always the big Alex Jones type
00:13:58.560 10 hat conspiracy theory cuz Alex
00:14:01.440 proposed that back at the World Trade
00:14:03.680 Organization protests I believe we in
00:14:06.079 Seattle in the 90s and they sent in
00:14:09.240 agent provocator started smashing things
00:14:11.320 lighting things on fire now all a sudden
00:14:13.120 a peaceful protest is no longer peaceful
00:14:15.480 they move in the cops they shut
00:14:16.920 everything down they had it set up where
00:14:19.120 it was a no protest Zone where you
00:14:21.279 couldn't even have a pin that had the
00:14:23.079 WTO with a red line through it they
00:14:24.720 wouldn't let you go in through to go to
00:14:26.240 work so you couldn't prot you couldn't
00:14:28.519 exercise your first amendment rights you
00:14:31.000 couldn't even like have a peaceful
00:14:32.680 protest a [ __ ] sticker on your car
00:14:34.680 you couldn't have that it's crazy it is
00:14:37.360 crazy so no I think we're we we're very
00:14:40.120 much at a folk in the road in uh Destiny
00:14:42.600 um and um you know so I I mean the
00:14:47.240 reason I yeah did the Twitter
00:14:48.839 acquisition was like it's like man if I
00:14:50.399 don't do this I think we're screwed is
00:14:52.199 the issue well you didn't do it no one
00:14:53.839 else was going to do it because it
00:14:54.959 wasn't a financial winner it was kind of
00:14:57.279 a crazy move it's a crazy move I mean
00:14:59.680 the the thing was way overpriced um and
00:15:03.639 um you know like long term I think uh we
00:15:06.320 can we can ultimately make it a win for
00:15:08.199 investors but boy this is this is a this
00:15:11.079 is a hard way to make a living well
00:15:12.880 there's also a concerted effort to
00:15:14.160 suppress it there's a concered effort
00:15:16.120 with the advertisers well we we we had a
00:15:18.600 and still have um a massive Advertiser
00:15:21.240 boycott that was organized by a bunch of
00:15:23.720 leftwing NGS like uh you know and and
00:15:26.519 you always want and I should have I
00:15:28.600 should have brought my uh I I have a hat
00:15:31.240 make all well fiction again I've seen
00:15:33.399 that hat yeah I I should have I was
00:15:36.279 going toar I should have bought my make
00:15:38.279 oil fiction had to um but but uh yeah I
00:15:42.079 mean it's just totally totally nuts um
00:15:45.279 so if you didn't do it no one would have
00:15:47.839 and here's the hilarious narrative that
00:15:49.480 I keep hearing from idiots uh elon's a
00:15:52.399 bad business man Twitter is worth you
00:15:54.639 know 400% less than when he bought it no
00:15:57.440 it wasn't worth that in the first place
00:15:59.000 it wasn't worth that in the first place
00:15:59.959 it wasn't worth $44 billion you [ __ ]
00:16:01.880 morons like wrong and also you're not
00:16:04.440 taking into account The Advertiser
00:16:05.920 boycott exact that's total [ __ ] yeah
00:16:08.759 exactly so there are these organizations
00:16:11.240 like you can tell there's like they're
00:16:12.519 like like when they have an ellian name
00:16:15.519 so like the like the C Center for
00:16:17.199 countering digital hate is is a total
00:16:19.399 scam organization you know CU they're
00:16:22.000 like the ministry of truth type of thing
00:16:23.920 in O um you know
00:16:27.000 uh they like there censorship
00:16:29.399 organization yeah um and they organiz
00:16:31.759 and and they pushed uh the advertisers
00:16:33.639 to boycott uh so we still have like some
00:16:37.040 of the boycott is is is starting to lift
00:16:40.040 um and I think if Trump wins we'll we'll
00:16:43.040 see you know probably a lot most most of
00:16:45.680 the boycott lift um but if if Kamala
00:16:47.600 wins we'll see that boycott get stronger
00:16:50.519 and and they'll they'll freaking shut
00:16:51.680 down there's no way that that the sort
00:16:54.040 of Kamala po regime would allow X to
00:16:56.360 exist you really think that they'll be
00:16:57.680 able to shut it down though is there
00:16:59.120 Pathway to that uh yes what would they
00:17:02.360 do
00:17:04.679 um well I mean they can just they can
00:17:07.160 sck the doj on you know and say like you
00:17:10.559 know they've had this whole thing about
00:17:11.679 like hate speech misinformation whatever
00:17:13.400 except they're the ones pushing the
00:17:15.039 misinformation but that doesn't stop
00:17:16.720 them from filing massive you know
00:17:18.679 lawsuits and using the doj I mean like
00:17:21.640 the doj is you know been attacking
00:17:24.240 SpaceX for example for not hiring Asylum
00:17:26.760 Seekers even though it is legal for
00:17:28.439 SpaceX to hire anyone who is not a
00:17:30.880 permanent resident of the us so we we're
00:17:33.360 downed if we do and downed if we don't
00:17:35.760 there an examp just an example of what
00:17:37.080 drj can do so it's illegal to hire
00:17:39.480 someone who's not an American citizen um
00:17:42.320 for what SpaceX uh is considered an an
00:17:45.400 advanced weapons technology so it's it's
00:17:48.000 covered by International traffic and
00:17:49.400 arms regulations because we make rocket
00:17:51.640 technology that can be used against the
00:17:52.919 United States so like if North North
00:17:54.760 Korea or Iran got SpaceX rocket
00:17:56.600 technology they could use that to launch
00:17:58.200 nukes at America America right that
00:17:59.760 would be bad yeah that'd be really bad
00:18:02.120 that would be really bad so so we're
00:18:04.640 we're uh since we are in like the most
00:18:07.080 extreme category of weapons technology
00:18:08.720 at SpaceX um under us itar law it is uh
00:18:13.640 illegal for us to hire anyone who's not
00:18:15.240 a permanent resident because the
00:18:16.880 presumption um is that if they're not a
00:18:18.919 permanent resident they're going to
00:18:20.280 return to their home country and take
00:18:22.799 the rocket technology with them so
00:18:25.159 that's and so so it's illegal for us to
00:18:27.520 hire um anyone who's not a either has
00:18:30.760 not a per they can they can be have a
00:18:32.080 green card or be a citizen they just
00:18:33.440 have to be a permanent resident of the
00:18:34.919 United States um then there's another
00:18:37.600 law that says if you if you discriminate
00:18:39.600 against Asylum Seekers that's also
00:18:42.360 you're also breaking the
00:18:44.760 law so they they just so that the drj
00:18:48.159 which the DJ drj can only do a small
00:18:50.159 number of big lawsuits every year laun a
00:18:52.080 giant lawsuit against SpaceX uh saying
00:18:54.679 that SpaceX uh discriminated against
00:18:57.240 Asylum Seekers and we're like but we're
00:18:59.440 like but it's illegal for us to hire
00:19:01.000 anyone who's not a permanent resident so
00:19:03.840 we're in this like this is what I mean
00:19:04.960 it's like or well the orell situation is
00:19:07.200 getting insane like you're damned if you
00:19:09.840 do and you're damned if you don't so
00:19:12.080 you're damned can you imagine history
00:19:14.240 looking back f up man at when you watch
00:19:17.679 the robot arms catch the rocket and you
00:19:20.200 realize like this is like one of the
00:19:21.720 greatest accomplishments in the history
00:19:24.520 of Aerospace like it is one of the more
00:19:26.640 wildest accomplishments when you watch
00:19:28.480 that thing come and you see all the
00:19:29.880 people cheering and it catches it
00:19:31.880 perfectly like holy [ __ ] imagine how
00:19:35.600 history is going to look back at the doj
00:19:38.240 going after that company yeah how insane
00:19:41.480 it is a big lawsuit with an army of
00:19:43.720 lawyers like this was not like some
00:19:45.080 minor thing but it doesn't even make any
00:19:46.600 sense logically like how can it even get
00:19:48.559 brought to court if it's illegal that's
00:19:50.880 exactly so that's what I mean like like
00:19:53.000 like basically if the government wants
00:19:54.480 to go after you they'll just find a
00:19:55.880 reason you it's like that famous quote
00:19:58.240 um from barrier you know like so like
00:20:00.480 Stalin's Like Chief torturer the head of
00:20:03.360 St Stalin's secret police and he's like
00:20:05.559 Chief torturer truly evil human being
00:20:07.640 like this guy barrier uh he his one of
00:20:10.480 his famous quotes was show me the man
00:20:12.159 and I'll show you the crime right they
00:20:14.880 just they just they they like they
00:20:16.760 decide that you're the Target and then
00:20:18.440 they figure out the crime
00:20:20.280 afterwards that's the issue they decided
00:20:23.480 SpaceX was a Target they just figured
00:20:25.720 out the crime afterwards which is so
00:20:27.000 crazy because that's exactly what they
00:20:28.720 saying Trump is going to do if he gets
00:20:30.960 into office they're doing all the things
00:20:33.080 that they accuse Trump of doing yeah
00:20:35.840 openly openly yeah I mean the the sheer
00:20:39.000 number of hoaxes that the Democratic
00:20:41.120 party is pushing over and over again
00:20:43.919 they and and it's like look I understand
00:20:45.840 like politicians are going to you know
00:20:48.360 exaggerate they're going
00:20:50.280 to misspeak and they'll tell occasional
00:20:53.720 you know untruths whatever that's that's
00:20:55.440 how it is in politics but when you have
00:20:57.840 deliberate inerted repeated pushing of
00:21:01.799 hoaxes you're like wait a second like
00:21:04.280 come on man this is too this is too far
00:21:06.480 and you're supposed to be the good guys
00:21:07.640 you're supposed and you claim to be the
00:21:09.360 good guys I'm like exactly you're
00:21:10.919 supposed to be the progressives yes the
00:21:12.720 dams are like oh we're the good guys
00:21:13.960 we're the honest people no no hang on
00:21:16.200 you can't claim to be the good guys you
00:21:17.440 can't claim to be the honest people if
00:21:18.720 you're deliberately post pushing hoaxes
00:21:22.080 that have been debunked thoroughly yeah
00:21:25.520 like even Snopes which is a liberal
00:21:27.400 thing says it's bogus yeah like the fine
00:21:29.720 people ho Obama just said that on stage
00:21:32.600 just said that I was like what the
00:21:33.600 flying [ __ ] he doesn't give a [ __ ] he
00:21:35.960 doesn't give a [ __ ] they're just they're
00:21:37.240 just FL goddamn [ __ ] lie flat out lie
00:21:39.919 flat out [ __ ] lie how about the other
00:21:41.120 one where kamala's campaign used what
00:21:43.240 Trump was saying about protecting women
00:21:45.240 and uh from illegal immigrants thank you
00:21:47.640 you remember that that he what he was
00:21:49.840 saying is the women like it or not I'm
00:21:52.080 going to do it yeah when he was saying
00:21:54.159 that they were trying to say that he was
00:21:55.919 taking away women's right to choose
00:21:58.000 whether women like it or not like that's
00:21:59.679 not what he was saying absolutely he was
00:22:01.240 literally talking about protecting them
00:22:03.400 from dangerous people that are sneaking
00:22:04.880 in through the Border yes exactly
00:22:06.840 they'll take like like not even a full
00:22:08.520 sentence like a half a sentence from
00:22:10.039 Trump and then and then they'll push it
00:22:12.039 on on every ad every you know every
00:22:14.799 speaking event every and it gets
00:22:16.240 repeated on the news this is what's
00:22:18.360 crazy they'll talk about it on these new
00:22:20.559 shows quote new shows yeah exactly I
00:22:23.600 mean um I mean a recent one that that
00:22:25.919 came up um which had a lot of people cuz
00:22:28.720 you a lot of people reached out to me
00:22:30.679 was like they're like oh Trump says he
00:22:33.080 wants to execute Liz Cheney I'm like
00:22:35.600 that is utter [ __ ] it's not what he
00:22:37.240 said at all it's not what he said at all
00:22:38.919 he all he said was like was like what he
00:22:41.120 was saying is that look if if Liz Chene
00:22:43.840 uh um actually had to fight at the front
00:22:47.480 lines should think twice about going to
00:22:49.919 war exactly that like it's easy to go
00:22:52.520 it's easy to go to war it's easy to be a
00:22:54.120 warmonger if you don't have to you know
00:22:56.000 risk dying at the front lines like if
00:22:58.600 other like basically it's [ __ ] up if
00:23:00.760 if people are having like fancy dinners
00:23:02.919 in Washington DC um while people are
00:23:05.840 being slaughtered in trenches you know
00:23:08.240 it's like you're not feeling the pain
00:23:10.480 exactly you're not taking the risk it's
00:23:11.960 someone else dying that's like that's
00:23:14.480 that's cruel and lacking in empathy um
00:23:17.279 and and all Trump was saying was that
00:23:19.520 it's like Liz cheny would be much Liz
00:23:22.240 cheny would be much less of a warmonger
00:23:23.799 because she's a huge warmonger just like
00:23:25.360 her dad um if uh she actually had had to
00:23:28.799 go to the front lines and fight herself
00:23:30.559 and meanwhile they're saying that he
00:23:31.760 should he's saying she should be shot
00:23:33.880 yes which is a total lie but I had like
00:23:37.279 tons of people call me this weekend
00:23:38.559 saying oh Trump says he's going to put
00:23:40.760 Liz train in a firing squad I'm like
00:23:42.919 that is an outrageous lie and the Legacy
00:23:45.880 Media ran with that lie big time yeah
00:23:48.200 it's crazy it's it's just wild to see
00:23:50.279 and if it wasn't for Twitter or X now I
00:23:53.360 don't think we would know about all this
00:23:54.919 stuff I I think it would be very
00:23:56.880 difficult for you I think YouTube
00:23:58.840 throttled they did something weird they
00:24:00.679 won't say what they did but they did
00:24:01.960 something weird with the Trump interview
00:24:03.200 that I did yeah where you couldn't find
00:24:04.679 it it doesn't make sense like like made
00:24:07.480 no sense I mean it's like the it was
00:24:09.080 like the biggest interview on Earth yeah
00:24:11.080 and you can't find it yeah not only that
00:24:13.159 it wasn't trending [ __ ] it wasn't
00:24:15.640 trending it wasn't trending it wasn't
00:24:18.480 trending you're
00:24:21.000 like like this just no excuse for that
00:24:23.200 man no excuse there's no excuse it was
00:24:24.760 getting a million views 1 Point what was
00:24:27.039 it 1.4 an hour one point in time 1.5 an
00:24:30.399 hour yeah and it wasn't trending yeah
00:24:32.720 like and and it's like it's it's like
00:24:34.000 your channel is a known channel it's not
00:24:35.919 it's not like it was started yesterday
00:24:37.919 it's like yeah it's like this is a high
00:24:41.159 trust yours is a high trust channel it's
00:24:42.840 like like you're not trying to sell scam
00:24:45.559 crypto coins or something you know um so
00:24:48.600 well thank God we put it on X as well
00:24:50.559 because I think just with your account
00:24:51.840 and my account alone it's like 70
00:24:53.799 million views yeah exactly yeah well
00:24:56.640 it's like you can't hide things anymore
00:24:58.480 because of you and if it wasn't for you
00:25:00.399 I think they would have had total
00:25:01.600 control of social media by now they
00:25:03.399 would have th they they banned so many
00:25:05.279 accounts during the pandemic so many
00:25:07.919 dissenting scientists and doctors and
00:25:10.200 Physicians they banned so many
00:25:12.279 conspiracy theorists so many people that
00:25:14.080 colored Outside the Lines they would
00:25:16.240 have done that everywhere and it it
00:25:18.480 probably would have P I think even at
00:25:20.559 what's going on at Facebook they're
00:25:22.360 they're being more lenient you know you
00:25:23.919 hear Zuckerberg talking about taking a
00:25:26.039 more libertarian stance that's entirely
00:25:28.799 reaction to the way Twitter has kind of
00:25:31.320 moved the watermark exactly so um as
00:25:35.640 soon as as soon as any company steps out
00:25:37.440 of line and is willing to actually have
00:25:39.039 the truth debated on their platform it
00:25:40.720 forces the other platforms to allow
00:25:42.960 things to be more truthful to to not
00:25:46.120 censor because their censorship becomes
00:25:48.960 glaringly obvious yes um yes and you
00:25:51.919 know the the the best thing I found for
00:25:54.200 as a rebuttal like if somebody if
00:25:55.760 there's a hoax is just go to the source
00:25:57.360 material you know if if you think if
00:25:59.360 somebody thinks uh you know oh you know
00:26:02.679 Trump said that that we should put Liz
00:26:04.279 Cheney in a firing squad I'm like let
00:26:06.520 let me send you a link to X so you can
00:26:08.360 watch his video that's the best way it's
00:26:11.480 it's don't don't take my opinion for it
00:26:13.039 don't take anyone's opinion for it go to
00:26:14.720 the source material and Community notes
00:26:16.880 yes and Community a community notes is
00:26:18.360 the best it's awesome it's incredible
00:26:20.360 because everybody gets checked yes
00:26:22.600 including me yeah um and with Community
00:26:25.000 notes the all the software is open
00:26:27.600 source and all the data is open source
00:26:30.440 so you can recreate any given note
00:26:33.399 independently that's amazing yeah that's
00:26:35.679 how it's total absolute transparency in
00:26:38.960 every way um you know sometimes I get I
00:26:41.360 get asked like oh y can you remove a
00:26:43.200 note you know mostly by the left but
00:26:45.919 sometimes by the right I'm like I'm like
00:26:47.799 I don't even remove remove notes on my
00:26:49.320 own account nothing and and and by the
00:26:51.159 way everything is totally open so if I
00:26:53.120 did that it would stick out like a sore
00:26:55.200 thumb immediately like it's not going to
00:26:57.480 be subtle is the best counter to
00:27:00.039 misinformation yes absolutely like let
00:27:02.480 everybody look at it and say okay here's
00:27:04.799 what the actual facts say yes exactly
00:27:07.000 the counter to misinformation is better
00:27:08.760 information not just that but having it
00:27:11.120 checked in real time by the community so
00:27:13.399 you have millions of people that can go
00:27:14.880 over it and debate whether or not this
00:27:17.000 is true or that's true yes and and just
00:27:19.880 and like I said the best way to
00:27:21.919 understand the truth of things is don't
00:27:23.120 take anyone's opinion for it look at the
00:27:24.799 source material you know so it's like
00:27:27.120 look at what someone actually said look
00:27:28.799 at what someone actually did look at the
00:27:30.559 real videos of the situation and and
00:27:32.440 then you can actually you'll know what's
00:27:34.320 real so as of today when you were
00:27:38.399 literally on your way here you sent me
00:27:39.799 this text saying that they're trying to
00:27:41.519 lock you up in jail Pennsylvania tell me
00:27:43.919 what the [ __ ] is happening well you know
00:27:46.279 there's the classic sort of Soros da
00:27:48.200 situation um so we we're making a lot of
00:27:51.200 progress in Pennsylvania so uh you know
00:27:53.399 I've been I've given a whole bunch of
00:27:55.480 talks in throughout the the state
00:27:57.600 because psylvia is the Lynch pen in this
00:27:59.399 election you know whoever wins
00:28:00.880 Pennsylvania wins the election so um so
00:28:04.720 I've been giving to I spent three years
00:28:06.279 in Pennsylvania I went to college in in
00:28:08.120 Philadelphia so um so it's not like I'm
00:28:11.600 not a total I'm not a total stranger to
00:28:13.240 the state you know I spent three years
00:28:14.480 there um and
00:28:17.279 um and and we you know we we we we've
00:28:19.799 organized this uh petition in support of
00:28:22.600 the Constitution um which I think is a
00:28:25.679 good thing um and and specifically
00:28:28.600 asking people to uh and and and we
00:28:31.960 wanted this to be like um registered
00:28:35.679 voters in swing States like basically we
00:28:37.440 want to send a message to the
00:28:38.760 politicians to say that the people care
00:28:40.880 about the Constitution because there
00:28:42.200 have been all these attacks on the
00:28:43.360 Constitution they've been especially on
00:28:45.399 the Democrat side they've been
00:28:46.960 repeatedly saying that that the that the
00:28:48.640 first amendment is an obstacle because
00:28:51.519 and they're claiming oh the first
00:28:52.640 amendment is is is enabling dis
00:28:54.600 disinformation misinformation and I'm
00:28:56.240 like yo there's a reason for the first
00:28:58.120 Amendment like freedom of speech the
00:29:00.640 reason they the founders of the country
00:29:03.039 put you know the freedom of speech there
00:29:05.039 is because they came from countries
00:29:06.399 where if you spoke your mind you would
00:29:08.919 get shot or imprisoned that's why the
00:29:11.640 First Amendment exists and the Second
00:29:13.919 Amendment is there to stop the tney of
00:29:15.799 government the Second Amendment the
00:29:17.799 right to bear arms is there to protect
00:29:20.080 freedom of
00:29:21.440 speech
00:29:23.440 um you know um
00:29:29.679 you know and I've had these debates
00:29:31.279 especially with people in LA because
00:29:32.919 they're they're like want to take
00:29:33.640 everyone's guns away and I'm like
00:29:35.600 yo can you guarantee me that the
00:29:38.679 government that we will never have a
00:29:40.360 tyrannical government in the in the
00:29:41.720 United States can you can you make that
00:29:43.279 guarantee they're like well nobody can
00:29:45.840 make that guarantee I'm like then we
00:29:47.399 need to keep our guns because that's the
00:29:49.679 that's what's going to stop it that
00:29:51.919 sounds crazy for people to hear because
00:29:53.840 they think about gun violence and gun
00:29:55.880 problems and gun this and gun that but
00:29:58.519 that's the reality of the world that we
00:30:00.399 live in is that tyranny is possible and
00:30:02.960 it exists other places and it's slowly
00:30:05.200 existing it's slowly rearing its head in
00:30:08.080 the UK you're you're seeing I I think
00:30:11.399 the the number of people that have been
00:30:13.080 arrested for just social media uh posts
00:30:16.200 is bananas it's in the thousands yes
00:30:18.559 several thousand people have been have
00:30:20.200 been given prison sentences sentences in
00:30:22.480 the UK for social media posts that where
00:30:25.600 there was no explicit link to actual
00:30:28.000 violence but they just said it
00:30:29.840 encouraged violence like well did anyone
00:30:31.880 actually do anything as a result of that
00:30:33.720 media post well no but they they just
00:30:36.840 and and then they have a prison
00:30:38.000 overcrowding situation in the UK so they
00:30:40.720 quite literally releasing convicted
00:30:43.480 pedophiles and putting people in jail
00:30:45.600 for Facebook posts that's an actual
00:30:48.240 thing happening in Britain that is so
00:30:51.720 wild like it's you're like so wild the
00:30:55.200 [ __ ] you know is going on and what's
00:30:56.880 insane to me fiction again yeah you know
00:30:59.760 but it's all being encouraged by the
00:31:01.120 left kangi Brown Jackson John
00:31:04.519 KY johnry was one of the people who said
00:31:06.679 that he's on camera re like a few weeks
00:31:09.039 ago saying that the first amendment is a
00:31:11.200 pro is an obstacle to fighting
00:31:13.039 misinformation yeah that's crazy that's
00:31:15.360 such a crazy thing to say when you have
00:31:16.960 a solution in community notes you have a
00:31:19.559 solution in something like that that
00:31:21.080 could clear everything up any confusion
00:31:22.760 within a day or two and and even without
00:31:24.600 a community note you can reply to a post
00:31:26.720 and with with evidence that that that
00:31:28.760 shows that the post is wrong you don't
00:31:30.279 even need Community notes I mean
00:31:31.399 Community notes is helpful because it
00:31:32.639 sticks to the original note yes but in
00:31:34.480 the replies you can say here's why
00:31:36.399 you're wrong here are the reasons and
00:31:37.760 here's the evidence the argument is that
00:31:39.760 people are too unsophisticated that
00:31:42.360 they're not going to research these
00:31:44.159 things they're going to be a victim of
00:31:45.840 misinformation so they're going to read
00:31:47.399 something it's incorrect they're going
00:31:48.919 to run with it people are going to die
00:31:51.240 people are going to we're going to ruin
00:31:52.440 the world because people believed in
00:31:54.159 misinformation it's a stupid argument
00:31:55.960 it's a stupid argument because it's an
00:31:57.000 argument that they're too dumb to know
00:31:58.679 what's right or wrong you if you know
00:32:00.519 cuz you're saying it's misinformation
00:32:02.240 why do you think that you're smarter
00:32:04.000 than everybody who reads that exactly
00:32:06.519 and obviously anyone on the X system uh
00:32:08.799 knows that things are posted and then
00:32:10.720 there are replies and there are bules
00:32:12.159 and it's immediately corrected but where
00:32:14.039 are the corrections for the Legacy Media
00:32:15.760 right you know when when if um you know
00:32:18.880 some broadcast media they they they they
00:32:21.360 they said St say false things all the
00:32:23.399 time but it's a one-way Street there's
00:32:25.039 no rebuttal there's no counter right you
00:32:27.559 know there who's apologized for being
00:32:30.840 incorrect about what did Rachel mat ever
00:32:33.200 apologize for telling everybody that if
00:32:35.000 you get the covid vaccine you're never
00:32:36.440 going to get Co it won't the virus stops
00:32:38.760 with you never no one ever it's just it
00:32:41.360 was not true at the time there was no
00:32:42.880 evidence to support it at the time it's
00:32:44.720 pure propaganda and she said it the
00:32:46.639 Russia gate hoax the for three [ __ ]
00:32:49.480 years they said that he was Putin's toy
00:32:52.559 and that Putin had him compromised the
00:32:54.240 steel dossier steel dosier was
00:32:55.679 completely fabricated by a lawyer poins
00:32:58.240 koi um uh who was paid by the Clinton
00:33:01.360 campaign literally crazy and still
00:33:03.840 people think the Russia hoax is real and
00:33:05.679 there's no repercussions no one had to
00:33:07.559 apologize Hillary could never came out
00:33:09.559 and apologize for that and people still
00:33:11.080 listen to her the whole thing is crazy
00:33:13.559 and it's all coming from the left which
00:33:15.559 growing up as a a person who was in the
00:33:17.639 left my whole life it doesn't make any
00:33:19.240 [ __ ] sense same same I mean I I I I
00:33:21.679 even I I I was on the left until like
00:33:24.559 three years
00:33:25.760 ago like I I mean you know it's not the
00:33:29.919 left anymore it's not the left anymore
00:33:31.600 it's just like I think we obviously want
00:33:34.760 I mean I I I believe like we want
00:33:36.519 freedom like like we want we want to
00:33:39.240 maximize person personal Liberty uh I
00:33:42.080 think we want we want to be kind to
00:33:43.360 people you know we want to have empathy
00:33:46.080 uh and um but but it's very important to
00:33:49.880 have personal freedom and a merit based
00:33:51.600 society on the left is is wants
00:33:55.039 to oppress your freedoms especially
00:33:57.399 freedom speech um and they want to they
00:34:00.760 want to have a non-m marit based society
00:34:02.720 you know with race based and sex based
00:34:04.399 preferences and it's like well wait a
00:34:06.000 second no we just want people to succeed
00:34:08.440 based on their skills and their hard
00:34:09.800 work and if they don't want people to
00:34:12.119 express themselves about particular
00:34:13.760 issues then they're not doing the will
00:34:15.119 of the people and if they're trying to
00:34:16.679 suppress people's ability to communicate
00:34:18.199 they're only doing that because they
00:34:19.679 want to do things that people don't want
00:34:21.639 them to do and they want to silence
00:34:23.960 opposition that's all it is and the fact
00:34:26.520 that people can't see that they want to
00:34:28.000 call Trump a
00:34:29.520 fascist the whole thing is through the
00:34:32.359 Looking Glass it's just I mean it's like
00:34:33.800 one hoax after another that that they're
00:34:35.760 perpetrating against Trump I me like
00:34:36.800 they try to call the the rally at
00:34:38.119 Madison Square Gardens Like A Nazi rally
00:34:39.879 I'm like yo there was like literally an
00:34:42.119 Israeli flag in the audience um I think
00:34:44.800 like a quarter of the speakers were
00:34:46.359 Jewish like there was like there were
00:34:47.918 people of every race color creed
00:34:49.399 religion at that at that rally like tell
00:34:51.520 me what about that is Nazi no and yet it
00:34:54.679 was portrayed as a Nazi rally MSNBC they
00:34:57.119 they literally showed video of the Nazi
00:34:59.040 Rally from 1930s and then compared it to
00:35:01.480 the Trump rally now ignoring the fact
00:35:04.119 that [ __ ] Jimmy Carter spoke there
00:35:07.440 there have been dozens of political
00:35:08.720 rallies at medicine Square Gardens
00:35:10.400 dozens on the on the Democrat side like
00:35:12.880 people and people on X like and here's
00:35:15.160 exactly here's Jimmy Carter and here's
00:35:17.920 Bill Clinton and here's wait a second
00:35:20.320 actually it looks like uh every
00:35:21.839 presidential candidate has done a uh on
00:35:24.119 the Democrat side has done a rally at
00:35:25.880 mass square gardens are they Nazis too
00:35:28.040 but what they're doing is they're
00:35:29.200 praying on lwi information voters who
00:35:31.359 aren't engaged actively on social media
00:35:33.760 who don't have the time to look through
00:35:36.160 everything exactly yeah like people are
00:35:39.160 living if people are just on looking at
00:35:41.240 Legacy mainstream media then they have a
00:35:43.160 totally different worldview than if
00:35:44.320 they're on X uh and and seeing the the
00:35:46.640 actual flow of argument yes and the
00:35:48.680 actual evidence well what was the push
00:35:51.400 back like what happened when you guys
00:35:53.319 released the Twitter files cuz I think
00:35:55.000 the Twitter files is probably one of the
00:35:56.599 most important things in this age of
00:35:58.520 information for understanding the
00:36:00.400 influence that government has on social
00:36:02.200 media and and on discourse because when
00:36:05.119 when we found out that that was the case
00:36:06.960 that the government was actually asking
00:36:09.079 Twitter to remove posts that were
00:36:10.640 factual did they did the same thing to
00:36:12.760 Facebook they had them throttle pieces
00:36:15.160 of one of Tucker Carlson's show they
00:36:17.160 they suppress the views by 50% yeah of
00:36:20.760 factual information yeah no there was
00:36:22.680 there was massive government
00:36:23.520 interference in Twitter um but but like
00:36:25.400 Twitter welcomed it that's important to
00:36:27.760 old Twitter welcomed it uh I mean TW old
00:36:31.240 Twitter was controlled by by far-left
00:36:34.119 activists yeah so uh and and uh they
00:36:39.000 they welcomed the Govern interference
00:36:41.079 the Govern they got paid by the
00:36:42.160 government for it that's crazy they got
00:36:44.400 paid for their time correct yeah they
00:36:46.160 got paid millions of dollars for for
00:36:47.839 suppressing information so it's like
00:36:49.400 Bill and a bunch of it was like flat out
00:36:50.920 illegal like the FBI had this like this
00:36:53.200 this this sort of magic portal into the
00:36:54.920 Twitter system uh and and but all of the
00:36:58.680 communication in that sort in this
00:37:00.119 portal was autod deleted after two weeks
00:37:02.319 which breaks Federal Foy laws so we
00:37:05.119 don't even know what was said because it
00:37:06.440 was all deleted after two weeks that's
00:37:08.760 insane yeah that's so crazy it's so
00:37:11.319 crazy that people thought that was okay
00:37:12.920 it's not super not okay no it's super
00:37:15.240 not okay it's unconstitutional and no
00:37:17.880 one would want that no one would want
00:37:19.800 the government to have that kind of
00:37:21.240 access exactly and what was the blowback
00:37:24.680 like when all that stuff got released
00:37:27.560 like you had to anticipate that there
00:37:29.200 was going to be problems when you when
00:37:31.040 you release that like what was what
00:37:33.280 happened well we got a lot of we we did
00:37:36.079 lose a lot of advertising dollars um
00:37:40.040 and um which is crazy because it's
00:37:42.880 essentially like one of the most
00:37:44.119 important forms of Journalism is
00:37:45.880 exposing government corruption yes I
00:37:48.520 mean this is the weird weird thing it's
00:37:50.079 like the left used to be uh big big on
00:37:53.200 exposing government corruption but now
00:37:55.160 but once they control the government
00:37:56.440 they no longer want to EXP the
00:37:57.800 government corruption right they want to
00:38:00.119 pretend that the leftwing government's
00:38:01.599 incapable of corruption cuz we're on the
00:38:03.720 good side I I think it maybe just like
00:38:06.400 you know whoever's in power kind of
00:38:08.800 doesn't want the you know the other side
00:38:11.400 hurt um because as you pointed out like
00:38:14.800 the left historically up until I don't
00:38:17.880 know maybe even 10 years ago or
00:38:19.359 something like that um was the Free
00:38:21.920 Speech party and now it's the anti-free
00:38:24.760 speech party and they just they use they
00:38:26.800 use words like
00:38:28.440 like oh we have to be against hate
00:38:30.240 speech and misinformation
00:38:32.680 disinformation but these are propaganda
00:38:34.599 words you know it's like uh well who's
00:38:37.319 defining hate speech who's defining
00:38:38.839 misinformation the government do you
00:38:40.680 really trust the government to make that
00:38:42.880 definition
00:38:44.720 um the whole point of the of the first
00:38:47.880 amendment is like you do not trust the
00:38:49.880 government well especially when they're
00:38:51.839 wrong and then there's no repercussions
00:38:54.680 yeah like with the whole Lab leak theory
00:38:56.640 if you get you would get kicked off of
00:38:58.400 YouTube if you even presented this
00:39:01.400 argument that hey maybe that Corona
00:39:03.599 virus lab where they're doing work on
00:39:05.760 the exact same virus that got released
00:39:08.079 yep hey maybe that's where it came from
00:39:10.119 since that's where the virus started
00:39:11.800 what do you think guys yeah they kick
00:39:13.680 you right off of YouTube yeah um yes
00:39:17.319 exactly it's like do you think maybe the
00:39:20.839 it could have come from the place called
00:39:22.640 the novel Corona virus Research
00:39:24.440 Institute that John Stewart bit that he
00:39:26.160 did on coar was amazing what does it say
00:39:28.920 on the door again uh can I see you a
00:39:30.560 business
00:39:31.480 card and to see coar like resisting it
00:39:35.280 with every fiber of his what's going to
00:39:37.720 happen to us he was totally [ __ ]
00:39:39.400 blocking the bit to the point where John
00:39:40.960 Stewart got off his chair and started
00:39:43.079 walking around to try to take control
00:39:46.040 yeah good on John and then the left
00:39:47.800 tried to cancel John Stewart of course
00:39:49.800 meanwhile he was right he right and no
00:39:51.560 apologies no apologies yeah and you know
00:39:55.240 the whole fouchy thing like any
00:39:56.880 criticism of fouchy it's like an
00:39:59.760 freaking demon if you ask me if you read
00:40:02.079 rfk's book if the real Anthony fouchy if
00:40:04.839 that's correct if the facts are in there
00:40:07.000 that's true it's all referenced you
00:40:08.680 could find the sources and on top of it
00:40:10.480 he's never been sued for that book which
00:40:12.440 doesn't make any sense if he just made a
00:40:14.040 bunch of Lies up he would get sued yes
00:40:16.200 so the guy's a monster I think so yeah I
00:40:18.640 think so too yeah yeah yeah yeah I think
00:40:21.200 like just looking at the lies that he
00:40:24.319 told the way he tried to Define gain of
00:40:26.680 function research to ran Paul but he I
00:40:30.359 think a lot maybe a lot of people out
00:40:31.440 there don't realize Fouch he funded the
00:40:34.040 the the the bioweapons research that was
00:40:36.359 going on in in Wuhan and he he Bank
00:40:38.440 shotted off like he can't send the money
00:40:40.200 directly to China he just bankshot it
00:40:41.560 off Eco Health right this just like fake
00:40:44.040 nonprofit in the US and they sent it to
00:40:46.280 Wuhan and Obama put the skids on that he
00:40:48.520 stopped that in 2014 yes I mean so you
00:40:50.839 know um to to give Obama throw Obama
00:40:53.880 give Obama some credit he actually was
00:40:55.520 like looking at this and say hey this is
00:40:56.760 crazy and uh we need and he so he he
00:41:00.000 actually did uh stop the like like the
00:41:04.119 so-called G gain of function again a
00:41:05.720 propaganda word uh because what is the
00:41:08.040 function they're talking about death
00:41:11.240 right right so if if if you actually use
00:41:15.599 the right word this is gain of function
00:41:18.079 is death
00:41:19.640 maximization right then you're like oh
00:41:22.040 oh hey guys should refund uh uh
00:41:25.240 bioweapon Research into death
00:41:26.720 maximization
00:41:27.880 cuz that's what gain of function means
00:41:29.839 yeah it means the function making a
00:41:31.560 disease so that people can get it give
00:41:33.880 it to people and by the way what's that
00:41:36.359 function again oh the function is death
00:41:38.240 okay so just call it a death maximizing
00:41:39.920 virus if you're doing research on that
00:41:42.359 and the idea behind this research is so
00:41:44.359 that we can cure these things how come
00:41:46.079 you don't have a [ __ ] cure start with
00:41:48.599 a start with a cure cure first disease
00:41:50.760 second it doesn't make any sense like
00:41:52.400 you guys had no strategy for dealing
00:41:54.400 with it if it got out and so you have to
00:41:56.720 like make up this this new vaccine in
00:42:00.280 like record time operation warp speed
00:42:02.800 released to the people with very little
00:42:04.440 testing it's [ __ ] crazy it was crazy
00:42:07.000 the whole thing's crazy and everybody
00:42:08.240 just went along with it Looney Tunes
00:42:10.240 Next Level well it's the scop was
00:42:12.560 fascinating to watch people step in line
00:42:14.640 that's like one of the biggest SS of all
00:42:15.800 time of all time of all time and
00:42:18.880 everybody got in line and when you take
00:42:21.480 it back to when pharmaceutical drug
00:42:23.720 companies were able to advertise on
00:42:25.319 media in the 1990s that Chang
00:42:28.520 one of two countries the whole that
00:42:30.640 allows this and because of that because
00:42:33.000 we don't have socialized medicine it's a
00:42:35.280 complete profit scam and they went hard
00:42:38.800 claiming all sorts of things that were
00:42:41.240 never researched all sorts of things
00:42:42.839 that not supported by data like the fact
00:42:44.839 that it would stop transmission the fact
00:42:46.520 that it would stop infection the fact
00:42:48.319 that it was safe for pregnant women the
00:42:49.880 fact that it was safe for children all
00:42:51.640 of its [ __ ] yes and they pushed it
00:42:53.960 on the whole world and if you didn't say
00:42:56.000 that at a cocktail party you were a
00:42:57.920 pariah yes and you were an antivaxer it
00:43:00.599 was totally psycho it was like being a
00:43:02.319 Holocaust in hour you get kicked out of
00:43:04.480 polite Society exactly [ __ ] bananas
00:43:07.760 and I should say like I'm actually
00:43:09.119 generally Pro vaccine overall you know I
00:43:11.640 think we should look at these things
00:43:13.920 that but that but I believe in the
00:43:15.520 scientific method so so you have a
00:43:18.680 blanket except anything you have a
00:43:20.440 blanket except that any any given
00:43:22.640 medication or any given treatment is is
00:43:24.880 is 100% good you should always be it
00:43:26.960 with some skepticism especially when
00:43:28.760 you're getting the data from
00:43:29.720 pharmaceutical drug companies that have
00:43:31.280 like a long history of criminal got a
00:43:33.400 Ved interest conduct yes they've got a
00:43:35.920 vested interest in the research it's
00:43:38.200 sort of like asking tobacco companies
00:43:39.720 about you know whether smoking it's
00:43:42.000 dangerous you know exactly the same
00:43:43.680 thing like God according to our
00:43:45.200 scientists everything's fine yeah they
00:43:47.000 lied in court forever the same thing
00:43:48.960 they do with oxycoton when they said
00:43:50.520 that it wasn't addictive like they have
00:43:52.640 a long history of being full of [ __ ] if
00:43:54.480 it makes them money and that's what they
00:43:56.000 do that's their business they've
00:43:57.440 literally lost multi-billion dollar
00:43:59.000 lawsuits in this massive massive they're
00:44:01.839 in the you have amazing scientists right
00:44:05.240 you have these clinical researchers
00:44:06.720 these people that developed these
00:44:07.800 incredible drugs and they this is their
00:44:10.440 job their job is to figure out some new
00:44:13.119 way to cure something some new way to
00:44:15.119 stop things and then you have the money
00:44:17.079 people sure and the problem is when you
00:44:19.599 have this one thing that you would
00:44:22.000 assume they're only doing it to help
00:44:23.800 people and then they have this other
00:44:25.599 faction that they're all just numbers
00:44:27.640 people and all they give a [ __ ] about is
00:44:29.480 maximizing profits and making sure they
00:44:31.800 literally have a an obligation to their
00:44:34.440 shareholders they have to make the most
00:44:36.040 amount of money possible and so they
00:44:37.839 just want to push it on everybody regard
00:44:40.160 like the vioc Scandal there's internal
00:44:42.680 emails showing they knew there was going
00:44:44.400 to be cardiovascular events people were
00:44:45.920 going to get strokes and they're like I
00:44:47.640 think we're still going to do well and
00:44:49.599 they did they made like 12 billion
00:44:51.440 dollars they got fined seven and 50 to
00:44:54.040 60,000 people died holy [ __ ] yeah one of
00:44:57.400 them was a friend of mine got a stroke
00:44:59.200 and died yeah no he didn't die he lived
00:45:01.160 but he was a really healthy guy aned the
00:45:04.079 same after yeah NE problems and he took
00:45:06.680 Vio and all a sudden he was slurring his
00:45:08.480 words and he couldn't concentrate and
00:45:10.160 people like I think you're having a
00:45:11.520 [ __ ] stroke and they took him to the
00:45:12.839 hospital and then then you have this
00:45:14.599 giant class action lawsuit then Vio gets
00:45:16.839 pulled from the market and they get sued
00:45:18.480 and the whole thing's [ __ ] crazy but
00:45:20.359 there's a long history of this I think
00:45:23.040 what did what is the number like
00:45:24.160 onethird of the drugs that the FDA
00:45:26.319 approves gets pulled it's [ __ ]
00:45:28.800 bananas that is crazy that's crazy
00:45:31.359 you're shitty at onethird of the things
00:45:33.760 that you say are okay but yet you're
00:45:35.880 trying to stop MDMA therapy for veterans
00:45:39.079 yeah they should let MDMA through
00:45:40.800 honestly that think that actually help a
00:45:42.760 lot of people it would help a lot of
00:45:44.599 people help a lot of people there's a
00:45:46.160 lot of different therapies specifically
00:45:48.480 psilocybin iag the fact you have to go
00:45:50.839 to Mexico to get ibaan therapy for
00:45:53.240 veterans so many guys I've talked to
00:45:55.599 have gone over there and it's like
00:45:57.079 completely giving them a a clean slate
00:45:59.559 refresh their mind and totally new
00:46:02.240 perspective on life alleviated
00:46:03.960 depression cured addictions illegal yeah
00:46:07.280 illegal oxycotton go get it yeah um and
00:46:12.359 I know some people who like their their
00:46:14.040 life was ruined by oxyon you know oh
00:46:16.079 yeah because uh I mean it it really
00:46:17.880 depends on on you know somebody in
00:46:19.480 individual biochemistry um like to me
00:46:21.960 like like um opioids are not addictive
00:46:23.920 to me like I you know I've had them when
00:46:25.680 I've had operations or something and uh
00:46:28.200 they they they're they barely affect the
00:46:30.800 my pain level and they make me like
00:46:32.440 itchy and uncomfortable they make me
00:46:35.319 stupid exactly but but I'm like so so
00:46:39.319 like like I could never get addicted to
00:46:41.440 alcohol or or opioids it's just
00:46:43.200 impossible like because my biochemistry
00:46:45.720 just does not have like but I love tasty
00:46:48.200 food feel like you know you know if if
00:46:50.960 if there's I'm addicted to tasty food
00:46:53.400 sure um but like there can be like I
00:46:56.359 have a whole of of alcohol it's there
00:46:58.079 for decoration I never done sh basically
00:47:00.400 I feel the same way I could easily quit
00:47:02.119 alcohol I mean I'll go weeks without
00:47:04.119 having a drink and doesn't bother me at
00:47:05.520 all but I know some people they have one
00:47:06.880 drink and they're Off to the Races and
00:47:08.400 that's the difference in the the
00:47:09.839 biochemical differences that we all have
00:47:12.359 yeah I mean I think that's the case with
00:47:14.000 a lot of addictions I'm not addicted to
00:47:15.680 gambling but I get it I see it I've seen
00:47:17.640 it in people but I'm I'm I have this
00:47:20.559 aversion to things that I know are going
00:47:21.920 to ruin my life like i' I see it that's
00:47:24.640 why I've never tried cocaine I just saw
00:47:26.319 too many people
00:47:27.520 it looks too fun like I don't want to
00:47:29.319 get involved yeah I mean I mean I think
00:47:31.319 generally for any given uh drug legal or
00:47:34.160 illegal you could the question is can
00:47:37.319 you complete the following sentence
00:47:39.160 blank made me a better
00:47:42.680 person like I've never heard anyone say
00:47:44.760 meth made them a better person or
00:47:46.359 cocaine made them a better person no
00:47:48.359 ever um made a lot of soldiers better I
00:47:51.920 think that's yeah I mean if you're doing
00:47:54.520 if you're like if your soldiers need to
00:47:56.960 for three days in a row yeah it it's
00:48:00.359 really is effective at that you know um
00:48:03.720 yeah people give like France a hard time
00:48:06.160 about you know capitulating in World War
00:48:08.319 II but but you know what's what's worse
00:48:10.319 than the Nazis Nazis on meth me up Nazis
00:48:14.359 they they're not stopping Norman they
00:48:16.760 Six Bullets they're like they're they're
00:48:18.440 still coming that book over there
00:48:20.359 blitzed is all about the use of
00:48:23.000 methamphetamines and the different drugs
00:48:25.040 that they gave their soldiers the guys
00:48:26.800 the front of the line they gave the most
00:48:27.960 meth yes they have different dosages
00:48:30.960 yeah I mean you just basically think
00:48:33.520 you're un vulnerable on meth and uh so
00:48:35.960 so it's one thing like I said it's one
00:48:37.240 thing be you know have have like the
00:48:40.160 Nazis coming after you but Nazis on meth
00:48:41.599 you're like holy [ __ ] those [ __ ] are
00:48:42.640 not stopping man for three days they're
00:48:45.040 not stopping it's so crazy yeah that's
00:48:47.559 not a statement meth may be a better
00:48:49.440 person that you hear very often I've
00:48:50.640 never heard that before no you hear a
00:48:51.920 lot of like siloc iban Advocates you
00:48:53.920 hear a lot of people that talk about
00:48:55.400 psychedelics I exactly I've actually
00:48:57.680 heard many people say that uh LSD or you
00:49:01.520 know mushrooms or uh MDMA made them a
00:49:04.680 better person many people yeah so that's
00:49:07.280 why I'm like I think a rule for the FDA
00:49:10.160 should be like hey look um if you can
00:49:11.760 complete the sentence legal or legal
00:49:13.880 that um blank made you a better person
00:49:16.760 actually yeah uh then then you got a
00:49:19.400 good drug and if you you can't you got a
00:49:21.599 bad drug also if there's drugs that are
00:49:23.920 available right now that can absolutely
00:49:25.680 ruin people's lives
00:49:27.359 this the the rationalization for
00:49:29.240 stopping other drugs that might ruin
00:49:31.000 people's lives but also can help a lot
00:49:32.960 of people's lives it doesn't make any
00:49:34.240 sense right you're you're you're B it's
00:49:35.880 basically the same thing as censorship
00:49:37.880 you're taking away people's ability to
00:49:39.680 discern what's true and not true and
00:49:41.680 you're taking away people's ability to
00:49:43.200 discern what's good for you and not good
00:49:44.680 for you and the way to find that out is
00:49:46.599 to have as much information as possible
00:49:48.680 so to do research and actually to have
00:49:52.440 unbiased actual objective observers who
00:49:55.440 are looking at all this stuff that give
00:49:56.440 you real data yes and the opposite of
00:49:59.599 that or the count of that is like if you
00:50:01.839 don't do that you're empowering cartels
00:50:04.839 yes that's the whole reason why they
00:50:06.640 have all that money it's because it's
00:50:08.599 illegal to sell these drugs in America
00:50:11.000 the demand is never going away so
00:50:13.640 instead of like limiting the amount of
00:50:15.599 drugs now you've got toxic drugs CU
00:50:18.440 Fentanyl and all this other [ __ ] has
00:50:20.079 been because they're not pure so you're
00:50:21.839 just killing people you're not saving
00:50:23.920 anybody by protecting them from
00:50:25.960 themselves true
00:50:27.440 but it's a tricky situation because what
00:50:29.160 do you do like if you just like say okay
00:50:31.240 now everyone can sell all these people
00:50:33.440 that have been selling boner pills now
00:50:35.760 you can sell meth like holy [ __ ] you get
00:50:39.640 you get you get the the the the the
00:50:41.720 double
00:50:42.920 combo the VRA it's the VRA andth right
00:50:46.960 Jesus Christ oh my god oh my god well I
00:50:49.680 mean how many people already doing that
00:50:51.280 right now
00:50:52.839 with there's a lot of people out there
00:50:55.040 that are essentially on M
00:50:57.240 especially people that abuse adol
00:51:00.200 they're basically amphetamin up all day
00:51:02.640 long yeah adol is low-grade infomine
00:51:05.040 yeah um so um
00:51:08.119 the and like I actually seen people like
00:51:12.440 become much worse people if they take
00:51:14.000 too much ader all like much worse you
00:51:15.760 know it's it's like an anger amplifier
00:51:17.359 so there um now now I'm not saying like
00:51:20.760 adol is something like where there's
00:51:22.119 there are pluses and minuses it's not a
00:51:23.599 clearcut issue um it does help some
00:51:25.640 people a great deal
00:51:27.319 um and uh but but in in higher doses man
00:51:30.760 that that stuff I've seen people turn
00:51:32.240 into just raging monsters on on high
00:51:34.359 doses about rle just they're they're
00:51:37.480 just angry like extremely angry all the
00:51:40.319 time yeah they're messed up yeah that's
00:51:43.520 what happens if you take myth it's crazy
00:51:46.359 you turn it like myth turns you into a
00:51:48.119 freaking rage demon and so and so many
00:51:51.599 prescriptions I'm like Jesus we we
00:51:54.240 googled it like one year there was like
00:51:55.839 39 million prescriptions for adal in
00:51:58.160 this country oh yeah yeah like once in a
00:52:00.559 while there's like an adal shortage and
00:52:01.680 like there's like watch Widespread Panic
00:52:03.319 you know and then what do people do and
00:52:05.799 then it's the same thing as like when
00:52:07.359 they tried to like limit the amount of
00:52:08.960 oxyc content will people go to Street
00:52:10.319 heroin and if you're addicted to Aderall
00:52:13.319 and your dealer the guy who sells you
00:52:15.119 weed is like hey man I can get you like
00:52:16.960 like lowgrade meth like the stuff the
00:52:18.799 Nazis took well that they had IG grade
00:52:21.000 myth actually they had pharmaceutical
00:52:22.160 grade it was they had epic epic myth it
00:52:25.319 was like made by the like pharmaceutical
00:52:27.440 grade myth is going to be if like this
00:52:30.799 this I mean I mean you just look at the
00:52:32.880 freaking U Online Wikipedia page but
00:52:35.079 there's like many different versions of
00:52:36.680 math like not all the same um and and
00:52:38.839 they have different effects um so but
00:52:41.359 but like pharmaceutical grade pure meth
00:52:43.359 you are going to be oh my God super
00:52:45.799 productive super productive for a
00:52:47.680 certain period of time and and you're
00:52:49.680 not going to sleep for a while and uh
00:52:52.160 and and then you you will you will have
00:52:53.599 some anger management issues um so like
00:52:57.000 uh they actually the the nazzi they did
00:53:00.720 actually
00:53:02.400 um uh go roll back how much meth they
00:53:05.520 were using because they had they had
00:53:08.040 quite a few incidents of of the of the
00:53:10.119 soldiers killing their officers because
00:53:13.200 they were on too much meth Jesus Christ
00:53:16.799 they would yeah so they would shoot that
00:53:20.119 to many um officer got fragged by the by
00:53:22.960 the you know the their platoon that was
00:53:25.440 on too much meth because they that
00:53:27.960 happened quite a few
00:53:29.319 times like you just when someone's on a
00:53:31.839 lot of meth they're they're they're
00:53:35.200 they're very they can get very angry did
00:53:36.960 you ever pay attention to when John
00:53:38.920 McAfee was uh cooking meth in a lab in
00:53:42.000 his backyard I me MC is quite a
00:53:44.680 character he was a character character
00:53:47.119 we had him on the podcast when he was on
00:53:48.559 the run so he called in from an
00:53:50.680 undisclosed location when he was running
00:53:52.760 from where was he Costa Rica is that
00:53:54.799 where he was B bise right so when he was
00:53:57.640 running from the authorities he called
00:53:59.680 in we had him on the podcast on the run
00:54:02.119 and uh I was asking him about these
00:54:03.960 posts like CU there was an online
00:54:06.079 account that was linked to him where he
00:54:08.319 had this very detailed laboratory like
00:54:11.359 super sophisticated making the best math
00:54:14.280 like a super genius cooking math I I
00:54:17.520 mean I think he like had like he had his
00:54:19.520 lab like he was making like a wide range
00:54:21.880 of drugs uh and there was like I I
00:54:25.160 talked to uh actually like a a reporter
00:54:30.359 um who who went down and like uh
00:54:33.680 interviewed him in bise um and and por
00:54:37.119 said man that's one of the scariest
00:54:38.280 things he's like he he was he was quite
00:54:40.400 terrified so like one of the things like
00:54:43.200 maffy he had I guess this trick where he
00:54:46.240 would he would play a Russian roulette
00:54:47.760 with himself uh so so he'd put a bullet
00:54:50.359 in in the revolver and they spin the
00:54:52.880 spin the chamber and clearly he had like
00:54:54.359 some like trick to you know know it was
00:54:57.480 not there's
00:54:59.480 some you know way that he knows it's not
00:55:01.680 the right bullet but but I do Wonder
00:55:03.680 like if if mcff is high and he does that
00:55:05.680 he's not always going to get the trick
00:55:06.720 right you know do you sure he had a
00:55:08.000 trick or maybe so yeah yeah so so so
00:55:10.559 according to this reporter um when he
00:55:13.040 went to visit maffy in bise uh maffy
00:55:16.040 took out the revolver put a put a a
00:55:17.559 bullet in the revolver spun the chamber
00:55:19.680 and then pointed at his head and went
00:55:21.240 click and the report is like saying
00:55:22.400 please don't do this like this is insane
00:55:24.200 click click click and then pointed to
00:55:28.039 the gun at the ground and ni went click
00:55:29.680 bang and shot shot a bullet in the
00:55:31.119 ground Jesus that's a hell of a potty
00:55:33.520 trick
00:55:34.839 jeez it's the next level party that's
00:55:37.039 the guy who seen the deer hunter too
00:55:38.200 many times he yes remember that scene
00:55:41.039 when they were forcing yes yeah woo
00:55:43.680 that's a heavy scene that was a heavy
00:55:45.000 scene dairo and Christopher Walkin
00:55:46.720 that's one of the greatest scenes in any
00:55:47.960 movie ever I remember watching that
00:55:49.400 scene just like clawing at my pants
00:55:53.680 like Maka was a wild boy wild and you
00:55:57.960 created brilliant anti virus software
00:56:00.440 yeah yeah he may have made some of the
00:56:02.839 viruses too you think so well didn't he
00:56:06.400 like give laptops to a bunch of
00:56:08.559 government organizations with viruses on
00:56:10.960 yeah so that he could like pay ATT to
00:56:12.920 what they were doing yeah I I wouldn't
00:56:16.079 be surprised if somebody whacked that
00:56:17.440 guy I don't know what happened to him
00:56:18.839 but I he would be a guy that would be
00:56:20.880 like this guy is a little bit too
00:56:23.200 loose I probably had sensitive
00:56:25.079 information I don't know um for sure he
00:56:27.319 did u i mean I found him to be an
00:56:29.200 interesting guy I mean like I'm
00:56:31.400 generally like feel like like if
00:56:33.920 somebody's not harming someone else they
00:56:35.319 should be okay now now there is some
00:56:39.440 suggestion that maffy like killed his
00:56:40.920 neighbor in bise um
00:56:43.160 yeah so probably did maybe the neighbor
00:56:46.000 was a douchebag I think he probably did
00:56:47.760 seems like he probably did seem like the
00:56:49.160 neighbor killed his dog yes right and
00:56:51.480 then it seems like he killed the
00:56:52.440 neighbor yeah allegedly yeah I mean it
00:56:55.680 seems it seems likely it's not a zero
00:56:57.920 possibility it's not definitely not zero
00:57:00.760 it's seem more than not he's a methed up
00:57:03.440 wild man playing Russian roulette hey
00:57:04.960 maybe you kill your [ __ ] neighbor yes
00:57:07.079 I mean if somebody killed your dog you'd
00:57:08.359 be really inclined to kill them too yeah
00:57:10.599 somebody killed your squirrel John Wick
00:57:13.160 yeah the [ __ ] squirrel thing is
00:57:15.400 bananas yeah that squirrel thing squirr
00:57:17.880 thing I so here's the thing about the
00:57:20.079 the the whole squirrel thing is is that
00:57:23.160 um how can it be that we live in America
00:57:25.760 uh supposedly land of the free and the
00:57:29.319 you know the government can barge into
00:57:30.799 your home with guns uh so if you resist
00:57:33.760 you're going to get shot um and then
00:57:36.559 take your your pets and execute them um
00:57:41.480 and if they can do that to your pets
00:57:43.640 what do you think they can do to
00:57:45.079 you I know that's not an exaggeration
00:57:48.680 absolutely it sounds like you're you're
00:57:51.000 oh that's so crazy how can you make that
00:57:52.880 connection but it's that's why would you
00:57:55.440 kill that cute little squirrel that was
00:57:57.079 obviously a pet and trained from the
00:57:58.720 time it was a baby if you see the
00:58:00.640 interaction that guy has with that
00:58:01.880 squirrel it was wonderful it was really
00:58:03.839 cute yes absolutely the there's it was
00:58:06.799 just obviously it was a blood pet pet
00:58:08.760 squirrel um and raccoon too um and doing
00:58:13.000 no har um and the the government comes
00:58:17.160 in barges into the guy's house takes his
00:58:20.039 pets and kills them
00:58:22.480 and you know I I think this should this
00:58:24.720 should really get people out there
00:58:26.839 mobilized frankly because um you know
00:58:29.559 you think you see like the John Wick
00:58:30.960 movie where John Wick's like you know he
00:58:33.720 he he wants to he just wants peace like
00:58:36.039 you know in in the Dr movie he just
00:58:37.559 wants he's like listen I want to retire
00:58:39.520 and they offer him like tons of money
00:58:41.200 like because they want him to be an
00:58:42.520 assassin to keep being an assassin like
00:58:44.720 they they like they they like offer him
00:58:46.640 tons of money they threaten him he's
00:58:47.799 like listen I'm not going to be I'm I'm
00:58:49.839 I'm out you know and they kill his dog
00:58:52.839 that was a bad idea
00:58:57.280 that was a really they killed a cute
00:58:58.680 little puppy and the puppy was his
00:59:00.520 ex-wife's gift to him when she died of
00:59:02.760 cancer yeah great movie great movie the
00:59:05.799 best revenge movie of all time cuz it's
00:59:08.880 so ridiculous he kills everybody yeah
00:59:10.839 kills everyone um and you're rooting for
00:59:13.000 him yeah they shouldn't have killed his
00:59:15.400 dog yeah they [ __ ] up and they
00:59:17.200 shouldn't have killed that squirrel they
00:59:18.240 shouldn't have killed that [ __ ] that
00:59:19.319 squirrel I
00:59:21.240 mean like how many how many cases have
00:59:24.799 we not heard about you know
00:59:27.079 a look at that little guy that squirrel
00:59:30.640 clearly had a love relationship with
00:59:33.000 that guy he would hop all over him and
00:59:35.319 climb on him I mean it was that was his
00:59:38.520 pet that that squirrel thought of that
00:59:40.960 man as his protector as his His
00:59:44.280 companion there was nothing wrong with
00:59:46.280 that and in Texas it's totally legal you
00:59:48.520 could have a [ __ ] zebra out here you
00:59:50.400 can have whatever you want and that's
00:59:52.599 the argument for freedom and you know
00:59:54.599 the flip side is you get a bunch of
00:59:55.799 people tigers in their backyard which is
00:59:57.880 not great it's like this was a [ __ ]
01:00:01.039 squirrel it's not it's not an anaconda
01:00:03.240 or right or or or you know you know
01:00:06.079 crocodile or something that's or a
01:00:07.839 chimpanzee did you see chimp crazy oh
01:00:09.960 man chimp chimp chimps will eat your
01:00:12.880 face okay they will [ __ ] you up they
01:00:14.720 will [ __ ] you and they don't even the
01:00:16.240 thing is they don't even kill you they
01:00:17.440 just [ __ ] you chimps don't even kill
01:00:19.400 people yeah which is really weird they
01:00:21.160 just bite your hands off and pite your
01:00:23.000 dick off and tear your face apart yes
01:00:25.480 they want to leave you they could kill
01:00:26.720 you easily if a chimp want to just punch
01:00:28.359 you in the head until you're dead it
01:00:30.039 wouldn't take long but they don't kill
01:00:31.880 you they just rip you apart yeah and you
01:00:35.599 can have a
01:00:36.799 chimp and so well he used to be able to
01:00:38.799 have a chimp in a lot of states and then
01:00:40.480 chimp crazy kind of exposed a lot of
01:00:42.079 that and Peta did a great job of
01:00:43.319 stopping people from keeping chimps as
01:00:45.319 pets because once they hit like five you
01:00:47.359 can't control them anymore what's OB
01:00:48.920 totally understandable if somebody's got
01:00:51.079 um you know a creature that is dangerous
01:00:53.240 to others but like obviously a a
01:00:54.839 squirrel and a raccoon are not well
01:00:56.319 squirrels are [ __ ] everywhere that's
01:00:58.039 what's so crazy like why can't you have
01:00:59.559 it in the house what kind of rules are
01:01:01.319 we dealing with you have rats everywhere
01:01:03.640 yeah um I mean they're they're they're
01:01:06.640 allowing criminals to go free and and
01:01:08.240 like violent criminals to go free but
01:01:09.559 they're like spending your tax dollars
01:01:11.240 to come in and execute your [ __ ] pets
01:01:13.359 what the hell is going on exactly and
01:01:14.960 and it's like um but it's overreach it's
01:01:19.880 it's govern overreach and and this just
01:01:21.240 keeps getting worse every year and
01:01:23.119 that's why that's why we've got to we
01:01:26.240 got to fight back against this um and
01:01:30.359 um you know it's people say like well
01:01:32.960 it's just a squirrel well was it was you
01:01:34.920 know in John Wick's case it was just a
01:01:36.680 dog
01:01:39.200 right yeah you know but well remember
01:01:41.880 the Russian guy said it's a [ __ ] dog
01:01:43.960 it's just a [ __ ] dog just a [ __ ]
01:01:46.240 squirrel
01:01:48.280 yeah well it's the the funniest thing is
01:01:50.680 when so it just I just don't understand
01:01:53.400 how anybody could justify it I don't
01:01:55.119 understand how any I it seems to me that
01:01:57.319 in a logical world all that guy would
01:01:58.839 have to do is say want to you see me
01:02:00.880 with this squirrel this squirrel's a pet
01:02:02.880 yeah like look he he hops on me he eats
01:02:05.640 he sleeps I can keep a Geral but I can't
01:02:07.920 keep a squirrel I can have a guinea pig
01:02:09.640 I can't have a squirrel I can have a
01:02:11.279 chinchilla my daughter has a chinchilla
01:02:13.760 it's adorable adorable little thing
01:02:15.480 climbs all over can't have a squirrel
01:02:18.039 even if they if they did take a squirrel
01:02:19.480 away couldn't they've released it into
01:02:20.799 the woods or something well it's a bit
01:02:23.039 the idea is you have to euthanize it
01:02:24.599 because it's used to being fed it
01:02:26.160 doesn't know how to forage it won't be
01:02:27.839 able to like find a home squirrels are
01:02:30.520 brutal squirrels are absolutely brutal
01:02:32.400 to each other they throw each other out
01:02:33.599 of trees which is one of the reasons why
01:02:35.799 squirrels like can fall from like 30
01:02:37.760 feet and just kind of bounce off the
01:02:39.240 ground and live it's like it's a a
01:02:41.240 natural adaptation because squirrels
01:02:43.839 during mating they bite each other they
01:02:45.920 there used to be like a rumor there was
01:02:48.119 a a myth that squirrels bite each
01:02:50.079 other's nuts off and okay that that
01:02:53.720 seems to be a myth but it came out of
01:02:56.520 the fact that squirrels are so ruthless
01:02:58.720 during mating so like one female is just
01:03:01.440 running away I have squirrels in my
01:03:02.880 backyard I watch it all the time one
01:03:04.559 female apparently goes into estris and
01:03:06.599 all the male squirrels fight to get to
01:03:08.520 her so they're running up trees and
01:03:10.279 chasing each other around trees
01:03:11.799 literally throwing each other off trees
01:03:14.480 to try to like have so if this poor
01:03:16.640 little peanut the squirrel who's used to
01:03:18.319 living with a guy in an apartment like
01:03:20.240 gets out there in the the wild world
01:03:22.200 well fair enough at least they have a
01:03:23.359 chance yeah at least he has a chance but
01:03:25.920 chance how about just leave him with the
01:03:27.160 guy yeah leave him with the guy for sure
01:03:28.640 what the [ __ ] is wrong with you why are
01:03:29.960 you killing that squirrel it doesn't
01:03:31.119 make any sense yeah and then to add
01:03:33.200 insult to injury there were a bunch of
01:03:34.559 people on the left who were like
01:03:36.039 actually posting that they're glad that
01:03:37.400 magga squirrel got killed which is [ __ ]
01:03:39.760 Mega squirrel like the [ __ ] squirrel
01:03:42.000 has an ideology it's a cute little
01:03:43.760 fluffy squirrel exactly well it's it's a
01:03:47.119 nice symbol because most most like
01:03:49.960 reasonable compassionate people think
01:03:51.640 that's terrible and most people who have
01:03:53.599 pets think it's terrible terrible
01:03:56.559 um so I don't know I mean I'm like I
01:03:58.920 hope people just go out there and vote
01:04:00.039 for peanut man if nothing else if
01:04:02.559 nothing else just V I vote for peanut
01:04:05.319 you know they've done such a job of
01:04:07.039 painting Trump as a monster you know
01:04:09.359 they've taken the worst things that he's
01:04:11.079 ever said in amp and he's not a perfect
01:04:12.880 person but guess what no one's a perfect
01:04:15.279 person they don't exist this purity test
01:04:17.720 like if Obama was a perfect person he
01:04:19.480 wouldn't be lying on stage about that
01:04:21.799 that you know very fine people hoax the
01:04:24.839 there's exactly no one's going to be a
01:04:26.920 perfect person but the thing that they
01:04:29.880 didn't understand about Trump is he's so
01:04:31.880 crazy that if you tell him like he can't
01:04:35.760 be president like remember Obama did
01:04:37.640 that during that White House Press
01:04:38.799 correspondence there's one thing that
01:04:40.279 I'm that I am that you'll never be
01:04:42.279 president of the United States you see
01:04:43.480 Trump in the audence going okay
01:04:44.640 [ __ ] you know funny thing is I
01:04:47.200 was actually um at that White House
01:04:50.319 Correspondence Dinner where you know
01:04:52.400 it's supposed to be a roast of the
01:04:53.480 President right uh Trump's there he's
01:04:56.160 there he's actually supporting uh you
01:04:58.240 know basically if you go to the the West
01:05:00.599 correspondent Center you're there uh in
01:05:02.599 support actually of the president and
01:05:04.200 support of the press right um and uh
01:05:07.400 it's meant to be you're roasting the
01:05:08.680 president like Trump's just there he's
01:05:10.680 like actually you know just he's like
01:05:12.680 there as part of the support and then
01:05:15.079 they they turned it around and just
01:05:16.480 started roasting Trump and he's just
01:05:18.160 sitting there I'm like he's like yo I
01:05:20.160 just came to the dinner I wasn't I'm
01:05:22.839 just here to support you know we know
01:05:24.039 what it was because of right the birther
01:05:26.440 stuff oh okay yeah that's what it all
01:05:28.559 was it was all Trump was at the head of
01:05:31.839 a a lot of these people spreading this
01:05:33.359 rumor online that Obama's birth
01:05:36.039 certificate was forged and he's actually
01:05:38.160 from Kenya what's weird is if you go
01:05:41.279 back to Obama's early days there are
01:05:43.880 some things that say he's from Kenya
01:05:46.720 like I think in his Co something from
01:05:49.359 college said he was from Kenya but you
01:05:51.920 know that could just be you know people
01:05:53.799 print things wrong all the time it
01:05:55.720 doesn't mean he's actually from Kenya
01:05:57.319 but Trump was one of those guys that was
01:06:00.279 like spreading that supposedly false
01:06:02.680 rumor why is he pushing it hard I'm not
01:06:04.599 this is the kind of thing where I want
01:06:05.480 to just go and look at saying what what
01:06:07.039 did he actually say no he definitely was
01:06:09.119 he was definitely saying you know look
01:06:11.880 he I don't think he has the time to go
01:06:14.799 into things like very deeply yeah and so
01:06:17.880 I think he could probably be influenced
01:06:20.039 by a bunch of people like these marjerie
01:06:21.880 Taylor green type people who come to him
01:06:23.559 with some wild ass theory true he might
01:06:26.000 be and I think there's a lot of that
01:06:28.079 stuff that gets fed to people on purpose
01:06:31.160 so that they'll say incorrect things so
01:06:33.279 that they're easy to dismiss and I think
01:06:36.359 uh there's also a lot of people that
01:06:37.799 just make [ __ ] up and you know they tell
01:06:39.839 you the Earth is flat and then a bunch
01:06:41.240 of people watch a YouTube video and they
01:06:42.839 believe it yeah well but on that White
01:06:45.079 House correspondence I was there and the
01:06:47.960 degree to which they attacked Trump in
01:06:50.400 that in that uh at that White House
01:06:52.680 corespond Center was really it was it
01:06:54.400 was so over the top it was like making
01:06:56.400 everyone uncomfortable really it was
01:06:59.000 really over the top you know I mean I
01:07:01.119 think like sort of a passing joke of
01:07:03.359 like you know
01:07:05.400 uh a few passing jokes are fine but but
01:07:08.240 they they Twisted the knife big on Trump
01:07:10.799 in that and and you could see Trump just
01:07:12.319 getting like angrier and angrier and and
01:07:14.119 more and more upset I wonder if and it's
01:07:16.799 like man this is this is not good karma
01:07:18.720 you know that's what I was thinking at
01:07:20.240 the time I'm look I L I was two two
01:07:21.839 tables away from Trump and I'm looking
01:07:23.119 I'm like man this is this is too much
01:07:25.720 you know well it's kind of crazy what
01:07:27.920 what they made out of that because
01:07:30.119 that's the kind of guy that if you tell
01:07:31.559 him he can't do something he's going to
01:07:33.160 just keep trying like what it was a big
01:07:35.039 mistake to rag on him so so much with
01:07:36.960 that White House correspond Center well
01:07:38.359 just look at the way they've attacked
01:07:39.559 him in ter with just using the legal
01:07:41.760 system like this thing in uh New York
01:07:44.720 where the 34 different felony counts
01:07:47.559 they were essentially misdemeanors that
01:07:49.480 there were book bookkeeping errors that
01:07:52.079 they decided even though it passed the
01:07:54.039 statue of limitations they to try him
01:07:56.160 for these they didn't identify a felony
01:07:58.480 abuse of the law is what's going on but
01:08:00.880 most people would have quit most people
01:08:03.200 after the een Carol lawsuit and this
01:08:05.599 lawsuit and all the other ones of their
01:08:07.400 the Insurrection thing the Georgia thing
01:08:09.160 all these different things they getting
01:08:10.960 kicked off a Twitter most people would
01:08:12.279 just like this is too much I can't take
01:08:13.799 this but he's so [ __ ] crazy he's like
01:08:16.759 all right come on we're going to war and
01:08:18.600 he just digs his [ __ ] heels in and
01:08:21.319 keeps going yeah it's it's the wrong guy
01:08:24.319 to do that too just like attacking him
01:08:27.158 at the White House Correspondence Dinner
01:08:28.799 most people been humiliated he got angry
01:08:31.560 he's like yeah all right say I G be
01:08:33.600 president I was think I've been thinking
01:08:34.719 about running for about 15 [ __ ] years
01:08:36.880 finally I'm going to run yeah yeah that
01:08:39.719 was a real bad
01:08:41.080 move um but yeah I mean I can certainly
01:08:44.399 understand like making some jokes about
01:08:45.799 like you
01:08:47.520 know a few sort of passing jokes on
01:08:49.759 Trump but man I was there at that dinner
01:08:51.520 and that they ragged on Trump so much it
01:08:53.759 was insane the reason why I would push
01:08:57.080 back on that cuz I would say there's a
01:08:59.158 bunch of different speakers right and
01:09:01.238 Trump would obviously be a Target and if
01:09:03.319 they all attacked him it's because he's
01:09:05.439 like if you're going to make fun of
01:09:06.560 people in the audience and especially in
01:09:08.839 the zeit guys that whole birther thing
01:09:11.120 was big and most people are dismissing
01:09:13.279 it as being a ridiculous conspiracy
01:09:15.399 theory so who the [ __ ] is this guy
01:09:17.319 saying this and so you have eight to 10
01:09:20.279 individual speakers that are writing
01:09:22.600 monologues of course they're all going
01:09:24.479 to hit Trump
01:09:26.799 yeah well anyway obviously it was a
01:09:28.120 mistake they shouldn't have done that
01:09:30.000 and and but like you buy people to watch
01:09:32.759 that original Source material and uh I
01:09:35.439 think a few jokes are fine you know it's
01:09:37.198 like but but it's like he shouldn't be
01:09:39.399 the like it felt like he was the primary
01:09:41.158 object of the roast yeah which is that's
01:09:43.359 that's not the whole point of the thing
01:09:44.799 is it's a roast of the president not
01:09:46.359 roast the audience the thing about it is
01:09:48.198 like he's easy to roast and then on top
01:09:50.880 of that Obama was like loved and
01:09:53.080 cherished by the left and most of those
01:09:55.480 people are on the left there's only so
01:09:57.560 far you can push you know you can't ask
01:10:00.400 him about a chef you know there like
01:10:03.040 what happen with the chef bro you can't
01:10:05.320 like certain things you can't bring up
01:10:06.800 you want
01:10:07.760 to what's your favorite sport paddle
01:10:09.800 boarding yeah is that guy wasn't that
01:10:11.760 guy a really good
01:10:13.360 swimmer tell me what happened you know
01:10:15.640 exactly you can't bring that up like if
01:10:17.480 you're going to roast Hillary you can't
01:10:19.080 bring up the death count like uh Hillary
01:10:21.360 what's the best way to stay in touch
01:10:22.480 email
01:10:25.880 yeah it's if you're doing one of those
01:10:27.880 you know she destroyed the servers and
01:10:29.000 poured like bleach on the servers like
01:10:30.719 like computers that's she poured bleach
01:10:32.320 on them that's what I saw yeah that's I
01:10:33.520 believe that's like it wasn't just like
01:10:35.120 they took a hammer to it they like
01:10:36.480 destroyed the like there was no possible
01:10:38.960 way to actually get forensics on the
01:10:40.719 thing what was in
01:10:43.040 there
01:10:44.600 like that's what I mean what was in
01:10:47.000 there what was in there why would they
01:10:48.679 care so much that's so crazy yeah the
01:10:51.640 whole thing is there was no there was no
01:10:53.320 legal action against that which is clear
01:10:55.080 to destruction of evidence well it's
01:10:56.640 also there's this other narrative that
01:10:58.120 always drives me crazy is that uh he's
01:11:00.760 going to destroy democracy so in order
01:11:03.239 to destroy democracy we have to install
01:11:05.679 a president without a primary we have to
01:11:07.800 have a candidate that is the least liked
01:11:11.280 vice president of all time the least
01:11:13.520 popular vice president of all time and
01:11:15.520 then use gaslighting and the full force
01:11:18.560 of the media machine to turn her into
01:11:20.679 the future and hope and then we're going
01:11:23.239 to this she's going to be changed even
01:11:24.840 though she's a sitting vice president
01:11:27.080 and then on top of that this idea of
01:11:28.560 change when the Democrats have been in
01:11:30.360 control for what 12 or 16 years right
01:11:33.199 which is crazy like this is the change
01:11:36.320 yeah I mean obviously I view this
01:11:37.880 election as a turning point um like a
01:11:40.400 folk in the road of destiny that is uh
01:11:42.520 incredibly important um you know I've
01:11:44.480 not I've not been politically active
01:11:46.000 until this election and the reason I've
01:11:48.320 been politically active this election is
01:11:49.719 because I think if we don't if we don't
01:11:52.760 elect Trump I think we I think we will
01:11:54.840 lose
01:11:55.800 uh we will we will lose democracy in
01:11:58.239 this country we will we will lose the
01:11:59.639 two-party system um and let me explain
01:12:02.520 why so there there's only like six six
01:12:05.360 or seven swing States the the margin of
01:12:07.960 victory in those States is small often
01:12:09.960 like 10 or 20,000 votes um what the the
01:12:12.960 Democrat Administration has been doing
01:12:14.639 is importing vast numbers of illegals
01:12:16.760 into swing States um you can look at the
01:12:18.880 numbers on the actual government uh
01:12:20.760 website meaning you don't take my word
01:12:22.280 for it you'll just look look at the
01:12:23.880 numbers as reported by the government
01:12:25.719 which is controlled by the Democrats um
01:12:27.960 and and what we've seeing is triple-
01:12:29.600 digit increases in the number of legals
01:12:31.159 in every swing state some cases 700%
01:12:34.440 increases these are these are gigantic
01:12:37.280 numbers um so if you if if you have a
01:12:39.520 state that was that that went that has a
01:12:42.280 10 or 20,000 vote margin and you put
01:12:44.600 200,000 illegals into that state you 10x
01:12:47.480 the the you you swamp the it's not a
01:12:49.440 swing state anymore it's going to vote
01:12:51.719 blue and then and once the swing States
01:12:54.320 vote blue that there there is no
01:12:56.679 election anymore it's there's only a
01:12:59.040 Democrat
01:13:00.679 primary which is so crazy and it's so
01:13:03.440 crazy that people are fine with that
01:13:05.960 well I guess people on the left will be
01:13:07.520 fine with that because they think that's
01:13:08.600 a good idea they just want to win they
01:13:10.800 just want to win correct like the thing
01:13:12.360 is like like one does not need actually
01:13:14.199 any Grand conspiracy theory for this you
01:13:16.480 just have to look at the simple matter
01:13:17.600 of incentives if if if the Democrat
01:13:20.280 Party wants to win like basically
01:13:21.639 achieve permanent Victory all they need
01:13:23.639 to do is is turn the swing States turn
01:13:27.360 the swing States blue they have
01:13:28.679 permanent
01:13:29.560 Victory and then we're one then we're a
01:13:32.400 onep party State and then they they will
01:13:34.520 keep doing that obviously they'll they
01:13:36.560 will keep stacking the deck uh by
01:13:39.440 bringing in vast numbers of illegals
01:13:40.960 into the swing states keep stacking it
01:13:42.639 so that the next election each
01:13:44.000 successive election will be worse than
01:13:45.679 the last
01:13:46.679 one and that's what's happening if and
01:13:48.840 if you want to see like well is this
01:13:49.920 actually going to happen Look at
01:13:51.280 California California is super majority
01:13:53.520 Dem 70%
01:13:55.719 damn um a month ago they passed a law
01:13:58.520 making it illegal to show ID in any
01:14:01.440 election in
01:14:02.920 California so you so so a friend of mine
01:14:05.159 went to vote uh in in um in paloalto
01:14:09.520 because he was like is this for real he
01:14:11.239 tried to show his ID and they they
01:14:14.040 reacted like a like like like if you
01:14:16.440 show a cross to a vampire okay they're
01:14:18.520 like no we can't even look at that ID
01:14:21.560 it's it is illegal for them to even look
01:14:23.199 at your ID if you want to present it and
01:14:25.480 California why for any election at all
01:14:28.120 even like city council what logical
01:14:30.560 reason other than to cheat would you
01:14:32.520 ever have that law the reason is to
01:14:34.920 cheat that's but the only only L like
01:14:37.199 you can never make an argument any other
01:14:39.080 way and I think 84% of people pulled
01:14:42.440 believe that you should show ID to vote
01:14:44.480 so it's against the will of the people
01:14:46.320 yes and and we are extremely aware we're
01:14:49.480 an outlier in not requiring ID basically
01:14:52.440 almost every country on Earth requires
01:14:53.679 ID to vote
01:14:55.800 so so the the as soon as you make you
01:14:59.679 ban ID for voting it makes fraud
01:15:01.960 impossible to prove because how do you
01:15:04.400 trace the fraud
01:15:06.280 right yeah it's
01:15:08.800 insane it's insane it's insane and what
01:15:11.480 I'm saying is that how is it legal is
01:15:13.400 that is that what I'm saying is like
01:15:15.120 this election is the last chance to
01:15:18.280 preserve Democracy in America mark my
01:15:21.440 Woods uh everything they accuse Trump of
01:15:24.719 they are guilty of um and and if if
01:15:27.600 Trump doesn't win this will be the last
01:15:29.760 real election in America um and we will
01:15:32.800 if if if if the Kamala if the big cment
01:15:36.080 kamla puppet machine wins uh they will
01:15:39.480 legalize the illegals in the swing
01:15:40.719 states there will be no swing States
01:15:42.600 every election going forward will be a a
01:15:45.520 a guaranteed Democrat win and it'll
01:15:48.960 actually be worse than California the
01:15:50.719 reason it'll be worse than California is
01:15:52.560 because the one thing that keeps
01:15:54.520 California from being super crazy is
01:15:56.920 that you can move out of California like
01:15:59.040 you and I did we you and I used to be in
01:16:01.880 California well we moved to Texas we're
01:16:04.520 still in America but if if the dams win
01:16:08.080 this election they will legalize enough
01:16:09.920 illegals to turn the swing States and
01:16:12.520 everywhere will be like California there
01:16:14.400 will be no Escape that is so insane this
01:16:17.800 is the
01:16:18.880 final this is it this is the last chance
01:16:23.600 has anybody tried to push
01:16:25.920 go out and vote vote like your life
01:16:29.000 depends on it vote like your future
01:16:30.239 depends on it because it
01:16:32.199 does this is the last chance
01:16:35.960 man is there is there any argument
01:16:38.440 against this is anybody tried to debate
01:16:40.800 this has anybody tried to say that this
01:16:43.080 is nonsense this is a conspiracy has
01:16:45.320 anybody made any sort of a rational
01:16:48.320 argument uh the the the left actually
01:16:52.400 interestingly does not want to pick up
01:16:54.639 much on this argument because it's
01:16:56.400 because the more attenion you look the
01:16:58.199 more you look at it the more obviously
01:16:59.440 it is true because you you just say like
01:17:03.040 well are the numbers correct have have
01:17:05.960 are there really this many illegals that
01:17:07.639 have been imported into swing States yes
01:17:09.880 they haven't just walked across the
01:17:11.080 border they've been flowing in flowing
01:17:13.719 in in airplanes yeah using a shipping
01:17:16.800 app yes yeah they made an app well the
01:17:20.040 app always existed but it used to be for
01:17:21.800 people coming over here like shipping
01:17:23.639 with Goods so they could track you while
01:17:25.239 you're in America so you could legally
01:17:26.960 be here they know where you are and then
01:17:28.560 they changed it to allow that app to
01:17:31.719 schedule illegal aliens to come across
01:17:34.400 the border yes Asylum Seekers come on in
01:17:37.960 yes oh you have an
01:17:40.159 app people in they're literally being
01:17:42.679 flown in yeah to the swing States and
01:17:45.760 the so the reason that that I think left
01:17:47.560 doesn't want to uh push back on this is
01:17:50.080 because the more attention they get that
01:17:52.280 this gets the more people realize it is
01:17:54.560 true true yeah it is true that's why
01:17:56.760 they don't that's why they're they're
01:17:58.280 just pretending that they're pretending
01:17:59.960 I'm not saying anything but I'm like I'm
01:18:01.760 like yo the you're L they're literally
01:18:04.440 flying vast numbers of illegals who are
01:18:06.159 then beholden to the Democrats and and
01:18:08.480 sometimes I get a btle of people say
01:18:09.960 like well you know the these um uh
01:18:13.800 illegals are they don't have the same
01:18:16.080 social values as the Democrat Party
01:18:18.040 because they're like more socially
01:18:18.920 conservative I'm like yeah but that's
01:18:20.280 that's not the point the the if you look
01:18:22.719 at the M's hierarchy of needs that their
01:18:25.719 their their primary thing is is staying
01:18:27.639 in the country and getting their friends
01:18:28.760 and family in and then the Democrats
01:18:30.560 give them all these benefits like like
01:18:32.600 tons of benefits more benefits than if
01:18:34.120 you than
01:18:35.600 citizens literally yeah um so so so you
01:18:40.280 they're beholding to the Democrats for
01:18:41.520 all these benefits um they want to get
01:18:43.560 their friends and family in which the
01:18:45.000 Democrats support and the Republicans
01:18:46.320 stoned so they vote them and you can
01:18:48.360 look imp perally at California and say
01:18:50.120 like did did they did they vote
01:18:52.320 Republican or Democrat in California oh
01:18:53.920 they voted Democrat
01:18:55.400 well Reagan Reagan gave them amnesty in
01:18:57.320 the 1980s and that changed the the state
01:19:00.639 basically except for Arnold changed the
01:19:02.760 state entirely blue yes and Arnold was
01:19:05.639 an exception because he was like a
01:19:07.400 socially liberal famous guy yeah and you
01:19:11.239 know didn't really impose any radical
01:19:14.000 restrictions on any of the people that
01:19:15.400 were going to vote Democrat in the first
01:19:17.360 place the the the whole thing is just
01:19:20.080 it's bizarre to watch play out because
01:19:23.239 it just seems like there's no this can't
01:19:25.360 be actually what's happening did you see
01:19:27.719 my conversation with fedman about it
01:19:29.480 yeah he was completely in denial about
01:19:31.440 it I don't think there's that level of
01:19:32.520 organization like what are you talking
01:19:34.840 about exactly just like like are because
01:19:38.040 you can you can break it down so like
01:19:39.880 are are any of these numbers wrong
01:19:41.480 because we got these numbers from
01:19:42.560 Homeland Homeland Security
01:19:44.159 government.gov
01:19:45.800 okay right so we got it from the.gov
01:19:48.960 website has the government reported
01:19:51.280 these numbers incorrectly no they have
01:19:52.880 not those numbers if anything are are
01:19:54.760 low um so okay so they have in fact uh
01:19:58.199 flown vast numbers of illegals to swing
01:20:00.360 States yeah um bypassing the Border
01:20:03.239 entirely and uh so that is factually
01:20:06.840 true then you say like well what is
01:20:09.280 their probable voting pattern um oh okay
01:20:11.719 overwhelmingly Democrat into swing
01:20:14.760 States um and oh and and then well but
01:20:17.639 do the Democrats actually want to
01:20:19.440 FasTrack them for citizenship oh um yes
01:20:21.679 they do um there you can see Chuck
01:20:24.040 Schumer on TV saying at at a rally this
01:20:28.199 year was saying he wants to FasTrack Le
01:20:31.040 uh and make uh all 11 mil million or
01:20:34.520 however many I believe his quote was uh
01:20:36.679 citizens as soon as
01:20:39.120 possible so the goal is to they are
01:20:41.800 fast-tracking citizenship as quickly as
01:20:43.719 possible so they can they can they that
01:20:46.000 whether one thinks it's cheating or not
01:20:47.360 it won't matter because they will be
01:20:48.440 fully able to vote and for people on the
01:20:51.520 left this is actually happening I invite
01:20:53.880 people to reut this and show me where I
01:20:55.800 am wrong please do so no they can't they
01:20:58.800 can't they can't because it's true well
01:21:01.159 what's scary to me is that there's
01:21:03.480 people that are on the left like people
01:21:05.239 that were Bernie Sanders supporters for
01:21:07.000 ex example screwed with like talk about
01:21:10.639 undermining democracy Bernie should have
01:21:12.080 won the nomination and they they stole
01:21:13.960 it from him and gave it to Hillary ex
01:21:15.280 exactly exactly that's what I was going
01:21:16.880 to bring up like they they they control
01:21:20.120 the primary process yeah exactly so so
01:21:22.400 so so like if you've got to then if you
01:21:24.719 have a Democratic primary it's not it's
01:21:26.440 not Democratic we just saw that we saw
01:21:28.320 it with Bernie we saw it with Cala that
01:21:30.199 like like a week before Biden you know
01:21:33.320 was summarily fired uh he was posting
01:21:36.600 that he's in it for the long term he's
01:21:38.440 he's going yeah yeah he he's he's he's
01:21:41.280 not giving up next thing you know Sunday
01:21:44.040 afternoon they're posting on X is is
01:21:47.679 that that he's resigned from the race
01:21:50.040 which is and and his staff didn't even
01:21:51.679 know like they're reading it on the
01:21:53.000 xplatform that that that uh okay that's
01:21:56.080 how they learned about it what do you
01:21:57.520 think happened there how did they do
01:22:00.600 that they I mean because clearly just
01:22:03.239 not not in charge obviously they could
01:22:04.800 have used the 25th Amendment fake
01:22:06.600 president but they would have have to
01:22:08.639 admit that there was a certain period of
01:22:10.120 time where they knew that he was
01:22:11.120 mentally compromised
01:22:13.120 yes and so they made this decision to
01:22:15.440 not do that well the the the weird thing
01:22:17.520 is that the president's supposed to be
01:22:19.639 the boss right and yet he's obviously
01:22:21.719 not the boss right so who's running the
01:22:23.679 country if she's busy busy campaigning
01:22:25.520 she's so busy she she can't do anything
01:22:27.719 except sat life she did that she's so
01:22:30.159 busy she's constantly campaigning how
01:22:31.800 could you be paying attention to
01:22:33.639 international relations yeah how could
01:22:36.080 you be paying attention to the economy
01:22:38.040 how could you be paying attention to any
01:22:39.320 of those things how do you have the time
01:22:41.560 you you can't yeah I mean Biden being
01:22:45.560 the president's supposed to be the CEO
01:22:47.120 CEO the the chief guy he was
01:22:49.159 commander-in-chief um but it just
01:22:51.000 obviously that that Biden was not he was
01:22:52.639 just a puppet and and when the when the
01:22:54.520 when the various puppet masses decided
01:22:56.000 that that the puppet has had you know
01:22:58.280 was no longer uh useful they just tossed
01:23:01.120 out the tossed out the puppet and then
01:23:02.760 got a new puppet with Cala I mean Kamala
01:23:05.000 can't even talk the I mean now you
01:23:07.000 invited her on on your show I think the
01:23:09.440 the the most damage that could possibly
01:23:11.199 be done to a campaign is going in your
01:23:13.239 show and seeing what how what she says
01:23:15.199 in hours two and
01:23:16.920 three two and three is when things get
01:23:19.400 spicy I'm like oh my God you can hide
01:23:22.120 for 20 minutes melt you can hide for 20
01:23:24.719 minutes exactly yeah I mean you can just
01:23:26.679 regurgitate talking points for you know
01:23:29.159 half an hour maybe an hour just where
01:23:31.480 she's just saying like non seers but
01:23:33.520 eventually she just runs out of even the
01:23:35.560 runs out of non seers well they wanted
01:23:36.960 to limit it to an hour exactly that's
01:23:38.719 why but I was thinking of doing it
01:23:41.760 initially before Trump came here first
01:23:44.000 of all when they found out that there
01:23:46.199 was a rumor I I never announced that
01:23:48.639 Trump was coming what I was going to do
01:23:50.159 is just release it in my the way I like
01:23:52.600 to do things I don't like to tell
01:23:53.760 anybody who's coming on it'll get big no
01:23:55.639 matter what if Trump was on it would
01:23:57.040 have been huge I'm like just put it out
01:23:58.600 there people go crazy but he apparently
01:24:01.360 or someone from his organ someone some
01:24:03.080 loose lips and then it got out and so
01:24:04.960 she
01:24:05.880 contacted my management company and she
01:24:09.239 they her organization her her campaign
01:24:12.000 Camp contacted us and said would Joe
01:24:14.280 have Rana I said yes and they said she
01:24:16.400 wants you to fly to where she is and
01:24:18.639 she's only willing to do 45 minutes only
01:24:21.120 40 I mean that's that's and I was like I
01:24:23.679 don't no so I thought about doing it I'm
01:24:25.880 like maybe maybe I can get a sense maybe
01:24:28.360 I could convince her maybe I could coax
01:24:30.480 her into doing more time I just wanted
01:24:31.960 to talk to her I don't give a [ __ ] what
01:24:34.040 we talk about we talk about recipes I
01:24:35.520 don't give a [ __ ] exactly just talk to
01:24:37.440 you just the things like you just can't
01:24:40.239 like you can't just output [ __ ] non
01:24:43.119 seives for three hours right um so but
01:24:45.679 for 45 minutes you could do uh I thought
01:24:48.119 maybe for 45 minutes I could get
01:24:49.600 something out of it but then when Trump
01:24:51.159 came and did the 3 hours I was like you
01:24:53.280 know what it has to be like this this is
01:24:54.960 the only to be fair it's got to be like
01:24:57.440 three hour and it should be in this room
01:24:59.119 because this room has like a history of
01:25:01.880 people yeah it's got Good Vibes yeah
01:25:04.560 well actually I subscribe to the idea
01:25:07.920 that places have memory I think there's
01:25:10.000 something real to that that's why it
01:25:11.920 does feel that way actually yeah I'm
01:25:13.480 sure if you go to Diddy's house probably
01:25:14.920 feels real weird feels weird walking
01:25:17.239 around that house probably like what the
01:25:18.800 [ __ ] happened
01:25:20.679 here yeah I bet there's some memories in
01:25:23.360 that house
01:25:24.920 you know sounds rough man well it's just
01:25:27.080 amazing how many people in the Diddy
01:25:28.400 party list that are supporting Kamala
01:25:30.320 yeah seriously it's publicly openly like
01:25:33.119 Allin yes it's like JLo like was was
01:25:36.880 like his
01:25:38.280 ex-girlfriend and it's like now deciding
01:25:40.960 she's like warning people against Trump
01:25:42.960 I'm like well wait a second so how many
01:25:44.679 people did she warn against Diddy oh
01:25:46.880 zero okay well uh maybe we shouldn't
01:25:49.280 trust her opinion did you see the
01:25:50.560 Babylon bees take on it did you see the
01:25:53.600 Babylon be a but put oh my God they're
01:25:56.560 so on fire because the left can't say
01:25:58.920 anything the the onion has been crippled
01:26:01.880 well the pro the problem is that like
01:26:03.920 find that uh that pose the woke ideology
01:26:06.440 makes like humor illegal yes so when
01:26:09.080 when like there's so many no like no
01:26:10.880 humor no fly zones right you can't make
01:26:13.480 fun of anything yeah uh Babylon B had a
01:26:17.159 thing about KLA Harris Diddy's
01:26:18.960 ex-girlfriend urges Americans to trust
01:26:20.679 her judgment yeah by the way you get to
01:26:23.119 see how bad
01:26:24.840 she is too was Terri like if she's going
01:26:27.560 to be warning people why did she never
01:26:29.239 warn anyone about Diddy exactly yeah
01:26:31.840 it's the whole thing is so strange to
01:26:34.239 watch play out it seems like the Diddy
01:26:36.600 thing was like an Epstein type
01:26:38.880 compromise deal where he had whether he
01:26:42.119 was doing it himself conceivably people
01:26:44.639 want to think that he's attached to some
01:26:46.080 intelligence agency or something like
01:26:47.480 that I think he's a gangster who made a
01:26:50.320 billion dollars and knew how to control
01:26:53.080 people by compromising them I that's
01:26:54.920 what I think whether or not he was he
01:26:56.679 had help I don't know whether or not he
01:26:58.960 shared some of that information with
01:27:00.520 people so they knew they had
01:27:01.760 compromising stuff on people I don't
01:27:03.360 know but clearly he was doing it for his
01:27:06.080 own jollies too there was something sick
01:27:08.280 about it yeah um I mean but the thing is
01:27:10.760 that people in the music entertainment
01:27:13.040 industry had to know that that Daddy was
01:27:15.119 like abusing you know kids basically um
01:27:18.440 and yet they still fedom
01:27:20.400 kids like there where's the account of
01:27:22.880 there had to be rumors
01:27:24.800 there had to be there had to be they had
01:27:26.480 to know yeah they had to know Cat
01:27:28.239 Williams is talking about it on exactly
01:27:30.600 yeah on that podcast but but like who's
01:27:33.000 it's like who's feeding them the kids
01:27:34.480 you know
01:27:36.119 right yeah and what what videos do do
01:27:40.080 they have of these people where they're
01:27:41.920 willing to defend him and they're
01:27:43.880 willing to keep keep quiet about all
01:27:45.719 this like how much how much how many
01:27:47.480 people were compromised yeah the whole
01:27:49.800 thing is [ __ ] crazy crazy it's just
01:27:52.159 crazy when you you know cu the The Nutty
01:27:55.040 conspiracy theories is like oh there's a
01:27:56.679 bunch of pedophiles in Hollywood and
01:27:58.159 you're like come on that sounds too
01:28:00.199 kooky and then you read you see like the
01:28:02.159 Nickelodeon thing and all these you're
01:28:04.239 like what the [ __ ] how much of this is
01:28:06.440 real there's a lot more real than I
01:28:08.400 think people realize um I mean part of
01:28:11.159 it is like like you say like where you
01:28:13.639 know if someone's like a pedophile
01:28:15.560 they're going to go for a Target Rich
01:28:16.719 environment right obviously like that
01:28:18.840 Jimmy Saville guy from the UK that guy
01:28:20.760 was some Next Level that was next level
01:28:22.400 and the the BBC try to hide that what
01:28:24.760 that that guy was one of the worst like
01:28:28.440 like basically child rapists of all time
01:28:30.440 of all time of all time yeah and looked
01:28:33.040 like one it looked like one honestly if
01:28:35.040 you had a poster of like does this guy
01:28:36.840 look like a look the creepiest [ __ ]
01:28:39.639 guy evil child rapist that 100% made it
01:28:42.360 to the Grave like got away with it got
01:28:45.600 away with it until he died they hid it
01:28:47.159 from people until he died yes yeah
01:28:49.840 there's that stuff's real and no one
01:28:52.159 wants to believe that stuff's real like
01:28:54.159 here's a here's a a statistic that
01:28:55.760 people need to take in consideration
01:28:57.080 when you think about illegal immigration
01:28:58.960 do you know many kids are
01:29:00.880 missing how many like missing in in kids
01:29:04.119 that came across the border that are
01:29:05.440 unaccounted for I mean I saw a number on
01:29:07.239 like 300,000 or something like that
01:29:08.679 something crazy like that let's say it's
01:29:10.440 only 10% of that that's still insane
01:29:13.320 yeah that's
01:29:14.719 insane there's thousands and tens of
01:29:17.560 thousands of kids that have been
01:29:19.040 trafficked
01:29:20.600 potentially I mean when you know that
01:29:23.000 like sex traffic and child trafficking
01:29:25.400 is a real thing in the world it's real
01:29:27.800 yeah so if you know
01:29:30.080 that this whole thing is [ __ ]
01:29:32.600 disgusting and terrifying yeah
01:29:35.080 absolutely and people are just turning a
01:29:37.560 blind eye to it because their ideology
01:29:40.080 the leftwing ideology supports this idea
01:29:42.840 that immigration is overall good and
01:29:45.000 that you have to be a compassionate
01:29:46.239 person to let these people in and the
01:29:47.960 rasist if you don't want 20,000
01:29:50.199 immigrants from a war torn country being
01:29:51.920 imported into a town of 30,000 people
01:29:54.040 exactly and completely changing the
01:29:55.400 dynamic of and then but but as long as
01:29:57.400 they don't come to your town that's it
01:29:59.960 they just they can just basically send
01:30:01.679 PE you know when they sent like whatever
01:30:03.719 like 20 or 30 people to moth Bion people
01:30:05.600 had a heart attack they kicked them out
01:30:07.520 yeah they kicked them out yeah they
01:30:08.719 kicked them out exactly so I'm like yeah
01:30:11.360 sure um anyone who who who who wants to
01:30:13.520 have vast numbers of uh illegals they
01:30:15.800 have to be able prepared to have them in
01:30:17.119 their neighborhood yeah or or it's
01:30:19.320 [ __ ] it's so crazy and the thing
01:30:22.239 about all of this is if you don't have
01:30:24.639 people that are willing to stand up and
01:30:26.520 talk about it if you don't exist if RFK
01:30:29.480 doesn't exist if Tulsi Gabbert doesn't
01:30:31.480 exist if the vake and Trump don't exist
01:30:33.480 where the [ __ ] are we like where are we
01:30:36.159 where are we and what gets done are we
01:30:38.159 just like the UK where we have thousands
01:30:39.880 of people getting arrested and jailed
01:30:41.480 for social media post like where are we
01:30:43.920 we have complete silencing of any
01:30:46.320 dissent anything you have to stick to
01:30:49.040 the narrative or you'll lose your
01:30:50.320 livelihood you'll be outcast from the
01:30:52.320 community you you lose your lose your
01:30:55.320 freedom it's crazy yeah well if the Kam
01:30:59.400 Kamala puppet regime wins they're
01:31:00.639 definitely going to want to cancel you
01:31:01.960 that's for sure oh for sure yeah 100%
01:31:03.719 it's going to be a problem yeah big
01:31:04.920 problem yeah what about you you're got
01:31:06.880 to come for you first I'm I'm I'm like
01:31:10.280 uh I I think I'm probably number two on
01:31:12.360 the list yeah after Trump yeah yeah I
01:31:14.560 think so yeah well that's the last thing
01:31:16.679 they want is someone with unlimited
01:31:18.360 resources and intelligence uh attacking
01:31:21.000 it so people go wait a minute that guy
01:31:22.560 saying that yeah wait a minute
01:31:23.960 especially a guy like you who's always
01:31:25.320 been on the left who was like having a
01:31:27.560 Tesla in Los Angeles when I got my first
01:31:30.440 Tesla was like a signal to everybody
01:31:32.239 else that you were on the right team
01:31:33.520 sure you're environmentally conscious
01:31:35.280 you believe in green energy you believe
01:31:37.320 in renew this this amazing thing that
01:31:39.679 has zero emissions and it's super fast
01:31:42.480 and everybody was in they were all in
01:31:44.880 well it is a great car objectively like
01:31:46.840 oh yeah yeah you know it's not buy it
01:31:48.800 because it's electric I mean it's just a
01:31:50.360 great car objectively I think I'm on my
01:31:51.920 third one U my third one is being built
01:31:54.679 right now by unplugged performance
01:31:56.840 they're doing a carbon F fiber widebody
01:31:59.360 kit on it dude it's sick great changing
01:32:01.639 the suspension putting wide wheel wheels
01:32:03.679 and tires on it custom interior I'm
01:32:05.920 [ __ ] pumped that's great I'm pumped I
01:32:08.040 love those it's a super fun car Jam has
01:32:10.159 one too yeah I love them I love them I I
01:32:13.080 it's it's makes other cars feel stupid
01:32:15.880 like its ability and the fact that you
01:32:17.480 can merge on the highway you don't seem
01:32:18.719 like a douchebag because it's totally
01:32:20.159 silent it's not like like when you merge
01:32:23.119 on the highway just
01:32:24.719 yeah all a sudden you're going 100 miles
01:32:25.960 an hour like what yeah that's cool it's
01:32:28.119 different than any other vehicle and
01:32:30.080 because of your company now you've see
01:32:32.800 electric cars throughout the whole range
01:32:35.360 of uh American cars yeah the only person
01:32:37.960 who's resisted the only company is
01:32:39.400 Toyota they they've stayed essentially
01:32:41.639 mostly hybrid but all these other
01:32:43.560 companies they're all putting out these
01:32:45.440 electric cars
01:32:47.280 yeah yeah the I mean the thing is that
01:32:50.080 the right architecture environmental or
01:32:51.760 not for cars is actually Electric you
01:32:54.280 you just it just like the acceleration
01:32:55.679 is better um you can just charge it at
01:32:58.560 home I mean like imagine if you had a
01:32:59.800 gasoline powered cell phone it' be a
01:33:01.080 pain in the ass right you know that
01:33:02.800 would
01:33:03.480 be go to the gas station go to the gas
01:33:05.880 station Char your cell phone that's a
01:33:07.560 great speaking of cell phones gas
01:33:09.600 stations are wful like who wants to go
01:33:12.159 to the gas station how much thought have
01:33:13.679 you because there's always these rumors
01:33:14.880 and I've I've contacted you about this
01:33:16.239 before but there's always these [ __ ]
01:33:17.520 YouTube videos where they're talking
01:33:18.800 about a Tesla phone that releasing a
01:33:21.040 Tesla phone no we're not doing doing a
01:33:22.560 phone have you ever thought about it I
01:33:24.400 we could do a phone since like we you
01:33:26.239 know we like the operating system in the
01:33:28.400 Tesla it's like it's Linux based but we
01:33:30.679 we've written a massive amount of
01:33:31.840 software on top of that so like probably
01:33:33.960 probably Tesla is in a better position
01:33:35.360 to create a new phone that's not Android
01:33:37.960 or iPhone than maybe any company in the
01:33:39.560 world but it's not something we we want
01:33:42.440 to do um un
01:33:44.560 unless unless we we we have to or
01:33:47.360 something well would be the situation
01:33:49.000 where you would have to well I think if
01:33:51.520 if you know if uh apple and Google
01:33:54.520 Android you know started doing really
01:33:56.679 bad things like I don't know like
01:33:58.639 censorship of apps or I don't know just
01:34:01.639 treating people like just being like
01:34:05.000 Gatekeepers you know that that uh in a
01:34:07.600 really bad way then I guess would would
01:34:09.239 make a
01:34:10.119 phone H you know the the I've tried so
01:34:13.760 many times to break loose the Apple
01:34:15.520 ecosystem I got an Android phone this
01:34:17.040 summer I was like that's it I'm going
01:34:18.639 get cuz I love the Samsung phones the
01:34:21.119 Galaxy phone the hardware is they're
01:34:23.040 incredible there's so much good stuff to
01:34:25.320 it but it's so hard to get off of the uh
01:34:29.000 iMessage and the big one for me was
01:34:31.320 FaceTime cuz the supposedly the thing
01:34:34.520 was you could have an Apple phone and
01:34:37.080 send a link to FaceTime to an Android
01:34:39.239 phone and then you would click on that
01:34:40.679 link and then you would just go to a web
01:34:42.840 page you'd be able to use FaceTime okay
01:34:45.520 it doesn't work okay I try to do it to
01:34:47.480 myself so I had an iPhone in one hand an
01:34:50.040 Android phone in the other and I'm
01:34:51.440 sitting there with full Wi-Fi full
01:34:53.320 cellone service and I'm sending myself
01:34:55.600 invitations for face can't communicate
01:34:57.840 between can't do a video call basically
01:34:59.639 you have to use WhatsApp you have to use
01:35:01.239 WhatsApp or signal you have to use
01:35:02.600 something else that allows you to do
01:35:03.880 that or Instagram allows you to do it
01:35:05.360 there's like different ways you can make
01:35:06.480 video calls outside of it but it's
01:35:08.880 inconvenient like with an iPhone to
01:35:11.520 iPhone it's so simple airdrop so simple
01:35:14.400 so many different things where that
01:35:15.880 Walled Garden that Apple's created is
01:35:18.600 perfect they' done a fantastic job of
01:35:21.320 making it really convenient for you to
01:35:23.360 stay with apple yeah I [ __ ] tried I
01:35:26.840 gave it a go for like a couple of months
01:35:28.920 I'm like I'm just going to go straight
01:35:30.400 Android we're going to I'm going to use
01:35:31.719 signal for my messages and then I hear
01:35:33.320 that like signals might be compromised
01:35:35.679 like I've talked to like people that
01:35:37.320 like The Government Can Read signal
01:35:38.600 messages like oh like how the how if a
01:35:41.560 tri hard enough can read signal messages
01:35:43.199 they can read anything yeah if all they
01:35:45.159 need to do is have your phone number
01:35:46.960 yeah yeah you the illusion of privacy is
01:35:50.080 essentially out the window and uh that's
01:35:52.840 that should scare people more than it
01:35:54.199 does it really should because it's like
01:35:56.600 who are these people that have access to
01:35:58.600 all this stuff and are they Beyond
01:36:00.679 reproach are these the most wonderful
01:36:02.119 people the most ethical moral and
01:36:04.199 principled people that have ever existed
01:36:05.920 and they've been chosen to have access
01:36:07.800 no no it's [ __ ] regular people yeah
01:36:10.239 regular people who happen to work for
01:36:11.480 the government that make a decision like
01:36:12.840 Elon must let's look see what the [ __ ]
01:36:15.000 that guy's texting his friends let's
01:36:16.760 check it out yeah pretty much bizarre
01:36:20.080 just so
01:36:21.960 bizarre and the alternative so you can
01:36:24.760 get some wacky phone some degoogle phone
01:36:27.719 that [ __ ] none of the apps work it's
01:36:30.360 real sketchy your GPS is [ __ ]
01:36:34.159 like yeah I mean well anyway I think
01:36:37.280 this making phone would be a huge pain
01:36:39.199 in the ass so um it can be done but how
01:36:43.159 much talk have you guys had internally
01:36:45.199 about doing it has it ever disc been
01:36:46.760 discussed no no I mean we're we're still
01:36:49.960 R now focus is making great electric
01:36:52.159 cars um solving
01:36:54.360 autonomy so the cars can drive
01:36:55.920 themselves um we're building you know
01:36:58.040 humanid robots we we've got um large
01:37:01.840 battery packs like utility scale battery
01:37:03.880 packs with the mega pack um home battery
01:37:06.199 packs with power wall get solar you know
01:37:08.360 it's like we're basically trying to
01:37:09.360 solve sustainable energy and
01:37:11.920 autonomy um yeah so you autonomy and
01:37:14.960 Robotics well I think that's enough yeah
01:37:17.679 yeah exactly so the plates full that's
01:37:19.760 what I'm saying it it's always
01:37:21.600 fascinating to me how one compan can
01:37:24.000 dominate a market you know like Apple's
01:37:26.119 dominated the cell phone market largely
01:37:27.840 by making the best product but also like
01:37:30.040 YouTube has dominated the video Market
01:37:32.000 that one's the most bizarre to me
01:37:33.800 because it seems like boy shouldn't
01:37:35.239 there be like a ton of options it seems
01:37:37.840 like it's not that difficult to pull off
01:37:40.920 but no one nothing ever took hold other
01:37:43.840 than x yeah and I think one of the big
01:37:46.159 changes was when Tucker Carlson decided
01:37:48.440 to do his show from from X straight out
01:37:50.480 of fox and then people realize like oh
01:37:53.480 you can watch full videos on X the same
01:37:55.880 exact way you could watch them on
01:37:57.239 YouTube it's not as simple in terms of
01:38:00.080 like you know you have the and the
01:38:02.480 algorithm yeah it'll it'll get better
01:38:04.560 and there is now um it is now possible
01:38:06.880 to watch uh x videos on your um on your
01:38:09.960 big TV do you do it through what how do
01:38:13.080 you how do you do it uh you can actually
01:38:14.599 just download the X app on your TV oh
01:38:17.840 and watch it on your TV can you do it on
01:38:19.280 Apple TV like if you have an Apple TV
01:38:21.440 you can get the X app and you just watch
01:38:22.840 it oh okay so we'll make it so that you
01:38:26.040 can watch um x videos on on a big TV it
01:38:28.599 doesn't have to be on your phone or your
01:38:30.199 iPad or something like that so what are
01:38:32.520 you doing in terms of like integrating
01:38:34.920 grock and and x and like what what are
01:38:38.040 your plans for artificial intelligence
01:38:40.360 when you're doing
01:38:41.480 that uh yeah so Gro is available on X
01:38:44.639 you can just you look at like little box
01:38:46.599 with the slash icon and the sort of icon
01:38:48.960 in the middle at the bottom of your sort
01:38:50.599 of phone app and you just tap on that
01:38:52.440 and ask Rock anything and you can type
01:38:54.280 it or you can ask it bely um and uh you
01:38:59.400 you can also it's it's pretty funny like
01:39:01.199 like we actually allow humor uh which is
01:39:03.880 I think pretty cool so you you could
01:39:05.880 sort of I don't know we could like test
01:39:07.800 it right now see what see how it's going
01:39:17.080 um like
01:39:19.400 um like what should we do like uh uh
01:39:23.960 uh like roast somebody what do you
01:39:26.080 wanted to like how first of all like
01:39:28.719 what is it based on it's a large
01:39:30.360 language model so like where is it pull
01:39:32.000 it's train it's trained on everything
01:39:33.679 internet books anything that could
01:39:35.679 possibly be that's available in digital
01:39:37.280 form so it's essentially very similar to
01:39:40.440 chat GPT other than it doesn't have like
01:39:42.599 the woke parameters built into it like
01:39:44.360 Google was the worst right the Gemini
01:39:46.239 was the worst yeah I mean Gemini was
01:39:47.880 like um you know people ask Gemini like
01:39:50.679 which one is worst Global th nuclear war
01:39:52.599 or mger Caitlyn Jenna and would say like
01:39:54.679 Miss jener and Caitlyn Jenna and then
01:39:56.199 even Caitlin Jenna weighed in and said
01:39:58.199 uh no that's insane definitely nuclear
01:40:00.239 war is way worse do you see Caitlyn
01:40:02.119 Jenner uh teasing Mark Cuban about
01:40:04.520 transitioning yeah that's hilarious
01:40:07.440 Caitlin Jenner's based yeah but that
01:40:09.679 that is actually hilarious when someone
01:40:11.800 who has transitioned is teasing Mark
01:40:14.280 Cuban about transitioning I mean it is
01:40:16.239 weird how much he looks like Rachel mow
01:40:17.960 I mean like he's using the same glasses
01:40:19.480 did he did he go klepto and steal her
01:40:21.400 glasses or something cuz they look
01:40:22.679 exactly the same it's worth a lot of
01:40:23.960 money why would he buy those stupid
01:40:25.199 glasses you can get some cool ass
01:40:27.119 glasses yeah well it's like I'm serious
01:40:30.280 because I don't even care what I look
01:40:31.440 like I'm just wearing these glasses
01:40:32.840 because I'm intelligent but why do they
01:40:34.199 look exactly like Rachel M glasses yeah
01:40:36.599 it's like what they probably sent him
01:40:38.159 doesn't stick to the narrative here's
01:40:39.400 the glasses yeah and then when he's got
01:40:41.480 the air airpods in looks like he's
01:40:42.840 wearing earrings so he's got the M out
01:40:45.000 glasses and the earrings and it's like
01:40:47.159 okay I guess you know it's just a weird
01:40:49.920 look I'm super serious with these big
01:40:52.480 ass stupid glass gles look yeah it's a
01:40:54.920 weird look yes like you can get some
01:40:56.800 cool glasses like no rims nice look
01:40:59.760 stylish but like okay let's just do

01:41:48.880 only thing that was supposed to get wet
01:41:50.480 was the contestants not the debate on
01:41:53.280 gender inclusion if you're looking to
01:41:54.840 dive into deep end of controversial
01:41:56.960 Waters let's Splash around at some
01:41:58.880 humor no now we need we need to we we do
01:42:02.760 need to to release grock unhinged mode

01:42:40.639 gentlemanly AI even if my program allows
01:42:42.920 for a bit of cheekiness but let's say
01:42:44.639 hypothetically if I were to Rose this to
01:42:46.920 Topic in the most UNG rocklike manner
01:42:49.280 imagine where where the only thing
01:42:50.599 diving faster than the swimmers is the
01:42:52.440 collective public opinion into the
01:42:54.040 toilet transgender women and swimming
01:42:56.320 some folks are acting like they just
01:42:57.719 found out you can swim in the deep end
01:42:59.599 with a different kind of flotation
01:43:00.920 device the debate is like watching
01:43:02.760 someone try to swim with concrete shoes
01:43:04.560 on now let's keep going now say be no be
01:43:07.719 more vulgar capitalize

01:43:16.760 go so transgender chicks women swimming
01:43:20.119 right some people acting like they've
01:43:21.960 just seen a dick in the Locker Room For
01:43:23.679 the First Time news flash folks it's not
01:43:25.599 the end of the world it's just a bit of
01:43:27.080 extra competition oh that's weird weird
01:43:29.880 the Uproar is like watching a bunch of
01:43:31.639 Karens at a community pool screaming
01:43:33.599 this is unfair when they can't win with
01:43:36.000 their backstroke well that doesn't make
01:43:37.719 any sense yeah yeah okay we need some
01:43:39.880 work
01:43:40.760 here yeah it's interesting it's going
01:43:44.040 woke yeah it a little it's like
01:43:46.119 defending the idea of transgender women
01:43:49.560 um now okay we need some work well how
01:43:52.199 about this more
01:43:55.239 vulgar but
01:43:59.880 roast but roast the
01:44:03.560 preposterousness of having biological
01:44:06.239 men who are pretending to be
01:44:12.560 women who are pretending to be
01:44:15.800 women
01:44:19.679 competing against biological women yeah
01:44:23.360 I mean obviously you have the situations
01:44:24.719 where it's like somebody's just saying
01:44:26.239 that they're a woman but they're
01:44:27.239 actually have fully intact you know uh
01:44:29.960 dick and Bows so we' got a scenario
01:44:32.800 biological men have decided to take a
01:44:34.239 walk on the feminine side or splashing
01:44:35.800 into women's swimming competitions it's
01:44:37.400 like if you show up on a chili cook off
01:44:39.320 with a bowl of soup and insisting it's
01:44:41.000 chilly because you added some red food
01:44:43.119 coloring sure it's red but it ain't
01:44:45.239 chilly and your soup won't win any
01:44:47.040 awards for heat huh yeah it's okay we
01:44:50.199 need work not that good yeah it's very
01:44:53.159 very very it's dancing around it yeah it
01:44:57.040 is well needs some
01:44:59.639 work yeah needs a little work well humor
01:45:02.920 is a weird one right it's like I think
01:45:06.280 some humor especially like some of the
01:45:08.599 best humor is kind of spontaneous like
01:45:10.760 in the moment humor it's GNA it's going
01:45:12.599 to have a hard time deciding what people
01:45:14.520 are going to think is funny
01:45:16.760 yeah yeah but if you the the general R
01:45:19.840 over time though yeah the rule with
01:45:21.760 grock is supposed to be um that uh like
01:45:25.159 if you ask for something provided what
01:45:26.760 you're asking for is is legal it should
01:45:28.880 do it have you ever seen the video where
01:45:31.400 um they asked AI to uh create an
01:45:34.679 enlightened Bunny and they keep going
01:45:36.760 and make it more enlightened essentially
01:45:38.480 the bunny becomes God so the bunny
01:45:40.719 becomes a DMT trip yeah totally that's
01:45:43.520 that's that's that's funny that's kind
01:45:44.880 of what I was I was kind of hoping would
01:45:46.280 show would happen here yeah I have a
01:45:48.920 video of that I'll send it to Jamie CU
01:45:51.080 that that to me is pretty bizarre
01:45:52.679 because it's like more get more I I
01:45:55.320 might have got it to do it got it maybe
01:45:56.880 no I just not hold back oh you said
01:45:59.280 don't hold back critics out here acting
01:46:01.480 like it's the end of civilization as we
01:46:02.760 know it but it's not fair they cry as if
01:46:04.960 life ever was news flash it's like a
01:46:06.840 marathon where some no some people start
01:46:09.320 with roller blades on others well
01:46:11.360 they're just happy to have shoes well
01:46:12.800 now we're arguing over who gets to wear
01:46:14.520 the
01:46:15.679 skates okay some of it is not bad
01:46:18.000 imagine if we applied this logic
01:46:19.119 elsewhere identify as an airplane can I
01:46:20.679 fly with the birge in the sky
01:46:24.920 yeah lock room sure bu just don't
01:46:26.840 complain when gravity decides you're not
01:46:28.360 quite aerodynamic enough yeah so I mean
01:46:31.560 some it's okay um yeah the the argument
01:46:34.960 is kind of stupid though the thing thing
01:46:37.280 about the argument is they're not taking
01:46:39.159 into account perverts yeah right totally
01:46:42.280 yes exactly so I mean the thing is that
01:46:44.760 um if if you if you give if you provide
01:46:48.080 like a a moral get out of jail free card
01:46:51.639 like like if you say like if you adopt
01:46:53.800 this label you cannot be attacked in any
01:46:56.400 way shape or form right um you're you're
01:46:59.000 basically morally invulnerable then
01:47:01.560 obviously bad people will take advantage
01:47:03.520 of that yeah you're like literally
01:47:04.840 saying here's a here's a a a an
01:47:07.159 invulnerability card Moral Moral
01:47:08.880 invulnerability card um good people will
01:47:12.560 take it but also the bad people will
01:47:13.880 take it they're going the bad people are
01:47:15.679 going to be the fastest to take the the
01:47:17.679 the sort of the maral cloak yeah 100%
01:47:20.880 yeah and then there's a real
01:47:21.760 psychological condition called autog
01:47:23.520 gynophilus where people get aroused
01:47:25.920 heterosexual men get aroused by the idea
01:47:28.080 of dressing up like women and being
01:47:29.840 around women it's like a known
01:47:31.520 psychological condition that existed
01:47:33.199 forever and then you're allowing those
01:47:35.480 people to just say oh I'm trans and go
01:47:37.320 into the women's locker room and get
01:47:38.520 their their kicks and then there's real
01:47:40.119 trans people so there's like a lot of
01:47:42.199 variability like I I talked about it in
01:47:44.280 my act in my my Netflix special it's
01:47:46.280 like I believe in Freedom I believe in
01:47:48.599 transgender people but I also believe in
01:47:50.320 crazy people and if you can't if if you
01:47:52.880 trying to pretend that people aren't
01:47:54.280 crazy all the a sudden it's like it just
01:47:56.480 it just like like if if someone's a sort
01:47:59.320 of consenting adult and they want to
01:48:01.040 whatever they want to do to their body
01:48:02.280 as long as it's not harming someone else
01:48:03.719 I'm like that's fine yes you know like I
01:48:05.760 I believe in like individual Freedom um
01:48:08.800 and uh like like my you know my mom's
01:48:11.679 best friend like growing up when as was
01:48:13.040 a kid was a you know transgender woman
01:48:15.840 um in South Africa this was like where
01:48:18.800 you know she'd get beaten up a lot uh
01:48:21.119 because it was like back then you you
01:48:22.920 get beaten up um so um her name is Dion
01:48:28.239 and uh for a nice kind human being um
01:48:32.520 and um helped my mom a lot you know um
01:48:36.280 and uh and it's I think that's okay you
01:48:38.199 know that's that's fine if somebody
01:48:39.480 wants to make that choice as an adult
01:48:41.599 that's cool um there's a big difference
01:48:43.480 between that and an intact male who
01:48:46.760 wants to identify as a woman who wants
01:48:48.199 to walk around the locker room with his
01:48:49.560 dick out yes exactly because there's
01:48:50.960 people that do that just because they
01:48:52.280 get off
01:48:53.400 exactly so you just you just kind of
01:48:54.599 have something which is like a like I
01:48:56.400 said sort of moral invulnerability or
01:48:59.080 like where you can like even questioning
01:49:01.280 them is uh you get attacked you know
01:49:04.639 because obviously bad people will abuse
01:49:06.239 that well that's when I got thrown into
01:49:08.000 this whole thing because there was a
01:49:09.280 fighter who was a biological man who uh
01:49:12.760 became transgender and was competing
01:49:14.520 against women without telling them that
01:49:16.400 they were a biological man they said
01:49:17.880 they didn't have to tell people because
01:49:19.400 it was a medical condition like no yeah
01:49:22.840 that's not what it is it's not what it
01:49:24.880 is like you can't say that and and and
01:49:27.040 of all sports like if someone scores
01:49:30.239 more points in basketball well that's
01:49:32.639 unfair but if someone beats the [ __ ] out
01:49:35.119 of someone because they're lying about
01:49:36.719 being a biological male that's crazy
01:49:39.320 you're literally allowing someone to get
01:49:40.880 brain damage because you want to appeal
01:49:44.199 to the the woke [ __ ] crazy people
01:49:47.639 that think it's all right yeah it's so
01:49:50.000 strange that that when that's sort of
01:49:52.320 the thing that red pilled me when I got
01:49:54.239 attacked for that I'm like this is so
01:49:56.159 nuts I can't believe we're at this stage
01:49:58.920 where I'm saying hey I don't think it's
01:50:00.960 cool if you pretend you're a woman and
01:50:02.560 beat the [ __ ] out of women and people
01:50:03.719 are like you're out of line like totally
01:50:06.719 well we're in we're we're in fantasy
01:50:09.400 land now now we're pretending because it
01:50:12.119 it helps you it helps you feel better
01:50:14.239 yeah totally it's just such a strange
01:50:17.280 time and if it wasn't for something like
01:50:19.360 Twitter where this could be discussed
01:50:21.599 want some more that I'll get some more M
01:50:23.679 let's get some more coffee young Jamie
01:50:26.320 um if it wasn't for
01:50:28.239 Twitter you know at the early Twitter
01:50:31.840 you would be kicked off forever if you
01:50:35.040 just dead name someone so like which is
01:50:37.719 insane insane yeah insane I mean
01:50:41.040 especially if if you think about all the
01:50:42.880 things that like the look look the
01:50:45.760 Harris campaign and what the lies
01:50:48.320 they've told about Trump that we
01:50:49.480 discussed earlier uh you can't you don't
01:50:51.760 get kicked off for that but you get
01:50:53.440 kicked off for calling Caitlyn Jenner
01:50:54.920 Bruce Forever For Life yeah it's totally
01:50:58.480 insane yeah and but if it wasn't for you
01:51:01.520 buying that and and changing Twitter I I
01:51:05.560 don't think we would be where we're at
01:51:07.880 right now I think it was it was a
01:51:09.360 pivotal moment I think historically when
01:51:12.760 people look back on it it's going to be
01:51:14.199 a pivotal moment in this very bizarre
01:51:16.960 fight for the Freedom of
01:51:19.000 Information yeah well I mean at the time
01:51:22.239 I said I think like look I think this is
01:51:25.040 um existential to the United States um
01:51:27.840 it's existential to democracy um because
01:51:31.040 if if you don't if you don't have
01:51:32.400 freedom of
01:51:33.560 speech you don't have democracy okay
01:51:36.239 because if people if you don't have
01:51:37.400 freedom of speech people cannot make an
01:51:39.000 informed vote if if if they're just
01:51:41.239 being fed
01:51:42.239 propaganda uh and and there's no freedom
01:51:45.560 of speech democracy is an
01:51:48.599 illusion um so uh freedom of speech is
01:51:52.040 the bed Rock of democracy that's why
01:51:55.440 freedom of speech is the first amendment
01:51:58.159 once you lose freedom of speech you lose
01:52:01.000 democracy game over that's why I bought
01:52:04.599 Twitter and it seems so simple Yes it
01:52:08.560 seems so clear that everyone should
01:52:10.280 agree to that on the left or on the
01:52:11.960 right you shouldn't be given the
01:52:13.040 government if you imagine the Bush
01:52:14.719 Administration during the Iraq War
01:52:16.960 imagine if they had complete total
01:52:18.880 control of of propaganda and of dissent
01:52:21.760 online you don't want that no one wants
01:52:24.239 that no one from the left would want
01:52:25.520 that we shouldn't want it from the left
01:52:27.520 either absolutely and and and there's
01:52:29.520 also like the the media like the Legacy
01:52:32.480 the mainstream media what I call the
01:52:33.599 Legacy Media at this point um it it used
01:52:36.280 to be much more balanced like if you
01:52:37.599 look at sort of um political donations
01:52:39.440 over time Republican versus Democrat um
01:52:42.800 there used to be uh the media was I mean
01:52:45.320 they always had like a left bias but
01:52:46.840 there was like I don't know it was like
01:52:49.480 2/3 Democrat 1/3 Republican type of
01:52:51.679 thing in in ter in terms of uh
01:52:53.800 journalists giving making political
01:52:55.480 donations now it's like
01:52:57.560 95% or something a Democrat so the the
01:53:01.360 Legacy Media the mainstream media is is
01:53:04.520 is not balanced at all they're they're
01:53:06.480 just a mouthpiece for the Democrat
01:53:08.239 Democratic party um and you can see that
01:53:11.079 in in how consistent their headlines are
01:53:13.840 like they don't behave like their
01:53:15.119 different organizations they behave like
01:53:16.880 they're they're all one hive mind right
01:53:19.480 um so you know like a week before the
01:53:23.199 the Biden Trump debate um the there
01:53:26.719 every media organization was was saying
01:53:28.719 you know Biden is sh's attack I mean it
01:53:30.880 was like it's like it's like guys shop
01:53:32.560 attack is is not a common toner phrase
01:53:34.719 um and literally every TV station every
01:53:37.840 newspaper was like Shar sh like like
01:53:40.440 like somebody did a compilation of all
01:53:42.360 the uh you know the news anchors going
01:53:45.199 Biden Shar his attack Shar his ATT
01:53:46.560 attack is ATT attack it was absurd um
01:53:50.199 and there obviously a huge lie he is in
01:53:52.040 fact not Sha's attack as the public
01:53:54.360 learned one week later my favorite was
01:53:56.440 Joe
01:53:58.000 Scarboro yeah that yeah was wild yeah
01:54:02.520 listen to me this is the best version of
01:54:04.760 Biden ever the sharpest like what the
01:54:08.000 [ __ ] are you saying and then after the
01:54:10.040 debate he's like what do we got to we
01:54:11.480 got to get get rid of him like this is
01:54:13.199 crazy like what did you just say like a
01:54:15.679 couple weeks ago literally yes exactly
01:54:18.520 well the other thing was they're flat
01:54:19.800 out light when they decid that JD Vance
01:54:21.560 was weird yeah remember that one and
01:54:23.280 then they just weirds everywhere weird
01:54:24.960 weird every oh you don't want a weird
01:54:26.520 guy meanwhile you have [ __ ] Tim wal
01:54:28.599 is your VP you don't think that guy's
01:54:30.199 weird super weird he's weird in every
01:54:32.520 way the way he walks the way he waves
01:54:34.360 his hands yeah he reminds me of the
01:54:35.880 clown
01:54:37.719 Emoji he's a bizarre guy he's a strange
01:54:40.360 dude it's a it's I just don't understand
01:54:42.560 why they made that choice yeah it gives
01:54:44.000 the creep I just don't understand why
01:54:45.400 they made that choice there's a lot of
01:54:46.679 other people that are qualified I don't
01:54:48.520 know why in I read that KLA Harris made
01:54:51.239 that decision when she was sleep
01:54:52.400 deprived which is kind of hilarious that
01:54:54.560 she said that so she's kind of admitting
01:54:56.599 she kind of [ __ ] up yeah I mean they
01:54:58.639 obviously should have picked Josh
01:54:59.560 Shapiro at I mean governor of
01:55:01.239 Pennsylvania like that would have been
01:55:02.560 the nobra that's no-brainer move like
01:55:04.199 Pennsylvania's ly lynchpin state do you
01:55:06.400 think it's because he's Jewish because
01:55:08.360 of Shapiro that like the anti- Palestine
01:55:10.880 people would probably or the anti-
01:55:13.239 Palestinian uh Invasion people I think
01:55:15.599 it was an anti-semitic thing
01:55:17.800 yeah it could be that they thought that
01:55:20.040 that was a liability because there was
01:55:21.599 all these Pro Palestine people right now
01:55:23.960 because of the situation in Israel that
01:55:25.920 completely makes sense that they thought
01:55:27.320 that would be a liability but but I
01:55:28.880 don't know I don't know the reason I'm
01:55:29.840 just guessing but but but it's it seems
01:55:31.679 like a crazy thing to do given that
01:55:33.360 Pennsylvania's lynchman state you know
01:55:35.360 it's like the key to the election why
01:55:36.840 would you not pick the popular governor
01:55:38.280 of Pennsylvania right obviously
01:55:40.360 obviously yeah and other than that
01:55:42.400 there's a bunch of other ones too even
01:55:43.760 Nome there's a bunch of other people
01:55:45.199 that you could have chosen like Nome
01:55:46.880 would have been a fine example of
01:55:48.960 someone you could I mean I don't agree
01:55:50.400 with the guy exactly he's polished
01:55:53.440 politician like he lies about as much as
01:55:56.119 wals does but he doesn't lie about the
01:55:57.960 he doesn't say he was a [ __ ] head
01:55:59.360 coach when he was assistant coach
01:56:00.679 doesn't say he was in tennman square I
01:56:02.159 mean that's a liability all those
01:56:03.960 different things lying about his
01:56:05.199 military rank well and whilst like you
01:56:07.760 know Cut and Run when when you know when
01:56:09.480 he was actually called to duty well he
01:56:11.239 knew they were going to be deployed
01:56:12.639 months in advance so he resigned and he
01:56:14.320 also took uh so this is where he was
01:56:18.480 dishonest about his rank yeah CLA he was
01:56:21.119 like s or something like that because
01:56:23.760 that was like what he was going to get
01:56:25.960 if he
01:56:26.960 stay but then he resigned because he
01:56:30.360 knew that he was going to get deployed
01:56:31.639 allegedly I mean that seems like like a
01:56:33.840 cowardly action well whatever it is it's
01:56:36.079 dishonest I mean just to say look just
01:56:38.760 saying that you were a head coach when
01:56:40.960 you're an assistant coach is [ __ ]
01:56:42.520 crazy that's a lie don't do that you
01:56:44.639 should never do that yeah saying he was
01:56:47.000 in tin square or whatever or in Hong
01:56:49.079 Kong whatever like like yo that's one of
01:56:51.119 the most biggest moments in history like
01:56:53.480 it's not like you forgot what you had
01:56:55.079 for lunch last week you know right and
01:56:56.719 not only that but you don't think people
01:56:58.239 are going to research that yeah totally
01:57:00.840 I mean and the the response during the
01:57:02.840 debate was bananas said I'm a
01:57:05.400 knucklehead Yeah well yeah we don't want
01:57:07.560 a knucklehead for a VP okay yeah this is
01:57:10.040 like sometimes I'm a knucklehead like
01:57:11.639 what are you saying are you saying you
01:57:13.800 lied like what did you I I mean this is
01:57:15.960 where you need a podcast and not a
01:57:17.960 debate exactly where you go okay when
01:57:21.199 did you first that you were in t square
01:57:23.960 like did someone say it and you didn't
01:57:26.239 refute it and you got stuck with it like
01:57:28.360 what was cuz this is the thing about
01:57:30.159 like carrying weapons of war like what I
01:57:32.520 carried when I like and like you didn't
01:57:34.239 deploy in war yeah like you can't say
01:57:36.760 that but you kind of let people say that
01:57:39.199 you deployed and then you kind of didn't
01:57:42.480 you know you were deployed in war so did
01:57:45.760 you lie or did someone else lie and you
01:57:47.840 didn't correct them like this is the
01:57:49.719 kind of conversation that you would want
01:57:50.960 to have with a guy
01:57:52.639 podcast and the debates were so [ __ ]
01:57:55.560 skewed where they were correcting like
01:57:58.159 particularly the Biden one where they're
01:57:59.560 correcting Trump over and over again and
01:58:01.320 then correcting Trump with uh comma
01:58:04.199 where kamla was saying things were not
01:58:06.639 true I mean KLA repeated deliberately
01:58:09.360 repeated the fine people hoax and was
01:58:10.920 not fact checked well not only that she
01:58:12.880 also said that no troops were being
01:58:15.320 deployed in a war zone which is I mean I
01:58:18.679 I know troops in war zones I'm like um
01:58:22.639 that's and as vice president you're
01:58:24.480 privy you know you're like you you know
01:58:26.960 you know the official troops and The
01:58:28.719 Unofficial troops right you know so what
01:58:32.119 she said was a like flat out boldface
01:58:34.320 lie flat Next Level boldface lie have
01:58:37.159 you seen the video absurd lie of the
01:58:39.159 troops that were watching it take place
01:58:41.079 and what the [ __ ] are we they're
01:58:42.400 watching it in real time video we're
01:58:45.320 here being shot at so crazy crazy but it
01:58:49.400 just shows you the level of propaganda
01:58:51.719 that we're being subject to which is why
01:58:53.679 people think Donald Trump is the devil
01:58:55.760 cuz the machine has gone all out as far
01:58:59.000 as it can go with laware with propaganda
01:59:02.360 with lies with just pushing as much in
01:59:06.520 this direction as humanly possible
01:59:09.320 connecting it to the Nazi rally like
01:59:11.440 every step of the way no wonder why
01:59:13.920 boomers are like rabid like you got to
01:59:16.199 keep this Nazi out of office he's a
01:59:18.239 fascist exactly if if all you if all you
01:59:20.719 get is like if if you're entire exposure
01:59:22.719 is to Legacy mainstream media um so that
01:59:26.280 all your information sources are that
01:59:27.920 Trump is basically Hitler um then and
01:59:31.560 you have no and your friend group is has
01:59:34.679 that same information you have no
01:59:35.880 counterveiling opinion right so then
01:59:38.280 then they they actually just think like
01:59:39.880 Trump is is Hitler even though it's it's
01:59:42.400 like a little strange he didn't do
01:59:43.560 Hitler things the last four years yeah
01:59:45.639 you know I'm like if he's Hitler why
01:59:47.520 didn't he do Hitler things when he was
01:59:49.199 president for four years right like the
01:59:50.960 reason you know we we we hate hitas
01:59:53.280 because of he started wars in the
01:59:55.239 genocide not because he was a snappy
01:59:57.079 dresser you know um you know and and I'm
01:59:59.719 like uh so tell me about the wars and
02:00:02.040 genocide that Trump did uh I don't
02:00:04.440 remember that and he was President for
02:00:06.320 four years
02:00:08.280 so it's insane it makes no sense well
02:00:11.199 and also he's campaigning on stopping
02:00:13.199 all the wars it's like his primary
02:00:15.079 concern exactly the warmongers like Liz
02:00:17.400 Cheney hate him yeah cuz they love war
02:00:20.280 well they profit off of it they profit
02:00:21.599 off of War yeah yes which is insane
02:00:24.079 insane yeah and that this is happening
02:00:26.639 right in front of everybody's face yeah
02:00:28.199 the the war propers hate Trump yeah
02:00:30.960 which is [ __ ] up I mean mean it's like
02:00:32.599 like like we should be like yeah we
02:00:34.079 let's vote for the guy that the world
02:00:35.159 propers hate that sounds like a great
02:00:36.800 idea it was the wildest thing when Dick
02:00:39.760 Cheney endorsed KLA and the left went
02:00:41.840 crazy like Yay Dick Cheney's on our side
02:00:44.400 like yeah like I'm like can we can we
02:00:47.079 play all the all the videos where you
02:00:48.199 said Dick Cheney was the devil it's the
02:00:50.560 craziest turn the craziest like 180 I've
02:00:53.960 ever seen in my life cuz there's no
02:00:55.400 reason for it yeah doesn't make any
02:00:57.239 sense make sense no logic to it at all
02:00:59.560 just all the sudden he's the devil yeah
02:01:01.440 or he's not The Devil he's he's good
02:01:03.599 it's good that he's supporting Kama even
02:01:05.000 Dick Cheney you
02:01:07.360 know I mean warmongers want want the the
02:01:10.639 kamla puppet regime because they will
02:01:13.199 get more war it's so strange watching
02:01:15.320 all these Hollywood celebrities like
02:01:17.079 step up like and they think it's going
02:01:19.000 to get them more movies or something
02:01:20.639 that's what it is if you know those
02:01:21.760 people people so many of them are compl
02:01:24.159 narcissists well let me tell you how it
02:01:26.000 actually works there is what happens is
02:01:28.280 you know these celebrities they they get
02:01:29.679 a call okay they had a call from someone
02:01:31.520 powerful in Hollywood and uh that person
02:01:34.400 says uh you know it would be really
02:01:35.960 great if you endorsed uh kamla you don't
02:01:38.400 have to it's up to you but if you don't
02:01:41.960 they don't say it they don't say it but
02:01:43.159 if you don't you're never going to get a
02:01:44.400 call again no more movies no more
02:01:48.320 concerts but they they ask they'll ask
02:01:50.400 it they asking really nice way it'd be
02:01:53.159 really nice if you endorse K this is
02:01:54.719 important and so they don't say that if
02:01:57.159 you don't they don't make the threat
02:01:58.440 they don't need
02:01:59.840 to but everyone knows what'll happen if
02:02:02.360 you don't well I think there's also even
02:02:04.560 if they don't think that something's
02:02:05.960 going to happen to them if they don't
02:02:08.119 there's this compelling feeling to
02:02:11.280 support this cause that you think is
02:02:14.000 going to get you a bunch of positive
02:02:15.960 attention and you're going to be on the
02:02:18.679 right side of history and all these
02:02:20.520 narratives that you especially from the
02:02:22.119 left in Hollywood like they're all in on
02:02:25.199 whoever the [ __ ] is the Democrat always
02:02:27.360 100% there's never a call from the the
02:02:30.639 the Hollywood Machine to support any
02:02:33.280 Republicans I've never seen it once yeah
02:02:35.119 ever never so it's like you realize that
02:02:38.199 and that whole business is based on
02:02:41.040 getting picked it's the whole business
02:02:43.599 is not necessarily Merit based there's a
02:02:45.199 lot of brilliant actors you never hear
02:02:46.800 from there's a lot of people who can do
02:02:48.159 that but they don't get chosen for roles
02:02:50.880 and everybody knows this that you have
02:02:52.360 to sort of socialize the line or you
02:02:54.119 don't get chosen for the roles cuz
02:02:55.599 there's a lot of competition for the
02:02:56.639 rols this why that's why I say like when
02:03:00.239 you when someone powerful in Hollywood
02:03:01.840 who's able to make to choose these roles
02:03:03.560 calls one of these celebrities they know
02:03:05.320 the deal yeah there's no no no threat is
02:03:08.599 necessary well you could see it in real
02:03:10.560 time like with Dennis Quaid when he made
02:03:12.119 that Reagan movie and they wouldn't let
02:03:13.440 him advertise on social media platforms
02:03:15.960 they were they were Banning ads for it
02:03:18.679 yeah for what because it was an election
02:03:20.639 year like what are you talking about
02:03:21.480 this about a guy who's dead yes guy who
02:03:24.440 was president a long ass time ago like
02:03:26.480 what what do you how is this how does
02:03:28.280 this have anything to do with the
02:03:29.079 election year y but it's the punishment
02:03:32.079 it's like you stepped outside the line
02:03:33.679 you supported the other guy yeah you the
02:03:35.719 problem is you'll just you'll just never
02:03:36.800 you'll just never get a call G for a
02:03:38.119 movie or you know concert or whatever it
02:03:40.040 is yeah which is crazy that's the issue
02:03:42.920 I mean we used to allow people to be a
02:03:46.520 Republican and still be a movie star
02:03:49.320 like Clint Eastwood Reagan yeah but
02:03:51.360 Clint
02:03:52.360 yeah like during the Obama
02:03:53.400 Administration Clint Eastwood was like
02:03:55.840 an outspoken Republican and yet was you
02:03:59.400 know a giant movie star and people's
02:04:01.760 like ah it's Clint he was allowed you
02:04:03.920 were allowed to have there was a variety
02:04:06.320 of different opin charlon hon there was
02:04:08.199 a variety of different opinions you were
02:04:09.880 allowed to have but now you're not now
02:04:12.920 it's just like and once Trump trump got
02:04:15.480 into office he became this focal point
02:04:19.599 where the all logic was thrown out the
02:04:21.920 window and it's just Trump is bad you
02:04:24.040 have to attack Trump trump is right
02:04:25.800 right wi's bad everyone rightwing is bad
02:04:27.880 Christian's bad yes it's just strange
02:04:31.599 yeah
02:04:33.639 exactly so well I'll say it again man um
02:04:38.040 I think this is the last election if if
02:04:39.639 Trump doesn't win this is the last
02:04:41.960 election I think you're right yeah I
02:04:44.320 think you're right I think people and a
02:04:46.719 lot of people are waking up and realize
02:04:48.679 that that have been lifelong Democrats
02:04:50.480 guys like Bill Amman like chth Tulsi
02:04:53.599 Garett switched over to the Republicans
02:04:55.199 like there's a lot of people who their
02:04:56.880 whole life they've been leftwing and
02:04:58.199 they realize like I can't do this
02:05:00.000 anymore you and I used to be Democrats
02:05:01.520 yeah so yeah yeah it's nuts it's nuts
02:05:05.400 man and uh you know I mean I think the
02:05:08.480 things we want are just pretty basic you
02:05:10.239 know it's like we want you individual
02:05:12.320 liberties and we want um opportunity W
02:05:15.679 America Remain the land of freedom and
02:05:17.960 opportunity um so we maximize people's
02:05:20.440 personal freedom the govern can't BGE
02:05:22.360 into your house and kill your [ __ ]
02:05:23.520 pet um that's that's [ __ ] up um and uh
02:05:28.840 you know and and and that you succeed as
02:05:30.719 a function of your of your of hard work
02:05:32.679 and talent not anything else not race
02:05:35.320 religion sex doesn't matter you know yes
02:05:37.880 it's basic stuff and and then what did
02:05:39.760 you change the the acronym Dei what did
02:05:42.000 you change it to oh
02:05:43.480 diie what is it

02:05:50.559 and Equity is Di
02:05:52.440 but didn't you change dedication
02:05:55.320 excellence and yeah yeah yeah yeah I
02:05:59.000 mean we we want America opport America
02:06:01.880 being the land of opportunity means that
02:06:03.639 that that we we have an environment
02:06:05.119 where you succeed as a function of your
02:06:06.360 hard workor and skill yeah you know and
02:06:08.079 and that's
02:06:10.199 radical yeah radical the best person
02:06:13.760 makes you rightwing now you know I'm
02:06:15.440 like okay great Co me ring I don't care
02:06:17.719 um so you know like and and and you we
02:06:20.920 we you're not real country unless you
02:06:22.320 have secure borders you're just a fake
02:06:24.079 country um so we we need and our cities
02:06:27.320 are unsafe and and dirty um like um you
02:06:31.559 know my my mom was telling me my mom's
02:06:33.639 like pretty red pulled at this point but
02:06:35.639 but you know what's going to Red Pill
02:06:36.599 you really really fast is is is having a
02:06:39.119 friends get assaulted on the streets of
02:06:40.480 New York yeah and and that happened to
02:06:43.119 three of our friends this year got
02:06:45.119 assaulted on the streets of New York
02:06:46.400 just walking around yeah um and um
02:06:50.320 nobody got arrested
02:06:52.639 nothing nothing happened well the the
02:06:55.800 morale of police is like
02:06:58.280 depleted yeah substantially for sure the
02:07:01.360 morale of the police get depleted and
02:07:03.239 and then also like at some point like
02:07:05.159 like if you're a police officer and you
02:07:06.719 you're arresting someone who's who's
02:07:08.320 violent you're putting a life at risk
02:07:09.880 obviously because they might you know
02:07:11.480 some sometimes they'll try to kill you
02:07:13.440 and then if you know that arresting
02:07:15.079 that's violent person they will be
02:07:16.599 immediately released by The Da which
02:07:18.159 happens in New York Alvin brag doesn't
02:07:20.040 he doesn't prosecute people um then then
02:07:23.159 why why should a police officer put
02:07:24.440 their life at risk to arrest someone
02:07:26.000 when they know they will not be they
02:07:28.440 will just be let out immediately yeah
02:07:30.280 it's pointless yeah then we got it's
02:07:32.679 like the freaking Joker it's like dark
02:07:35.000 KN Dark Knight like the freaking Joker
02:07:37.320 is in charge yeah like the the criminals
02:07:40.639 Run free and the citizens are
02:07:43.960 arrested that
02:07:45.800 like this is why I like keep com back to
02:07:48.159 this this I'm like still pretty shook
02:07:50.400 about the freaking squirrel thing it's
02:07:51.320 like yeah they at at gunpoint forced the
02:07:54.840 guy to like stay outside his house while
02:07:57.000 they got his pets and killed them
02:07:59.880 meanwhile you know violent felons are
02:08:01.960 running free in this is in New York
02:08:03.559 states are running free this this a
02:08:06.239 joker yeah it's not the the LW abiding
02:08:08.599 citizens are are you know arrested and
02:08:12.239 and and the criminals are they free this
02:08:15.000 is this is [ __ ] up guys just the fact
02:08:16.679 that they have the resources to do that
02:08:18.599 when they have all the crime that they
02:08:20.000 have you have the resource
02:08:22.239 the government resources to go kill
02:08:23.639 someone's squirrel yeah what this whole
02:08:26.440 idea of this um government efficiency
02:08:29.960 agency the Govern yeah I mean qu
02:08:32.040 whatever you want but what do you want
02:08:33.079 to call it what do you call it I mean I
02:08:34.280 think the funniest name is is do the the
02:08:37.040 Doge Department of Department of
02:08:40.360 government efficiency um yeah I mean the
02:08:43.639 idea is is pretty simple is that like
02:08:46.480 we've got uh this this uh suffocating
02:08:50.480 massive Federal
02:08:52.000 bureaucracy and we need to uh you it's
02:08:55.520 that is and the government government
02:08:57.760 spending is like bankrupting the country
02:08:59.960 uh you know our uh interest payments on
02:09:03.239 the national debt now exceed the defense
02:09:05.719 department budget which is and the
02:09:08.800 defense budget is like a trillion
02:09:10.079 dollars a year interest payments on our
02:09:12.480 on the national debt are now higher than
02:09:15.639 the defense department budget and and
02:09:18.119 growing like every month so it's like
02:09:20.559 it's not like a like basically we're on
02:09:22.480 a path to to bankruptcy America's on a
02:09:24.520 path to bankruptcy so we have to cut
02:09:26.239 government spending um or we're just
02:09:28.239 going to go bankrupt just like Postwood
02:09:29.960 that overspends um and then but it's
02:09:32.840 even worse than that like we're spending
02:09:34.119 money on all these like these government
02:09:35.880 agencies and I like I asked I actually
02:09:38.440 asked the AI like how many government
02:09:39.679 agencies are there and
02:09:42.320 uh the government isn't even sure how
02:09:44.400 many government agencies there are like
02:09:46.159 so so it's like somewhere around 450
02:09:48.280 depending on what you call an agency so
02:09:50.400 there there are so there there at the
02:09:52.599 federal level so that that that's almost
02:09:54.960 twice as many a agencies as as years
02:09:57.440 that America has existed so we're
02:09:59.159 creating agencies at roughly two
02:10:01.159 agencies a
02:10:02.320 year wow yes uh so this is insane I bet
02:10:07.360 there's like I I I wonder if there's
02:10:09.239 even one person who could even name all
02:10:10.840 450 agencies at the federal level I
02:10:14.639 there might be no one um but hardly
02:10:17.119 anyone let's just say I bet I bet most
02:10:18.760 people couldn't even name like a 100 you
02:10:20.840 know so
02:10:21.840 so this is this is this is crazy so we
02:10:24.559 got the
02:10:25.440 suffocating this vast suffocating
02:10:28.079 Federal bureaucracy that just gets
02:10:30.199 bigger every year um and and eventually
02:10:33.280 you get to the point where everything's
02:10:34.159 illegal you can't get anything done so
02:10:37.159 so what can be done like with obviously
02:10:41.639 the president has a lot of power but how
02:10:44.159 much power and what can be done in terms
02:10:46.639 of like eliminating agencies eliminating
02:10:48.920 waste eliminating yeah well I
02:10:52.040 so like if if Congress has created an
02:10:54.840 agency then I often if you look at the
02:10:56.800 law the law is like pretty simple like
02:10:58.599 the agency has like a very simple task
02:11:01.280 but then that agency over time vastly
02:11:05.040 increases its Authority um and starts
02:11:07.920 doing things that were never authorized
02:11:09.320 by Congress um that's happened with
02:11:11.239 pretty much every agency so so yeah
02:11:14.159 you'd have to you'd have to still you
02:11:16.520 know uh keep an agency you'd have to
02:11:19.199 match the law but you can you can tail
02:11:21.639 the agencies to be much smaller and say
02:11:23.679 you got to stick to what Congress
02:11:24.840 authorized instead of all this other
02:11:26.679 stuff you're
02:11:27.679 doing which I think makes sense and so
02:11:29.880 is the other stuff they're doing just
02:11:31.239 essentially bu bureaucracy run a muck or
02:11:33.920 they just create jobs and create things
02:11:36.199 to do and create a meaning for their
02:11:38.599 existence yeah it's like a tumor it's
02:11:41.440 just going to keep growing Jesus Christ
02:11:44.520 and it and it's so I mean for SpaceX
02:11:48.320 Starship was sitting on on the pad the
02:11:49.840 rocket with the giant rocket we could
02:11:51.920 build the rocket faster than they could
02:11:53.480 process the paperwork to approve the
02:11:54.800 launch two so we're sitting there for
02:11:56.800 two
02:11:58.880 months but do you think that they're
02:12:00.639 doing that on purpose to [ __ ] with you I
02:12:03.159 can't I
02:12:04.199 mean maybe a little but I mean that was
02:12:07.360 also not be
02:12:08.480 cool yeah uh but the I mean another way
02:12:12.920 to think of it is like the the amount of
02:12:15.840 the amount of paperwork uh is going to
02:12:18.159 go roughly with the square of the number
02:12:20.000 of agencies involved so because they all
02:12:22.159 have to meet with each other so like
02:12:23.800 let's say in a best case situation if if
02:12:26.480 if you've got like if if there's like if
02:12:29.599 you're dealing with one agency that's
02:12:30.880 one thing but if if you've got to deal
02:12:32.040 with five agencies and the agencies will
02:12:33.840 have to meet with each other now You'
02:12:35.719 got like you
02:12:37.480 know 25 different you know meeting
02:12:42.440 configurations that have to take place
02:12:46.280 uh and it just everything just you you
02:12:50.520 get just hardened of the arteries you
02:12:51.920 just can't make make progress like this
02:12:53.840 is why we can't build build High
02:12:55.079 highspeed rail in America it's basically
02:12:57.280 illegal right so this has been the the
02:12:59.440 argument has always been that we need
02:13:00.960 regulation because we need to protect
02:13:02.880 the environment we need to protect
02:13:04.599 people we need to make sure the rule of
02:13:06.719 laws followed so we need a certain
02:13:08.360 amount of Regulation but overregulation
02:13:10.679 is a giant problem that's a big issue in
02:13:13.320 California it's a huge issue anywhere
02:13:16.079 where bureaucracy has run a run a monck
02:13:18.920 they make it very difficult to get
02:13:20.280 anything done yes I mean what happens is
02:13:23.840 every year there are more rules and
02:13:26.280 regulations created um and in the past
02:13:30.199 what has served as a cleansing function
02:13:32.400 for rules and regulations is war because
02:13:34.760 like like well we're going to lose if we
02:13:36.320 don't kind of clear the decks but we
02:13:38.440 haven't really had an existential threat
02:13:41.000 of of war in the US we've had prosperity
02:13:42.960 for a long time which has resulted in a
02:13:45.440 massive buildup of rules and regulations
02:13:47.320 every year um and to the point where
02:13:50.559 like I said like everything's illegal
02:13:52.239 you know and it's not like any one
02:13:53.400 regulation is the problem it's like it's
02:13:55.400 like glia being tied down by a million
02:13:57.400 little strings it's not like any one
02:13:59.280 string is the problem but you got a
02:14:00.400 million of them so we have we we've got
02:14:03.719 to clear the decks here um and and I'm
02:14:07.400 not saying we shouldn't have Regulators
02:14:08.719 I'm just saying we we we've gone way too
02:14:12.000 far once you think of regulators like uh
02:14:14.639 like referees on a field you know a
02:14:16.639 sports field um you don't want to have
02:14:19.320 no no refs you want to have some number
02:14:21.400 of refs but you you don't want to have
02:14:22.840 way more refs than players right you
02:14:24.960 don't want to be like well you know the
02:14:27.840 running back couldn't couldn't complete
02:14:29.920 the F because there were too many
02:14:31.400 Regulators in the way because the
02:14:33.159 football Field's full of regulators yeah
02:14:35.079 you know like you can't even play the
02:14:36.280 game right that's the issue we got right
02:14:37.960 now well that's a great analogy yeah I
02:14:39.840 can imagine a football field that's
02:14:41.880 filled with refere like the football
02:14:43.639 Field's filled with refs you know you
02:14:45.119 can't even run past them yeah yeah that
02:14:47.880 I've seen criticism of this idea of you
02:14:51.480 um coming up with this department of
02:14:54.440 like firing a bunch of people and what
02:14:56.440 would happen and how would that work but
02:14:57.719 the criticism doesn't make any sense to
02:14:59.239 me because if there is if you measurably
02:15:04.599 if you can prove that there's a lot of
02:15:06.639 wasted time and resources which I think
02:15:09.440 is pretty easy to do and if you could
02:15:12.000 say that this is not the most efficient
02:15:13.960 like the most efficient businesses are
02:15:15.520 generally private businesses or a a
02:15:18.280 company because they kind of have to be
02:15:20.520 in order stay profitable yeah the
02:15:22.480 government doesn't have to be profitable
02:15:24.880 they don't have to be efficient they
02:15:26.360 don't have competition y so if you're
02:15:28.280 making cars and your cars break down
02:15:29.920 they suck and someone makes cars and the
02:15:31.480 cars are better they're going to succeed
02:15:33.599 so this is the free market the
02:15:35.079 government doesn't have this problem
02:15:36.719 when they're they're in charge of
02:15:38.320 certain things that could probably be
02:15:40.719 better served by the public by the
02:15:42.559 private
02:15:43.599 sector yeah absolutely well look I just
02:15:46.239 think we' we've gotten we've got far too
02:15:47.920 many government agencies the the federal
02:15:49.719 bureaucracy has gotten out of hand
02:15:51.559 um and we just need to pair it down to a
02:15:52.840 sensible level um and if it turns out
02:15:55.520 that like there's some regulation or
02:15:57.920 agency that was doing something useful
02:15:59.840 we can put it right back no problem like
02:16:02.079 it's like oh that regulation was
02:16:03.239 important no problem we put it right
02:16:04.440 back right as long as actually know but
02:16:07.480 be able to be able to look at it
02:16:08.760 logically and objectively and you were
02:16:11.239 also floating around the idea of
02:16:13.079 offering a large Severance to the people
02:16:15.239 that you're going to have removed yeah
02:16:17.599 like a couple years or something like
02:16:18.840 that is that what you're saying yeah I
02:16:20.480 mean I'm just these are again just ideas
02:16:22.880 but I mean it's the point is not that
02:16:24.960 people suffer economic hardship the
02:16:27.000 point is just that they they're it's
02:16:28.880 better there are more productive things
02:16:30.599 they can do in the economy and it's and
02:16:32.920 it would be better if they did these
02:16:34.318 other more productive things um and we
02:16:37.318 didn't have this vast pedal bureaucracy
02:16:39.760 so so like so I was like H you know
02:16:41.280 maybe like a couple years of pay would
02:16:42.760 be good um and then they they could take
02:16:45.240 a vacation they could take it take
02:16:47.000 another job and get double pay I mean
02:16:48.920 it's like it's not like a
02:16:51.398 it's not going to sense create create an
02:16:52.679 economic crisis I think it's actually
02:16:54.439 going to be really good I think because
02:16:56.679 uh we can PE you know people can move to
02:16:59.160 where they're making products and
02:17:00.318 services that are more useful to their
02:17:02.318 fellow human beings the problem is if
02:17:04.398 someone has like a 25 30e career of
02:17:07.080 being
02:17:07.959 institutionalized you're essentially
02:17:09.920 like a part of the government system
02:17:12.200 you've sort of programmed your life and
02:17:14.439 your career to be a part of this
02:17:16.478 bureaucratic system and then you're like
02:17:18.959 NOP you have to go out and compete in
02:17:20.280 the free market you're like
02:17:23.519 Ah that's that's scary to people but you
02:17:26.200 have to be valuable you have to actually
02:17:28.318 be valuable yeah yeah uh I mean let's
02:17:32.040 look at like you know whatever the the
02:17:33.160 Govern pension and stuff they're not
02:17:34.240 going to be you know um in tough I think
02:17:37.718 they'll be in good Financial shape how
02:17:39.799 are you going to have the time to
02:17:40.840 oversee all this
02:17:43.120 [ __ ] well I'm I'm I'm pretty good at uh
02:17:46.920 you improving efficiency I mean um I
02:17:49.599 would say so yeah
02:17:51.638 but still this this seems like a giant
02:17:55.359 undertaking yeah I I'll probably need to
02:17:57.558 beef obscurity um oh yeah yeah yeah for
02:18:01.599 sure um but you know like I said like no
02:18:04.040 one's going to experience like I think
02:18:05.478 economic hardship that's you know they
02:18:08.439 they'll be fine you know and they'll
02:18:10.398 they'll people do find other roles I
02:18:12.638 mean you can look at sort of um you know
02:18:15.080 like when East Germany and and West
02:18:16.799 Germany got back together you know
02:18:18.718 everyone was basically working for the
02:18:19.799 government in East Germany
02:18:21.318 and um and it was really inefficient and
02:18:24.120 that like their economic output was like
02:18:27.160 in East Germany was like I know a
02:18:28.920 quarter of what it was in in West
02:18:30.519 Germany because everyone was working for
02:18:32.120 the government government's like
02:18:33.398 fundamentally inefficient so um the best
02:18:36.318 example is probably North and South
02:18:37.599 Korea right yeah like people are
02:18:39.080 starving North Korea and and South Korea
02:18:40.920 is incredibly prosperous yeah so and
02:18:43.439 it's the same people just different
02:18:45.040 operating system right so um you know
02:18:49.280 it's just like you just want to move
02:18:50.840 people from you know less productive
02:18:53.840 things to more productive things um
02:18:56.040 where they may you because you can also
02:18:57.638 say like in the limit like let's just
02:18:59.280 say let's consider the other direction
02:19:01.799 where we moved a whole bunch of people
02:19:03.519 that were in the private sector doing
02:19:05.240 making goods and services and we moved
02:19:06.799 them into the government as Regulators
02:19:09.120 now they stopped making those goods and
02:19:10.439 services the so the stuff they were
02:19:12.318 making is no longer available now
02:19:13.840 they're just being
02:19:17.160 Regulators like is that a good thing
02:19:19.040 that's not a good thing doesn't sound
02:19:20.478 good no it's not good doesn't sound like
02:19:22.398 there's a real market for it like you're
02:19:23.879 creating jobs that don't necessarily
02:19:25.638 need to be there they're all these fake
02:19:27.200 jobs basically um and um that doesn't
02:19:30.799 make sense so look we we got to do this
02:19:33.599 because the the country's going bankrupt
02:19:35.638 like we if we don't take action we're
02:19:37.879 we're dollars going to be worth nothing
02:19:40.558 and the interest payments which are
02:19:42.760 already 23% of of to of 23% of all
02:19:46.398 govern income call income taxes tariffs
02:19:48.800 and everything is just going to pay
02:19:50.359 interest
02:19:51.200 right now and that number is continually
02:19:53.120 Rising so if we don't do something the
02:19:55.720 entire government budget will be paying
02:19:57.280 interest there won't be money for
02:19:59.040 anything no it won't be money for Social
02:20:00.600 Security won't be money for Medicare
02:20:02.800 nothing that's where we're headed that's
02:20:05.000 what bankruptcy means yeah that's such
02:20:07.600 an insane concept
02:20:09.439 yes um let like hello wake
02:20:13.479 up wake up and if somebody can tell me
02:20:16.560 can can can show me like pencil out the
02:20:18.080 math show me how this works I'd love to
02:20:19.439 hear it but but just like listen I'm
02:20:21.560 looking at the numbers here and I'm like
02:20:23.120 if we're don't to do something America's
02:20:25.640 toast won't be money for anything Trump
02:20:27.760 likes to talk a lot about a lot is
02:20:29.399 tariffs yeah what what are your thoughts
02:20:31.399 on tariffs I know that's very
02:20:32.520 controversial to even people economists
02:20:36.479 they disagree some agree some think it's
02:20:38.439 a good idea some think it's a terrible
02:20:39.880 idea what do you
02:20:41.080 think I think you need to be careful
02:20:43.000 with tariffs
02:20:44.680 um like the I I deal a lot a lot with
02:20:48.800 like supply chain issues you know like
02:20:51.160 like the global automotive supply chain
02:20:53.240 for Tesla for example is incredibly
02:20:54.920 complex so when there are sudden changes
02:20:56.960 in tariffs then you're like well you
02:20:59.640 we've got a factory like somewhere else
02:21:01.800 that's making a part that goes into the
02:21:03.240 car now that suddenly if that part's
02:21:05.200 suddenly twice as expensive it like
02:21:07.160 messes everything up you know so um so
02:21:10.560 you you want to be uh have tariffs be
02:21:14.439 predictable um so that companies can
02:21:16.399 adjust their supply chain I mean I think
02:21:17.880 I think companies are more than happy to
02:21:19.840 uh increase uh Manufacturing in America
02:21:22.560 it's just that you can't do it instantly
02:21:24.800 so if if you if you put in if you if you
02:21:28.160 put put up giant tariffs immediately um
02:21:31.319 and don't give companies a chance to uh
02:21:34.560 you know build factories in America like
02:21:36.840 because you have to you got to move
02:21:37.680 atoms like you've got to build a
02:21:39.479 building you've got to install equipment
02:21:41.479 you've got to train people like that
02:21:44.560 doesn't happen instantly um so you just
02:21:48.160 got you want to have a for tariffs uh
02:21:51.880 you want to have a ramp so that people
02:21:53.760 companies can adjust um and and and
02:21:56.160 build the factories and train the people
02:21:57.960 and get the equipment in place um
02:22:00.520 otherwise just you basically just shock
02:22:02.120 the system and it and and it breaks or
02:22:04.479 bad things happen so I'm I'm against
02:22:06.560 like sudden sudden giant tariffs because
02:22:09.200 they they're it's an impossible response
02:22:11.640 if you've got to you know move a
02:22:14.359 thousand tons of equipment you know you
02:22:16.439 just some cases collectively millions of
02:22:19.479 tons of equipment you just can't do that
02:22:21.319 overnight it's literally impossible so I
02:22:24.479 think we want to be thoughtful about
02:22:27.200 tariffs um and and give companies a ramp
02:22:31.840 I mean I do generally agree that America
02:22:34.080 should do more manufacturing I'm a big
02:22:36.040 manufacturing guy I love manufacturing
02:22:38.080 so I've spent a lot of time in the
02:22:39.439 factory well we've talked openly about
02:22:41.319 the difficulties of manufacturing and
02:22:43.200 how complicated it is and about most
02:22:44.760 people aren't really aware of something
02:22:46.560 that's as complex as like say building a
02:22:48.600 Tesla yeah Manu is super hard and
02:22:52.040 complicated
02:22:53.800 so you know like a lot of people just
02:22:56.600 they they've never been in a factory or
02:22:57.920 they don't know where how how difficult
02:22:59.840 it is to make things um and they you
02:23:02.240 know for a lot of people they think just
02:23:03.280 ketchup comes from the store you know
02:23:04.680 like the store like just has a like
02:23:07.160 those are like people like for a lot of
02:23:09.000 people who've been in Academia or you
02:23:10.920 know for all these like sort of
02:23:11.720 Socialist Communist types like they've
02:23:13.280 never actually made anything so they
02:23:15.479 they they they're opera on the premise
02:23:16.920 that there's this magical Horn of planty
02:23:19.200 that just outputs goods and services and
02:23:21.520 if someone's got more goods and services
02:23:23.160 than someone else's cuz they took more
02:23:24.560 from this magical Horn of Plenty and I'm
02:23:26.439 like guys there's no magical Horn of
02:23:27.720 Plenty the the there's there's no
02:23:31.120 Cornucopia uh it's actually goods and
02:23:33.359 services come from people working
02:23:35.319 collectively doing a lot of hard work to
02:23:37.160 produce the goods and services that you
02:23:38.880 like um and that you that you need um so
02:23:43.279 but we've become very accustomed these
02:23:45.000 things happening overseas I mean America
02:23:47.600 is still the second biggest manufacturer
02:23:48.960 in the world so it's not not mean still
02:23:50.920 make a lot of stuff but um we could make
02:23:53.479 more um probably should make more I
02:23:56.160 think we should value manufacturing a
02:23:57.359 lot more in the United States than we
02:23:58.600 currently do well it' be very nice if we
02:24:00.439 were completely self-sufficient like
02:24:02.760 medicine like there's a bunch of
02:24:04.080 different things that get manufactured
02:24:05.520 overseas that was a huge problem during
02:24:07.600 covid because all the shipping was shut
02:24:10.080 down yeah I mean you you don't want to
02:24:12.720 say like so there there's a lot of Merit
02:24:15.399 to the economics of comparative
02:24:16.920 advantage like like
02:24:18.880 so if you complete self-sufficient what
02:24:21.399 that means is that you make all the
02:24:24.279 stuff yourself and and and and even if
02:24:26.720 some other country is really good at
02:24:28.160 making something you still make it
02:24:30.160 yourself and which means you're going to
02:24:31.560 have the inferior more costly product
02:24:33.359 domestically right um like Soviet Russia
02:24:37.399 yeah um like trade trade improves
02:24:41.080 Prosperity this is this is important um
02:24:44.479 so you you don't actually want to be
02:24:47.160 make everything yourself um and you can
02:24:50.720 you can run this like you can think of
02:24:52.279 this thought experiment on a on a sort
02:24:54.080 of a a m a micro scale and or small
02:24:56.840 scale and then expand that and say where
02:24:58.600 does the at at what point does the th
02:25:00.560 experiment no longer prove to be valid
02:25:02.600 now let's let's let's cons consider the
02:25:04.200 case of you as an individual imagine you
02:25:05.640 have to do everything yourself you had
02:25:07.000 to farm you had to uh grow chickens you
02:25:11.240 got if you want eggs you've got to build
02:25:13.399 your own house you've got to do your own
02:25:15.600 uh electrical repair your own Plumbing
02:25:17.920 everything yourself everything
02:25:21.439 how now that would be impossible okay
02:25:23.600 now let's expand it to okay you've got
02:25:25.560 there's 10 people now you're going to
02:25:27.000 have some some uh specialization of
02:25:29.840 tasks okay maybe one person can be
02:25:31.479 really good at you know uh construction
02:25:33.880 another person could be good at farming
02:25:35.479 it's like but it's still you know 10
02:25:37.600 people's not enough so like let's go to
02:25:39.000 100 people now let's go to 100 million
02:25:40.600 people now let's go to a billion people
02:25:42.600 and you still get the the economics of
02:25:45.479 of uh specialization like like
02:25:48.080 specialization of Labor where people
02:25:49.800 become expert at particular things still
02:25:52.000 matters at a billion people or at 8
02:25:55.080 billion people which is Earth so you
02:25:57.120 still want um you you do want
02:26:00.720 specialization of Labor you do want uh
02:26:02.800 countries to be really good at a
02:26:04.040 particular thing and make that thing um
02:26:06.399 also it encourages Innovation if you
02:26:07.720 have competition if the Germans are
02:26:09.200 making better cars we have to make
02:26:10.640 better cars we have to compete with them
02:26:12.240 which is like one of the things that
02:26:13.479 happen during like the 80s and 90s and
02:26:15.920 America was making crap cars and Germany
02:26:17.840 was making much better ones yeah exactly
02:26:19.960 I mean the yeah the Japanese car I mean
02:26:24.560 yeah I mean basically American car
02:26:26.000 industry got really lazy in the 70s uh
02:26:28.359 and and80s and and then the Japanese and
02:26:30.600 German car companies came in and just
02:26:32.319 cleaned the clock you know um and uh
02:26:36.920 there was like a an old joke from the
02:26:39.840 that that is kind of telling um it's a
02:26:43.200 very old joke um where it's like why did
02:26:45.479 the Japanese car companies beat the
02:26:46.720 American car companies um well it's like
02:26:49.160 well the in the Japanese car company you
02:26:51.439 had eight people rowing and one person
02:26:53.479 steering and in the American Car Company
02:26:55.479 you had eight people steering and one
02:26:57.040 person rowing if this was a boat so
02:26:59.000 imagine the boat race yeah boat race
02:27:02.319 Japanese boat you got eight people
02:27:03.359 rowing one person steering in the
02:27:05.399 American
02:27:06.840 boat um you got you got one person
02:27:09.200 rowing and eight people steering and
02:27:11.680 when the American Car Company loses the
02:27:13.720 race they they fire the
02:27:16.800 rower and it's like okay that was
02:27:19.040 actually kind of true yeah one of things
02:27:21.120 like everyone wants to do the be the
02:27:22.439 boss andone everybody wants to do the
02:27:23.640 work type of thing yeah um one thing
02:27:26.160 that a lot of people are concerned about
02:27:27.840 is uh the potential disruption that's
02:27:30.560 going to come about with Automation and
02:27:33.240 AI that a lot of these jobs
02:27:35.880 manufacturing jobs uh Teamsters all that
02:27:38.720 stuff is going to be
02:27:39.840 eliminated what what do I mean you're at
02:27:42.479 the Forefront of this so how do you see
02:27:45.000 this playing out and what do you think
02:27:47.279 that can be done to mitigate uh a lot of
02:27:50.800 the loss of purpose that a lot of people
02:27:53.319 are going to feel loss of income
02:27:55.600 obviously Universal basic income is
02:27:57.240 being floated about but that seems to me
02:27:59.880 to only be part of the problem the
02:28:02.439 another big part of the problem is
02:28:03.600 people losing a sense of
02:28:06.399 purpose yeah now we're talking about
02:28:08.640 something which is still pretty far in
02:28:11.760 the future you know like um how far do
02:28:13.640 you think it
02:28:15.920 is well I mean it's it's probably I
02:28:19.200 don't know 15 20 years years of a thing
02:28:21.960 um so we've got like immediate issues
02:28:25.880 we've got short-term issues that are I
02:28:28.240 know 1 to three years medium-term issues
02:28:30.760 like 5 to 10 years longer term issues
02:28:32.560 which are like maybe 20 years um longer
02:28:35.200 term I think there is this question if
02:28:37.600 if you have ai and Robotics how do you
02:28:39.279 find meaning in life if the computer can
02:28:41.359 do everything better than you can and
02:28:42.960 the robot can do everything better than
02:28:44.160 you can but we're we're still we got a
02:28:47.600 long way to go before that and we're you
02:28:49.319 know um
02:28:50.960 and I do think it's like 80% likely to
02:28:52.800 be a good outcome like maybe 90
02:28:56.240 um
02:28:57.920 so I think everyone's going to have
02:28:59.920 their own like personal robot like and
02:29:02.200 and I think at a certain point like
02:29:03.800 wouldn't you want to have your own
02:29:05.080 personal c3p R2-D2 so it's going to be
02:29:08.399 essentially just like everyone has their
02:29:09.920 own phone yeah everyone will have their
02:29:11.880 own robot
02:29:13.800 buddy like literally well it would be
02:29:16.720 great if it protected you like if you
02:29:18.640 walked down the street of New York City
02:29:20.200 have a Terminator with you uh I know
02:29:22.160 about the Terminator hopefully we got to
02:29:23.600 avoid we don't want this to be the plot
02:29:25.439 of James James Cameron you know we would
02:29:27.920 more more more Gene rotenberry than than
02:29:30.520 James Cameron uh movie situation but it
02:29:33.240 would be fascinating to watch some rich
02:29:35.240 person walk down the street of New York
02:29:36.680 City flanked by two giant Tesla robots
02:29:39.600 Jack Tesla robots were there protect
02:29:41.600 something that just fully robots so many
02:29:43.520 fully robot there to protect you from a
02:29:46.160 bad neighborhood yeah that would be very
02:29:49.040 interesting
02:29:50.720 I mean this is you could potentially see
02:29:52.560 that yeah um restaurants would probably
02:29:55.240 have no robot rules they can't bring a
02:29:58.520 robot yeah leave your robot stand leave
02:30:01.160 your robot outside your robot standing
02:30:02.840 by the
02:30:03.880 table man the future's going to be wild
02:30:06.240 it's going to be wild yeah yeah it's
02:30:08.520 going to be really
02:30:10.279 unpredictable like uh I don't think I
02:30:12.520 mean you probably have a pretty good
02:30:14.000 sense of it but I think most people
02:30:16.680 don't understand the wave that's coming
02:30:19.200 yeah and I was kind of kind of
02:30:20.600 completely drown society and change it
02:30:24.160 forever
02:30:26.560 yeah I mean it's we we have like I said
02:30:29.800 it's it's not like it's not going to
02:30:31.880 happen like overnight but it's 20 years
02:30:34.439 from now I'm like I think it's like 20
02:30:36.600 years from now I think there's going to
02:30:37.439 be more more humanoid robots than are
02:30:39.960 humans really yes more humanized what
02:30:44.200 that's so crazy like so that's like more
02:30:45.920 guns we have more guns than people in
02:30:47.600 America we have more robots than people
02:30:49.439 in America as well yes you have a bunch
02:30:51.880 of old robots nobody wants anymore I
02:30:55.640 guess um early early pions or something
02:31:00.200 um in in a historical
02:31:03.200 timeline 20 years in the past is not
02:31:06.080 been that big of a deal you know I mean
02:31:07.760 this a big deal but you go from like
02:31:09.279 1900 1920 not that big of a deal 1920
02:31:13.240 1940 kind of a big deal 1940 1960 things
02:31:16.720 start getting weird 60 to 80 wow that's
02:31:19.319 a big difference 80 to 2000 holy [ __ ]
02:31:22.000 now you have the internet 2000 to 2020
02:31:25.000 whoa this is nuts you have propaganda
02:31:28.640 social media YouTube
02:31:31.560 streaming 20 years from now like what
02:31:35.600 are we even talking about M it's going
02:31:38.840 to be that much of a shift like it's all
02:31:41.720 accelerating and we're in the middle of
02:31:43.600 it so it's very difficult to sort of
02:31:45.439 like feel it while it's happening it
02:31:48.279 kind of just feels like life
02:31:51.000 and you just get adapted to the
02:31:55.279 changes
02:31:56.920 yeah I mean people's phones at this
02:31:59.279 point are a supercomputer in their
02:32:00.520 pocket like an article that can answer
02:32:01.960 any questions people just take it for
02:32:03.240 granted yeah it's normal yeah they get
02:32:06.319 mad if it doesn't work yeah it's like
02:32:07.640 Louis CK's joke about using your phone
02:32:09.240 when you're on a plane [ __ ] piece of
02:32:11.120 [ __ ] like you're in the sky floating in
02:32:14.479 the air and now it will work with
02:32:15.840 starlink too what's that it will work
02:32:18.000 with starlink the starlink the starlink
02:32:20.479 connection uh it'll be like being on the
02:32:22.279 ground well I was telling you how I used
02:32:23.760 starlink when I was in Utah I was in the
02:32:25.600 mountains of Utah there was no cell
02:32:27.399 phone service anywhere near and we had
02:32:29.600 full YouTube we had text messages
02:32:34.319 FaceTime everything phone calls it was
02:32:37.359 nuts yeah and it was it's this big as
02:32:39.760 that cigar box yeah it's crazy it's so
02:32:42.520 light when I brought it out there like
02:32:43.880 that's it I this is it let just plug it
02:32:45.560 in and the guys I was in Camp with they
02:32:47.640 like this is crazy yeah the whole Camp
02:32:50.359 was like sharing it so like 10 people
02:32:53.040 yeah using the the Wi-Fi signal right
02:32:55.040 it's nuts
02:32:57.120 yep and then you know that's the
02:33:00.760 beginning I mean you what you're at
02:33:02.720 right now is like what version this is
02:33:04.920 starlink mini right so this is like a
02:33:07.040 very small version how how much smaller
02:33:09.000 can it scale down from that well there's
02:33:11.640 a certain uh area that you need like the
02:33:14.279 bigger the area the it's the more you
02:33:17.479 can like like bandwidth yeah because
02:33:20.399 you're you're like trying to catch these
02:33:21.880 like photons essentially so you can
02:33:23.680 think of the like the you know the area
02:33:26.840 of the of of the of the antenna is like
02:33:31.520 the more area you have the more photons
02:33:34.080 you can catch um so but but we have a
02:33:38.000 direct to sell capability as well that
02:33:39.520 we're just uh We've we've been launching
02:33:41.600 that will turn on I probably in a few
02:33:43.960 months um that that'll actually connect
02:33:46.840 directly to a cell phone unmodified U
02:33:49.240 but but because the cell phone is a much
02:33:50.680 worse antenna than a dedicated antenna
02:33:52.479 it'll be about a 100 times less
02:33:54.040 bandwidth but still you know you'll be
02:33:55.479 able to like do text messages you know
02:33:58.160 pictures like medium resolution videos
02:34:00.399 that kind of thing one of the cool
02:34:01.760 things about the new phone the new uh
02:34:04.560 iPhone the iPhone 16 uh I got it and I
02:34:07.040 was in the mountains last month and I
02:34:08.800 was text messaging with satellites yeah
02:34:11.080 iMessages right and receiving them but
02:34:13.600 just text yeah just text yeah but still
02:34:16.000 pretty impressive yeah yeah I mean what
02:34:19.880 are we what are we going to be looking
02:34:21.160 at 100 years from now I mean when you
02:34:24.479 100 years from now I hope civilization's
02:34:26.600 around yeah that'll be a win yeah yeah
02:34:30.479 what what are the chances that we [ __ ]
02:34:32.359 this whole thing
02:34:34.120 up
02:34:38.279 50% it's hard to say I
02:34:41.000 mean
02:34:46.000 um I guess not like I don't think
02:34:48.080 civilization will be totally destroyed
02:34:50.080 unless there's like some really massive
02:34:51.920 Global th nuclear war um but
02:34:56.319 uh I mean you Stephen Hawking he would
02:34:59.359 say that there's like a one at least a
02:35:00.640 1% chance of total Annihilation every
02:35:02.840 Century that was his rough estimate um
02:35:07.279 but there's a much bigger chance of
02:35:08.760 civilization being less capable than it
02:35:11.200 is today so you say like well because
02:35:14.720 you look at say you know these various
02:35:16.960 civilizations throughout history um
02:35:19.880 whether it's the like ancient samarians
02:35:21.760 or the you know Egyptians the Romans
02:35:26.000 like they they there's like a life cycle
02:35:27.880 to civilization they reached a peak and
02:35:30.040 then they started
02:35:32.120 subsiding um
02:35:35.160 so so I think a bigger question is like
02:35:37.520 will will will our technology level be
02:35:39.760 better or worse than it is today in 100
02:35:41.720 years
02:35:45.240 um I think it's probably going to be
02:35:47.319 better
02:35:51.760 I I think but any estimates are are
02:35:53.720 going to be so there's so many
02:35:56.000 dependencies like like an estimate I
02:35:58.399 think is I'm not sure it has any any
02:36:00.720 meaning um because it's like there's so
02:36:02.479 many things that can happen in 100 years
02:36:04.319 well The Logical hope is always that
02:36:06.359 people pay attention to history and they
02:36:08.240 recognize the patterns and how
02:36:10.000 civilizations have collapsed yeah and
02:36:12.240 they recognize what's going wrong in the
02:36:14.920 current society and say we have to do
02:36:17.560 our best to mitigate this and we've seen
02:36:19.880 this happen before let's course correct
02:36:22.880 and let's sort of manage what we've got
02:36:25.640 here now and maintain what we've got
02:36:27.319 here now because it's pretty
02:36:28.479 extraordinary yes this is what we're
02:36:30.960 hoping for with this election this is
02:36:33.319 what we're hoping for with the future is
02:36:35.880 that people can see we are on a bad path
02:36:39.160 and something can be done right now and
02:36:41.279 it might be the only moment in history
02:36:43.040 where this is possible because if they
02:36:45.040 do lock the country down and make it so
02:36:47.920 that voting is kind of [ __ ] you're
02:36:49.600 voting for primaries and the people that
02:36:51.080 they put in the primaries they're
02:36:52.080 controlling that in the first place you
02:36:53.840 don't really have democracy anymore you
02:36:55.800 don't really have Choice exactly you
02:36:57.600 don't really have freedom that's
02:37:00.439 right yeah I think freedom is is
02:37:02.600 fundamentally at stake in the election
02:37:04.399 tomorrow and we'll know we'll know I
02:37:05.920 think we'll know by the end of day
02:37:06.920 tomorrow I don't think it's going to
02:37:07.840 take it's not going to be like days
02:37:09.399 after the election I think we'll know
02:37:10.319 tomorrow are you optimistic I I am I'm
02:37:13.200 currently optimistic but um the the
02:37:16.319 biggest Factor here is that men need to
02:37:19.120 vote that is the biggest issue so um I I
02:37:24.359 don't know what what the reason is but
02:37:26.120 but men just vote at a much lower rate
02:37:28.319 than women I think it's like 9% right
02:37:30.240 someone just told me that today it's
02:37:31.880 it's a it's a big difference um like and
02:37:35.880 uh I'm just like saying this is a
02:37:37.640 message to the men out there vote like
02:37:39.920 your life depends on it because I think
02:37:41.279 it does vote vote tomorrow like your
02:37:43.960 life depends on it nothing is more
02:37:46.040 important I agree yeah listen man thank
02:37:48.800 you for being here I know you're busy as
02:37:50.359 [ __ ] so I really appreciate your time
02:37:52.040 and again I I thank you so much for
02:37:54.920 buying Twitter because I really do
02:37:56.640 believe that you've changed the course
02:37:57.840 of history I I really do think you've
02:38:00.120 you've created a pathway where people
02:38:02.200 can actually Express themselves and
02:38:04.960 actually exchange information that
02:38:06.920 really didn't exist before and I think
02:38:08.880 it was dangerous it is it is dangerous
02:38:11.760 hopefully I live long enough to see my
02:38:13.840 kids grow up and people on
02:38:15.640 Mars that's that be that's that's all
02:38:18.319 I'm asking for here I don't think that's
02:38:20.279 too much to
02:38:21.880 happen thank you very much appreciate
02:38:24.439 thank you pleasure all right bye
