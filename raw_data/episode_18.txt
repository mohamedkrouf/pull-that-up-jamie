00:01:26.759 engineer Robin CPS better burger know
00:01:28.710 and I ended up kidnapping a [ __ ]
00:01:30.360 he said I walked on the polls I was all
00:01:33.450 in with Anthony Robbins you know those
00:01:35.220 really because I worked for a Subaru
00:01:37.979 dealerships or Subaru paid for you to go
00:01:40.860 to Anthony Robbins seminars so they
00:01:43.950 would give me like three bills for the
00:01:45.270 day for per diem I would go to Denver
00:01:47.520 and do the Anthony Robbins seminar do it
00:01:50.220 you should be a Subaru spokesperson
00:01:52.020 who's more loyal to Subaru than you
00:01:53.970 nobody he [ __ ] loves Subarus love him
00:01:57.140 love him I just cannot because he lived
00:02:01.020 in Boulder I lived in Aspen
00:02:03.420 yes and I saw vans I saw every type of
00:02:07.829 high level costs been around and you
00:02:11.340 just lose control
00:02:12.380 and I give a lose control on Colorado I
00:02:14.630 didn't but I did respond for a bunch of
00:02:16.700 times yeah it wasn't fun it's not
00:02:18.980 whenever you're driving in so it's
00:02:20.810 touch-and-go
00:02:21.560 you could get patches of ice and in
00:02:24.320 Colorado at night you got a thing called
00:02:26.180 black ice and you know I remember being
00:02:29.600 I worked at the Crestwood I was security
00:02:31.970 and I had to pick people up at the
00:02:33.710 airport at night and I [ __ ] did
00:02:36.500 everything I could to get out of that
00:02:37.850 job because when I was in a van with
00:02:39.650 people doing the speed limit
00:02:41.600 no alcohol you know me I just hit black
00:02:44.750 ice and the thing started spinning and
00:02:46.820 you don't know where you're gonna land
00:02:48.260 you have no idea I was a you acquire it
00:02:50.630 so you guys wire and I were on the way
00:02:52.190 to the airport in Ohio and we cross over
00:02:54.800 a bridge and bridges where you get it
00:02:56.330 because there's no ground underneath it
00:02:58.070 so things freeze quicker we went over
00:03:00.320 this bridge just we just got lucky
00:03:03.260 nothing happened we both went alright
00:03:05.210 you know it stopped where we were facing
00:03:07.460 the wrong way but there was no one on
00:03:08.720 the road cuz it was early we were headed
00:03:09.950 back to the airport and we just got
00:03:11.870 packed in wine and just like okay I
00:03:13.280 remember this I remember this like all
00:03:15.170 the sudden you got no power you know I
00:03:16.850 love German technology I love to look a
00:03:19.070 lot of sport cars and everything like
00:03:20.660 that but one I there's been nights
00:03:22.820 happen at ten years ago I had a gig in
00:03:25.160 Irvine and it was raining one of those
00:03:28.100 January and cot in California just
00:03:30.530 coming down I mean you couldn't see in
00:03:32.570 front and cause a bulldog and I'm doing
00:03:35.270 75 minutes ooh why is a Subaru so good
00:03:38.330 at that what is the big deal about
00:03:39.530 Subarus what I first started with like I
00:03:41.959 had never sold the car before I was a
00:03:44.030 detailer and I became a French at the
00:03:46.250 guy at Subaru and he bust my balls every
00:03:49.370 day's name was Peter Pan dolphin Florida
00:03:52.360 [Music]
00:03:55.780 Florida went all the way up to Colorado
00:03:58.300 to sell cars and he became man and I got
00:04:02.060 I was properly introduced in those days
00:04:05.180 they gave you 1,500 bucks the first
00:04:07.940 month and they trained you for two weeks
00:04:09.530 on cars I knew nothing about the car
00:04:12.140 like when you had that car in the axle
00:04:15.410 fell off you got rid of it because
00:04:17.540 you're not a car guy you're not gonna
00:04:19.220 get up on Saturdays and go to the Splore
00:04:21.200 and find the piece from 1966 come
00:04:24.590 it just some people have that love that
00:04:27.620 [ __ ]
00:04:27.980 Tim Al and Jay Leno Oh Gabriel I love
00:04:30.560 them for that I don't have that gift so
00:04:33.620 when I was introduced to the super I'm
00:04:35.630 like yeah whatever it's just another
00:04:37.910 [ __ ] car and then I saw snowstorms
00:04:41.510 and I saw how people reacted to superoes
00:04:45.020 in Boulder it's either Subaru or a
00:04:48.050 [ __ ] 4runner yeah that's it I'm sorry
00:04:51.410 I knew that said something you know once
00:04:53.419 the snow drops that September snowstorm
00:04:55.910 it's super-super was the first car that
00:04:58.340 has an engine sideways the engine isn't
00:05:01.940 in like usual cause that was the secret
00:05:04.820 about Subaru engine side it's it's I've
00:05:08.240 seen a few engines like that what do
00:05:09.770 they call that in line is something like
00:05:12.350 now in line is straight right that's
00:05:13.790 like a BMW they have solid word for it I
00:05:15.860 have it's super technology started there
00:05:18.950 and then when I started selling Subarus
00:05:21.350 and had a GL ten I was really impressed
00:05:23.360 with because what it like let you do is
00:05:25.400 if you went up if you won up Lee Hill
00:05:28.070 Road okay and you made the left to go
00:05:32.030 down into your property and there was
00:05:35.000 snow you could press a button and the
00:05:37.280 shock absorbers would fill up and your
00:05:39.770 car would rise above C to go through the
00:05:42.050 snow so all those little things the only
00:05:44.479 night I had that way back then 1988-89
00:05:47.660 the GL pens the only knock Subaru had
00:05:51.320 was that if you had a stick you couldn't
00:05:54.020 keep your hand on it you couldn't keep
00:05:56.510 your handling right so if I'm driving a
00:05:58.100 stick boom I'm a woman - right I'm
00:06:00.770 injury I got a kept my hand off it I
00:06:03.050 could only the clutch cable that was the
00:06:06.440 only knock they had so the question
00:06:08.539 would break it would break if you kept
00:06:10.190 your hand huh I had one of those break
00:06:12.500 on me once yes so you have to go one
00:06:14.300 then two then three then four I had to
00:06:17.690 actually break him twice once I got
00:06:19.490 stuck in second gear and I managed to
00:06:20.990 drive to a parking lot and get towed
00:06:22.490 that was in I had a 2005 or something
00:06:26.570 like that
00:06:26.930 2004 2005 Porsche they just kept
00:06:30.500 breaking and the thing that kept
00:06:33.380 breaking was that that thing with the
00:06:35.479 clutch and also the fuel pump
00:06:38.029 see I was a GL 10 sedan I'm talking
00:06:40.699 about the wagon the doodle up wagon was
00:06:43.429 just a brilliant automobile and then I
00:06:46.369 started selling Toyotas those things are
00:06:48.139 still on the road just on the road guys
00:06:49.969 and this is what I'm saying about the
00:06:51.679 American bow I like the Subaru because I
00:06:54.619 respect what they do with the American
00:06:56.360 dollar
00:06:56.959 well they do they give you $1 worth for
00:06:59.539 $1 all right
00:07:00.769 they really do for the American who's
00:07:02.689 really looking for a [ __ ] car to last
00:07:05.539 I've gone in to Douglas Toyota and have
00:07:08.749 seen trucks with a half of a million
00:07:10.879 miles on it I'll tell you a truck that
00:07:14.179 says a lot
00:07:14.959 hmm when you're an American and you're a
00:07:17.089 construction guy you know you're putting
00:07:18.949 them bids in bah-bah-bah do you know
00:07:20.629 Matt Farah smoking tire do you know that
00:07:23.569 no he's a big fan of yours he loves
00:07:26.360 comedy he's got this great YouTube
00:07:28.009 channel it's all about cars and they had
00:07:31.069 a car a Lexus that they took - a million
00:07:33.019 miles he had a million mile Lexus now
00:07:35.839 who makes life's at the end of the day
00:07:37.279 Oh des what the [ __ ] could we do that's
00:07:39.319 what I'm saying
00:07:40.069 so when I had three Lexuses over the
00:07:42.409 course of my life never had a single
00:07:43.550 problem zero problems they just they
00:07:45.679 just work didn't always work they just
00:07:47.479 work all cars are so amazing now it's
00:07:49.879 like the the the bar is set so high that
00:07:52.489 if you just get like us like if you get
00:07:54.499 a Mustang GT just a Mustang GT today
00:07:57.739 which is like very reasonable like I
00:08:01.039 think a Ford Mustang GT tell me how much
00:08:02.719 one of those [ __ ] things cost but
00:08:04.969 it's got performance that you couldn't
00:08:07.759 even imagine 20 years ago and it's
00:08:10.219 probably under $50,000 it's probably 40
00:08:12.439 grand how much of those 26 26 26 hours
00:08:17.449 is that for the regular Mustang or the
00:08:19.069 GT I say it is my tectum GT but it says
00:08:22.429 regular home okay so that's where I
00:08:23.749 think the regular one might have a
00:08:24.949 six-cylinder I'm not sure I think they
00:08:26.629 still do that so I might be wrong about
00:08:28.909 that premium fastback starts at 39 okay
00:08:32.149 the and that's the one with the v8 right
00:08:34.519 that's the coyote v8 it's a 5-liter v8
00:08:37.990 [ __ ] rip wicked powerful like 460
00:08:41.599 horsepower I mean the power that you get
00:08:43.818 with 40,000 45,000 dollars today it's
00:08:47.540 just insane they keep getting better and
00:08:49.250 better and better it's like where are
00:08:50.660 they gonna code these well
00:08:51.680 and the leases are great the lease is a
00:08:54.470 great delete the deals they're giving me
00:08:56.660 now I mean a buddy of mine just bought a
00:08:58.940 Connie how to point half whatever
00:09:02.710 interest rate oh you know four point I
00:09:05.930 have mediocre credit it's a time to buy
00:09:09.080 a car yeah yeah whatever the [ __ ] you
00:09:11.000 want Wow cars a good dog that's that
00:09:13.070 yeah it's like you can't make a shitty
00:09:14.450 car anymore like America went through a
00:09:16.820 time period we just made dog [ __ ] cars
00:09:19.100 and everybody knew that they broke and
00:09:21.380 everybody was like looking buy American
00:09:23.060 cars you you're gonna buy something that
00:09:24.500 it's gonna cost the same amount but it's
00:09:26.360 not gonna last as long and the Japanese
00:09:28.459 just took the Germans they just took
00:09:29.839 over it doesn't open then Lee Iacocca
00:09:32.000 brought it back with the cake off you
00:09:34.700 know it's the most hilarious country
00:09:36.320 that's the cars my people the Italian a
00:09:39.920 single car that's reliable when we had
00:09:42.800 the conversation about my buddy who had
00:09:44.510 the the Italian car he went he went
00:09:47.690 crazy I'm gonna keep it in my roots the
00:09:51.140 car is still in the garage
00:09:53.180 bro rusty [ __ ] the Bugatti or
00:09:56.839 whatever the [ __ ] Perry the new ones you
00:09:58.700 can drive like a new one they're
00:10:00.890 actually reliable for two weeks no no no
00:10:03.290 no the new ones apparently it's like
00:10:04.880 everything else they got to a point
00:10:06.680 where they just had to have better yes I
00:10:09.620 do de triumph we grew up on the triumphs
00:10:12.709 the thing by Volkswagen
00:10:14.360 I don't remember things by Volkswagen
00:10:17.000 was that their little van thing it was a
00:10:19.100 little van thing that that they're very
00:10:21.320 there's like 10 left if you got a thing
00:10:23.150 somebody'll give you a million dollars
00:10:24.920 really they had a Subaru made a car
00:10:27.440 called the JA that's it
00:10:28.850 that's the thing Subaru made a car
00:10:31.339 called adjusted three cylinder just a
00:10:34.670 beat just to compete with the Hyundai
00:10:36.920 when the Hyundai came out with the mutt
00:10:38.510 'mobile in 87 my Hyundai changed a game
00:10:41.390 and they came out with the Istana what
00:10:44.000 I'm like a little four-door car is 160
00:10:47.480 you know 150 down 150 a month busted the
00:10:51.230 car industry Subaru yeah Pete everybody
00:10:54.440 had to drop those tin cans just to
00:10:56.990 compete those there was a lot of people
00:10:58.940 driving those Hyundai's when they first
00:11:00.440 came out I thought it was so cheaper but
00:11:02.089 buddy of my god 50 150 a month
00:11:04.840 yeah all day long a buddy of mine called
00:11:07.720 Monday that I used to drive deliver
00:11:10.060 papers with then he was telling me he's
00:11:11.860 like look look these [ __ ] Koreans man
00:11:13.900 when they get into something they know
00:11:15.520 what they're doing
00:11:16.210 like if they're gonna jump into the car
00:11:17.560 market that that's a disciplined group
00:11:19.480 of people if they're gonna jump into the
00:11:21.460 car market they're gonna make a badass
00:11:22.480 car whoa listen and they're very
00:11:24.070 reliable Mitsubishi for example
00:11:26.110 Mitsubishi people hate Mitsubishi
00:11:28.660 American why the hate myths of issue
00:11:30.370 because Mitsubishi made the parts that
00:11:32.320 were in the magnets that the American is
00:11:34.900 one up against some World War two oh
00:11:36.580 really so if you try to sell a [ __ ]
00:11:38.680 those those guys are all gone
00:11:41.020 knocking that rest in peace but when you
00:11:43.990 sold the car to a guy that did the
00:11:46.450 reading I like there was certain
00:11:47.830 Chrysler's that had Mitsubishi parts
00:11:51.270 Ford had Mitsubishi parts on it because
00:11:54.070 mr. B she's like the greatest biggest
00:11:55.890 thing of car parts buses everybody has
00:11:59.140 Mitsubishi parts on that car something
00:12:01.510 belongs to Mitsubishi so if you had a
00:12:04.540 Mitsubishi you're a bad person
00:12:06.370 no no no no so when most some Americans
00:12:09.520 old school veterans you know those guys
00:12:11.380 that wear the jackets with the act with
00:12:13.330 them when they come to see a car if you
00:12:16.450 show them the Chrysler a certain type of
00:12:18.339 Chrysler they go nah they got a
00:12:21.370 Mitsubishi [ __ ] can well tailpipe
00:12:23.890 that makes sense because that's how
00:12:25.570 pissed off they were about because the
00:12:27.610 mag's would shoot down the Americans or
00:12:29.320 somebody with something I get historic
00:12:31.360 thing but that Mitsubishi got into the
00:12:33.339 business
00:12:34.410 Mitsubishi but still along unlike the
00:12:36.880 eighties the late eighties they came out
00:12:38.680 with that [ __ ] car the Eclipse hmm
00:12:41.700 remember the Eclipse I remember that
00:12:44.230 yeah a little [ __ ] car I had a
00:12:46.150 Mitsubishi at one point I have story on
00:12:48.190 every day yeah because they were cheap
00:12:51.070 you know you go until you go into Toyota
00:12:53.800 plans to buy your money you didn't speak
00:12:57.670 to that dodge used to sell their version
00:13:00.970 of the story on it was the conquest
00:13:03.930 Dodge had the conquest TSI and it was
00:13:07.480 their version of the star and it was the
00:13:09.190 same car it was one of the rare times in
00:13:11.410 history where two car companies have the
00:13:13.720 exact same car the exact same car one
00:13:17.560 was the conch
00:13:18.430 was a story on that was it yes that red
00:13:22.810 one right looks exactly like my buddy
00:13:24.640 Jimmy to tell you yep my buddy Jimmy had
00:13:26.740 one exactly like that when we were like
00:13:30.670 21 this is why it's very hard for a guy
00:13:33.430 like me to fall for fans especially for
00:13:35.589 cars because I've seen a lot of fan I
00:13:37.779 remember Suzuki Samurai mm-hmm how many
00:13:40.450 [ __ ] killed this is uki samurai
00:13:42.339 was like the scooter you know these
00:13:44.170 jerk-offs at the school just today
00:13:45.640 thinking that that cool huh does the
00:13:47.650 zookie samurai came around and it
00:13:49.930 started tipping over
00:13:51.839 things started tipping over
00:13:54.100 but again take corners with the one
00:13:56.350 feels like a sports car thing weighed 8
00:13:59.260 pounds
00:13:59.890 I had a friend's tipping them over they
00:14:01.930 were made of [ __ ] ten and then one
00:14:04.390 goofy down you know 150 a month and for
00:14:08.100 [ __ ] an extra 25 hours that a guy
00:14:10.690 with a fan because you would die in
00:14:12.490 these things people would die what the
00:14:15.010 [ __ ] yeah they sell these in the Studio
00:14:17.950 City
00:14:18.279 what is it it's a electric car that's
00:14:20.260 like a one-seater it's a three wheel
00:14:21.640 one-seater Electra meccanica I don't
00:14:24.400 have to say it I think that's it Electra
00:14:26.500 dad it's crazy and it's a one-person car
00:14:28.390 yeah it's a bro it doubles as a casket
00:14:32.760 that's what's great about that [ __ ]
00:14:35.080 car that your family saves 10 G's buy a
00:14:37.330 casket they just bury in that [ __ ]
00:14:39.820 thing but if you think about if you have
00:14:41.470 to get around everywhere it's just you
00:14:43.480 most days and something like this is
00:14:45.490 cheap what is the difference between
00:14:47.290 being in that and being in a big truck
00:14:50.080 where all that [ __ ] empty [ __ ]
00:14:54.430 thing you ever drive past one of these
00:14:56.800 idiots and you had a light and you
00:14:58.480 actually look at them and you're like
00:15:00.310 you're in his mind he's thinking he's
00:15:04.060 the coolest guy in the [ __ ] world
00:15:05.620 that guy thinks he's [ __ ] Ricky
00:15:07.180 Gervais that's actually a cool looking
00:15:09.520 one
00:15:09.730 look at that fronts good hood scoop Joe
00:15:11.650 that's a casket light no it's a hood
00:15:15.640 scoop is that their high beams looks
00:15:18.400 like a headlights but I think that's
00:15:19.990 actually a real hood scoop for some
00:15:21.850 strange lasting piece over it yeah what
00:15:23.709 is that is that clear plastic over it
00:15:25.870 could be because it's inside but I don't
00:15:28.180 know I'm so crazy that's like the rx-7
00:15:30.520 the arcs
00:15:31.340 was a casket for two was it remember the
00:15:33.529 Mazda ah yeah I [ __ ] hated that car
00:15:37.130 you know why that's why because I was
00:15:39.230 coming home on January 1st and I was one
00:15:41.990 of the first people on the site and I
00:15:45.830 was I don't know I don't want to sad and
00:15:47.810 I was tripping on something I was on
00:15:49.490 some type of drug but I wasn't over the
00:15:51.350 hill I was still alert and we were like
00:15:55.190 maybe the third car there and it was a
00:15:57.290 Mazda then hit a pole
00:15:59.150 head-on and it was split down the middle
00:16:02.360 all the way to the windshield and I
00:16:04.790 could hear the girl yelling oh my god
00:16:07.400 and we were there the fire department
00:16:09.560 came ambulance a couple heroes came out
00:16:12.560 he was dead on arrival
00:16:15.380 they saw the car and that's why I don't
00:16:18.140 like those little cars their caskets
00:16:20.270 that's the caskets hmm in those days and
00:16:23.630 after that I'd never gotten to her
00:16:24.980 except my buddy the devil had an rx-7
00:16:27.290 were they the ones with the rotary
00:16:28.850 engine I don't know as Mazda has there's
00:16:32.630 a sports car company that uniquely has a
00:16:35.420 rotary engine it's a different kind of
00:16:37.760 engine it's not like cylinders said it
00:16:40.900 is Mazda yeah they got a different kind
00:16:44.570 of engine to touch my car more modern
00:16:48.620 Mazdas like mm maybe no no it was like
00:16:54.680 90s like before okay it was before I
00:16:57.290 moved to California see look at that
00:17:00.500 thing
00:17:00.980 that's how the engine works instead of
00:17:04.400 having a bunch of Pistons it's got this
00:17:06.410 big [ __ ] thing in the middle of it
00:17:09.790 like I wish I understood engines to know
00:17:12.679 why this is that different engines have
00:17:16.220 yeah real car people must be going crazy
00:17:20.929 I'm sorry I don't know [ __ ] so we're
00:17:24.650 watching this video that says Mazda rx-7
00:17:26.660 rotary engine how it works and it's
00:17:28.550 describing how it works it's a very
00:17:31.460 strange video were you watching this
00:17:32.780 thing rolling around inside of an oval
00:17:35.030 looks like a big oval engine container
00:17:38.810 it's very different but it's very fast
00:17:42.370 it was the one that this guy had
00:17:45.110 guess like I'm saying I'm think it's 93
00:17:47.059 or something like that it was really
00:17:48.710 fast
00:17:49.340 and it really handled really well too
00:17:51.670 but it was a very light car these things
00:17:56.270 are weird when like rotary engine that's
00:17:58.640 weird like how come nobody else adopted
00:18:01.220 that just but it looks like a badass
00:18:02.780 watch you know see I didn't have a car
00:18:06.350 education but by selling cars and
00:18:09.650 Boulder I learned a lot now I forget
00:18:12.920 that stuff I'm not gonna lie there
00:18:14.299 because the the level of intelligence in
00:18:17.510 Boulder from the University when they
00:18:21.049 would come in the end I'm a boulder
00:18:22.730 let's at the end of the day University
00:18:24.500 Colorado you don't want to be an
00:18:25.820 astronaut you know that is that where
00:18:27.410 does like that's that's heavy-duty
00:18:29.240 Boulder they have like a whole thing
00:18:30.710 back there so those people move into
00:18:33.290 town between them and the Japanese that
00:18:36.410 move there they come to Subaru and they
00:18:39.080 ask very intelligent questions
00:18:41.059 completely different than a guy like you
00:18:43.309 me or Jamie will ask the same weird um
00:18:45.799 yes compared to what they will compared
00:18:48.860 to what they'd ask like what kind of
00:18:50.360 questions no velocity this that this and
00:18:55.070 I'd have to find these answers for them
00:18:58.360 because they were like astronauts I'd
00:19:01.160 have to go in there was no computers in
00:19:03.290 any [ __ ] ate like that I could go on
00:19:05.440 so I have to go on a brochure and really
00:19:09.679 go into it and then they take the
00:19:11.960 calculator out like there is type of
00:19:13.910 people so that's why I remember learning
00:19:17.390 as much as I could because there was so
00:19:20.000 intelligent when they'd come over
00:19:21.919 specially the Japanese guys they
00:19:23.900 couldn't speak that good English but
00:19:25.630 they would look at cause what's this
00:19:28.220 what's the wait that's what's really
00:19:30.980 amazing if you stop and think about the
00:19:32.570 creation of cars and how they've evolved
00:19:34.640 they keep getting better for a long time
00:19:36.260 they did it without the internet a long
00:19:38.059 time well some of them up the greatest
00:19:39.620 cars ever created pre-internet
00:19:41.660 you know there's just think about all
00:19:45.110 the various forms of sports cars and
00:19:49.120 911s all those different Corvettes that
00:19:52.220 came out all that [ __ ] was before the
00:19:53.570 internet they were just looking at each
00:19:56.210 other's pictures and
00:19:57.260 looking at magazines and everyone was
00:19:59.330 competing against each other to have the
00:20:01.070 best handling car the best looking car
00:20:02.929 best fuel efficiency things kept
00:20:04.610 shifting over the years like for 10
00:20:07.070 years in America they didn't make
00:20:08.389 anything good and for 10 years what
00:20:11.029 would what would you use the years from
00:20:14.019 American muscle cars when I say anything
00:20:16.190 good I mean like something that like a
00:20:18.100 muscle car lover other than the Trans Am
00:20:20.779 the Trans Am is the exception to the
00:20:22.220 rule
00:20:22.549 Trans Am they made some you know those
00:20:24.730 smoking the Bandit cars that people to
00:20:27.049 this day still want that was in the 70s
00:20:28.570 but from the 1960s like say 65 ish to
00:20:34.700 like 70 America couldn't be touched
00:20:37.370 those muscle cars were insane they just
00:20:40.399 kept pumping out cooler and cooler
00:20:42.230 shapes
00:20:43.010 what did classic driver drove he drove a
00:20:46.039 1968 fastback Mustang got a bad mother
00:20:48.860 phone yeah how bad a [ __ ] well
00:20:51.470 it's a beautiful car the design is put
00:20:54.350 the back end of the 68 Mustang is one of
00:20:56.840 the most underrated forms in all of
00:20:59.510 automotive design that's a 68 Shelby
00:21:02.000 that's different that's a gt500 is a
00:21:05.000 totally different shape the Shelby had a
00:21:07.070 completely different set of rear
00:21:08.179 taillights they had altered quite a bit
00:21:11.389 about the Shelby like the way it looks
00:21:13.669 in the front end as well there's regular
00:21:15.950 68 Mustang it just has this beautiful
00:21:17.750 like contoured rear end look at that
00:21:20.870 look at that that green car that is
00:21:23.269 that's like a real modern looking like
00:21:25.070 updated version of it real pretty you
00:21:26.840 know with a phenomenal deep green paint
00:21:29.750 job but look how good that rear looks
00:21:31.850 that's what he drove that's what he
00:21:34.010 drove [ __ ] look at that that is
00:21:35.690 Americana baby look at the tail end of
00:21:39.049 that [ __ ] vehicle man with the chrome
00:21:41.419 and the chrome bumpers and the red
00:21:44.600 headlights and the black behind look at
00:21:47.059 that [ __ ] car man no seat belt
00:21:50.110 well they had those ones around your
00:21:52.429 waist you like in the back you know
00:21:53.840 waking up but no there's no seat belt
00:21:55.490 about you bounced around like [ __ ]
00:21:56.720 rock back how many horsepower it's not
00:21:59.659 that much not that much man of a really
00:22:02.570 powerful car back then had like 350
00:22:05.090 horsepower like let's find out what was
00:22:07.070 the 1968 gt500 that was their mo
00:22:11.090 powerful one I wanna I'm gonna imagine
00:22:12.620 this had like 400 horsepower say 1968
00:22:17.200 just Shelby GT 500 horsepower 1968
00:22:21.950 Shelby GT because that was their what
00:22:23.900 they would do is they take it to Carroll
00:22:25.310 Shelby caliber we take the regular
00:22:28.040 Mustang just juice it the [ __ ] up more
00:22:31.130 power better handling better looks we're
00:22:35.300 on it perfect yeah now who were they
00:22:36.980 competing with like what was this is
00:22:39.920 Ford right yeah they were competing
00:22:42.140 against the Camaro at this point because
00:22:44.330 they made a garbage the car in the cold
00:22:45.920 back sort of the court that was like a
00:22:47.420 little bit of a different category
00:22:49.130 because it was a pure sports car where
00:22:50.840 this car had back seats so that's a 400
00:22:53.690 horsepower it's so to compare to the
00:22:56.990 Mustang of today the regular GT forget
00:23:00.740 about the new one they have a new gt500
00:23:03.620 that has like 760 horsepower the new
00:23:07.010 gt500 goes zero to 60 in like three
00:23:09.140 seconds it's a monstrous one where
00:23:11.120 they're making for that movie that just
00:23:12.320 came out that was it the Ford verse
00:23:14.240 Ferrari Oh
00:23:15.380 for the moment I don't know I think it
00:23:18.140 was that about race car I didn't see it
00:23:19.490 was about it was Shelby it was him
00:23:21.740 making that car I think like they had oh
00:23:23.300 really make it or two days demand [ __ ]
00:23:25.430 I didn't see well probably for the movie
00:23:27.170 they got juice that up right I don't
00:23:29.180 know the I told I thought they were race
00:23:31.460 cars though I didn't think they were
00:23:32.540 like these kind of cars it's like a GT
00:23:34.070 car
00:23:34.520 hey I don't know oh yeah this is the
00:23:37.250 gt500 maybe that's what that was for
00:23:38.870 yeah I think it's not even the gt500 I
00:23:41.240 think it's the gt40
00:23:42.410 which was their race car I think it's
00:23:44.330 because it's I'm pretty sure I saw in
00:23:45.860 the I didn't see the move not you - no I
00:23:47.510 think - aw I think it's a different GT I
00:23:50.000 think it's their actual racecar racecar
00:23:51.820 but the new one this Shelby has a new
00:23:55.400 gt500 it's a ridiculous car it's faster
00:23:59.330 around tracks than the new Corvette they
00:24:01.610 have a new Corvette this crazy rear
00:24:03.740 engined meet mid-engined rather
00:24:05.720 Corvettes the newest Corvette it's the
00:24:07.160 best Corvette ever and this gt500 is
00:24:09.530 even faster than that it's bonkers right
00:24:12.770 gt40 yeah it's a different kind of car
00:24:15.050 that's the car that's only for the
00:24:16.520 racetrack these guys these you're beat
00:24:20.030 you could buy a Shelby gt500 today you
00:24:22.820 walk out of a dealer showroom hi
00:24:24.500 hi do you know how to drive yes sir
00:24:26.630 here's my license like you don't have to
00:24:28.580 hardly know [ __ ] and they'll let you
00:24:30.230 just drive home and one of the most
00:24:33.020 preposterous automobiles ever offered to
00:24:36.440 man you just go pretty to a Ford
00:24:38.960 dealership and if you have the I'm gonna
00:24:41.570 say a Shelby gt500 a $80,000 how much
00:24:45.710 does that cost but a brand new Shelby
00:24:47.600 gt500 we really don't feel it yet
00:24:50.210 already already okay how much one else
00:25:02.420 cost 72 nine that's crazy
00:25:05.630 760 horsepower so for 72 73 thousand
00:25:10.220 dollars you can buy a car that is so
00:25:13.220 fast if you if you really can know that
00:25:16.310 there's a difference between the speed
00:25:17.630 of that and then the next car after that
00:25:19.640 the next car that's more powerful you
00:25:21.710 really should be in jail LCD
00:25:26.510 oh it's dope is flaunting cluster yeah
00:25:29.360 well a lot of cars are doing that now
00:25:31.520 because they can get so much more
00:25:33.260 information in front of you instead of
00:25:34.970 just the standard gauges but do there's
00:25:37.280 still something about them standard
00:25:38.900 gauges see that Mustang electric car yes
00:25:42.080 not bad it's not bad at all it's like a
00:25:44.300 fat Mustang right yeah it's interesting
00:25:47.540 right they're using the Mustang name for
00:25:49.340 other [ __ ] now that's controversial that
00:25:52.280 could cause a problem why not just come
00:25:54.260 up with another name that's not a
00:25:55.700 Mustang you know that's not a Mustang
00:25:57.380 that's an SUV yeah what about it makes
00:25:59.240 it a Mustang if it's alright why you'd
00:26:01.070 like that they're talking about doing
00:26:02.750 that with Corvette - the Corvette could
00:26:04.910 branch off and become a brand like
00:26:07.010 Cadillac is you know Cadillac is a brand
00:26:10.070 it's you know it's synonymous with
00:26:12.830 luxury you think of Cadillacs but it's a
00:26:15.740 GM car and if they decide to take the
00:26:19.010 Corvette model and just make it a brand
00:26:21.200 and so have core dope SUVs like fast
00:26:24.470 racy SUVs fast racy four-door sedans
00:26:28.370 whatever sells cars man cuz did you see
00:26:31.430 that Tesla's now valued at as much as GM
00:26:34.190 and Ford together combined yeah whoops
00:26:35.929 guys [ __ ] dummies he's a super cheap
00:26:38.390 yes just back off it's hilarious right
00:26:43.310 yeah so going up today like God makes
00:26:46.310 amazing cars he makes amazing [ __ ]
00:26:49.250 cars we're talking about Elon Musk Tesla
00:26:52.220 is worth more today than what is it
00:26:53.930 what's the stock Yemen for it's like
00:26:55.610 it's over 500 now but like the market
00:26:57.590 value is their combined yeah and
00:26:59.840 everybody was saying it was gonna fall
00:27:00.980 apart I think it's a beautiful car guys
00:27:02.690 but I got to give more time especially

00:27:22.520 a bump on a log
00:27:23.360 yep you do you know there's just so many
00:27:25.970 different charging places I took an uber
00:27:28.820 a couple weeks ago I got into a car that
00:27:31.100 was just amazing that blew me away a
00:27:33.380 [ __ ] Honda Accord Hybrid well they're
00:27:38.750 making everything Accord is that they
00:27:40.880 make some nicer corner now this car even
00:27:42.770 listen you get in the Honda you get
00:27:46.150 Toyota sometimes I'll tell you it as
00:27:48.350 much but uh Mitsubishi what's the other
00:27:50.900 one
00:27:51.320 Hyundai when you close the door there's
00:27:53.720 a lightness in the metal that's where
00:27:56.720 you see the you know there's a light
00:27:58.430 that's like to be close a certain way
00:28:00.230 when I get in here [ __ ] Porsche and I
00:28:02.570 close it that's that makes a certain
00:28:04.430 noise you know it's yes think noise

00:28:08.480 tiny one
00:28:09.230 I got a 1993 964 it's a real light car
00:28:14.210 but the metal in it is so much thicker
00:28:18.790 it this doors like trunk when you close
00:28:22.100 the door
00:28:22.700 chunk like you could feel the weight to
00:28:25.250 it you feel when you tap the fenders to
00:28:26.930 there's no give it's a different
00:28:28.970 structure totally different so I was
00:28:31.280 blown away by the Honda Accord Hybrid

00:28:36.500 jam and it's just a great little car
00:28:38.060 look another couple different options I
00:28:39.980 was in Huntington Beach you're thinking
00:28:42.230 about going away from Subaru and adding

00:32:15.290 missiles that was the black beauty tell
00:32:17.300 my god that's hilarious
00:32:19.130 but I like I always like that's a car
00:32:22.730 you had a [ __ ] car who made that one
00:32:26.570 now that's a restomod Green Hornet now
00:32:31.760 the new one that was the new one with
00:32:34.100 Seth Rogen right yeah I didn't see that
00:32:36.740 one no no the one we dropped that one
00:32:39.560 look at that one
00:32:40.790 people don't understand we're a little
00:32:43.430 too young for it but people don't
00:32:44.930 understand what an impact Bruce Lee had
00:32:46.760 when he was doing the Green Hornet when
00:32:49.040 people saw him do martial arts moves the
00:32:51.380 way he did on screen like people wanted
00:32:54.320 I mean you have to think about how many
00:32:56.270 people would watch a TV show back then
00:32:58.600 like if you had a TV show there's only
00:33:01.010 like three different things to watch
00:33:02.510 right like if you had a TV show you had
00:33:05.360 the entire country watching one of three
00:33:08.240 things and if you had a big show if The
00:33:10.370 Green Hornet was the Green Hornet and on
00:33:12.350 Sunday nights
00:33:13.190 so was it was like stealing yeah
00:33:15.830 everyone home you had
00:33:17.510 you either had lawrence welk on [ __ ]
00:33:20.179 channel 7 on ABC look at he's p8 you
00:33:24.830 didn't see this looks like I dropped and
00:33:26.929 he just traumatized NBC NBC was
00:33:29.570 traumatized only did 6 episode look how
00:33:32.120 bad their [ __ ] fight scenes are these
00:33:35.659 look at these white guys faking punches
00:33:37.940 oh my god it's hilarious to see like old
00:33:43.010 school bad TV like fight acting like
00:33:47.299 well you know the punch didn't hit them
00:33:48.529 in the hair goes flying it's so weird
00:33:52.309 especially because we're not playing any
00:33:54.200 of the volume so we're just watching it
00:33:55.940 so when you're watching with no volume
00:33:57.409 you get to really see how preposterous
00:33:58.880 it is how many how many TV shows that
00:34:01.639 that guys you know that Spanish dude did
00:34:05.179 about a thousand episodes of different
00:34:07.070 TV shows from the late 60s all through
00:34:10.219 the 70s who isn't I don't know what he's
00:34:13.280 the guy that was starring right there
00:34:15.530 right there that guy you know character
00:34:18.500 actors were like [ __ ] so huge back
00:34:20.750 then but then Bruce Lee came on Sunday
00:34:23.899 nights I still remember driving back
00:34:25.969 from Miami with my family I like being
00:34:28.760 pissed because I miss Bruce Lee then
00:34:31.579 they cancelled it you didn't see nothing
00:34:34.010 about Bruce Lee again bro how long was
00:34:37.219 it between that and the big movies it
00:34:39.530 was about a year and a half that come
00:34:42.560 for movies were mainstream Five Fingers
00:34:44.929 a death came out no the yeah
00:34:47.839 Five Fingers at that it was all about
00:34:49.460 the iron palm technique the guy would
00:34:51.980 look at you and this pawn would turn
00:34:54.109 pink and that started with that and then
00:35:01.640 Fist of Fury came huh but I'm not gonna
00:35:04.099 lie to you and tell you I went to see
00:35:05.420 Fist of Fury in the movie theater I
00:35:07.069 don't remember when Chinese connection
00:35:09.710 came out that's what changed the
00:35:11.540 ballgame but see it pisses me off today
00:35:14.780 you know when I see [ __ ] people with
00:35:17.420 twenty years old talking about the
00:35:18.890 impact of Bruce Lee or whatever first
00:35:21.230 off let's get this straight
00:35:22.280 Bruce Lee was a tough guy but he wasn't
00:35:24.859 gonna beat Muhammad Ali that was so
00:35:26.720 silly he wasn't gonna be Bob Marley he
00:35:29.300 was
00:35:29.740 whatever Bruce Lee Bruce Lee meant that
00:35:32.860 the little guy had hope Bruce Lee gave
00:35:35.230 the immigrant hope you know that's what
00:35:37.450 all these guys all we [ __ ] it changed
00:35:40.270 everybody put a little bounce in the
00:35:42.070 step he chose martial arts he changed
00:35:44.619 martial arts but he gave you hope the
00:35:46.480 movie theaters were packed martial arts
00:35:49.300 schools were packed black people were
00:35:51.430 going crazy because nobody sucked it

00:41:35.340 help you it can be it could be
00:41:37.740 beneficial or you could just use it just
00:41:40.410 one or two things right you got to
00:41:42.360 figure out like what's optimal for you
00:41:44.220 when you're on the road for me I always
00:41:47.400 have better sets when I work out you
00:41:48.930 have to work out always you have to work
00:41:51.000 I don't like that weird fog that I feel

00:42:02.610 machine for 20 minutes it points listen
00:42:04.440 to some good music and just say there's
00:42:06.720 no

00:48:20.800 seen a vagina no titties nothing and we
00:48:24.130 used to play basketball and our two dogs
00:48:25.780 were blind
00:48:26.650 she had French poodles
00:48:28.760 and she had flip-flops and she crossed
00:48:30.440 the street and she was so hot she was 38
00:48:33.320 and she had an her husband that was like
00:48:35.150 60 he would just barely be alive like
00:48:37.820 that dude from Texas that was [ __ ] a
00:48:39.500 Howard Marshall
00:48:40.310 and he would watch her cuz he knew he
00:48:42.410 was savage through things like that she
00:48:45.230 had two daughters and the daughters were
00:48:47.360 badass and but one of my goombas dated
00:48:50.000 one of the daughters I never told him I
00:48:52.160 was alive each time I play basketball
00:48:54.250 failure would come on the game would you
00:48:56.450 stop and she turned for us and the Sun
00:48:59.930 would shine through a halt
00:49:01.160 remember all the time in the seventies

00:49:14.360 delicious and finally summer of [ __ ]
00:49:17.960 79 I'm getting all [ __ ] up with some
00:49:21.230 friends of mine I've been drinking
00:49:23.360 [ __ ] nips we started some angel dust

00:49:35.570 it goes into the lemon song and he's
00:49:37.550 talking about squeeze me baby - the
00:49:39.440 juice runs down my leg

00:49:43.070 down my leg my mother was a flower
00:49:45.560 chicks yet flowers everywhere I put on
00:49:48.350 like a shirt I swear to god it had to be
00:49:50.240 about that because she would walk the
00:49:51.440 dog at night but the husband called you
00:49:53.180 15 the dog would sleep that the husband
00:49:57.200 would pass out by 8:00 so she would take
00:49:59.750 the dogs out for the 10 o'clock the last
00:50:02.540 she would pull him down and you know
00:50:04.070 they were kind of blind French poodles
00:50:06.020 and she was still wearing a [ __ ]
00:50:07.970 tighty whities you know the defense

00:50:26.150 that flowers for I was gonna bring her
00:50:29.060 flowers but my plan was to attack it
00:50:31.880 like his jumper in the thing throw it
00:50:34.520 down and get with the flowers is how
00:50:36.080 crazy she was gonna attack her

00:50:40.350 wanted to marry her like that's how
00:50:41.910 [ __ ] about anywhere not an angel dust
00:50:44.280 and I was on edge of this it was what I
00:50:45.930 would tease see crystal call it what you
00:50:47.520 want it's animal tranquilizer
00:50:49.500 no matter how you look at it and I
00:50:52.260 remember that I ran up on her and she
00:50:54.600 turned and she goes Coco what's going on

00:52:36.450 was the man how many times I jerk off to
00:52:38.670 Kelly LeBrock and woman in red one of
00:52:41.250 Gene Wilder calls to her he this is what
00:52:44.310 it is his steps are too short and his

00:52:58.380 ice you know in there those Japanese
00:53:00.600 people work 3,000 years to put Aikido on
00:53:03.690 the map and now you're gonna set the
00:53:05.550 back that poor aikido school and Burbank
00:53:08.580 has moved eight times they keep losing
00:53:10.410 students it down to two students wearing
00:53:12.420 a smock and a [ __ ] sword who's gonna
00:53:14.730 go for Aikido as someone who doesn't
00:53:17.430 really want to fight and you want to you
00:53:19.440 want to be able to passively get someone
00:53:22.290 away from you which is not realistic but
00:53:24.240 the sword part the sword part could come
00:53:26.460 up if [ __ ] hits the fan if we go back
00:53:28.890 and you know if we get knocked into the
00:53:31.170 Stone Age nuclear war with Russia we
00:53:33.840 gonna see a beat now and he's joined
00:53:35.790 again no dodged sticks yeah they moved
00:53:40.410 their bird back and I've thought about
00:53:42.150 when I was a kid I went to Aikido for
00:53:44.340 about two weeks it's probably fun the
00:53:45.810 guy's name was Richard ball he was I
00:53:48.270 supposed to be a big time and gottenberg
00:53:50.070 New Jersey mm-hmm and he taught that
00:53:52.410 deflection stuff but Steven Seagal and
00:53:55.050 above the Lord took it to a different
00:53:56.610 level that out that a harm that throat
00:53:59.130 slam oh yeah he's got the deflection
00:54:02.190 throat slam that's [ __ ] beautiful I
00:54:05.550 had a meeting with a guy in a in a movie
00:54:08.550 there's this like my agent sent me in to
00:54:11.040 meet with this guy they were looking for
00:54:12.870 someone to do like a Steven Seagal type
00:54:15.150 movie they were looking to they were
00:54:17.130 gonna try to create an action star and
00:54:19.500 we actually had like a argument about
00:54:22.620 this movie that move right there but the
00:54:25.920 less poisonous throat I got carried away
00:54:33.740 of the law and the one we [ __ ] up the
00:54:37.950 Jamaicans oh yeah which one was that
00:54:40.200 without swords then sword fighting and
00:54:42.150 hard to kill wasn't that that's the one
00:54:44.550 that pissed me off as well oh you're in
00:54:47.160 a coma for four years into these two
00:54:49.140 days later you throw in a sidekick yeah
00:54:50.760 and he's putting like Jesus Christ
00:54:57.500 Jesus Christ yeah I loved it I'm on time
00:55:01.440 I love to do I loved in to I like the
00:55:04.080 thing about him man is I think in that
00:55:05.790 first movie it was one of the more
00:55:09.570 unique martial arts movies like above
00:55:13.140 the law like it's almost a shame that he
00:55:15.360 made a bunch of movies that weren't as
00:55:17.190 good because if you go back to above the
00:55:19.200 law in terms of like martial arts
00:55:21.030 history and above the law is a
00:55:23.870 legitimate historical movie in terms of
00:55:28.440 martial arts movies because it was the
00:55:30.930 first movie where you got to see a real
00:55:33.390 Aikido practitioner with a hybridized
00:55:36.120 system of martial arts like he was doing
00:55:38.280 our Kido but he was also throwing a lot
00:55:40.590 of punches and knife hand strikes and a
00:55:42.930 lot of strikes it was a showed the
00:55:45.120 bodega feed and above the law just split
00:55:47.790 play this out that's the bet all y'alls
00:55:49.650 this guy look at all the [ __ ]
00:55:52.920 I mean I've made fun of him as much as
00:55:54.960 anybody but listen his Aikido skills
00:55:58.170 were very legit
00:56:00.060 he was very legit whether or not that
00:56:02.160 stuff's real or not that's a subject for
00:56:04.500 debate whether or not it's really
00:56:06.060 effective when you look at other things
00:56:08.160 like wrestling and jiu-jitsu is it the
00:56:10.830 most effective way to grow or judo is
00:56:12.870 the most effective way no it's not but
00:56:15.240 no one knew that back then and he at the
00:56:18.390 time in the 1980s and 90s was a
00:56:22.190 world-class martial artist he just had a
00:56:25.140 style that ultimately didn't really
00:56:27.930 prove to be the best style but so did I
00:56:30.150 I was doing this is this is hard to kill
00:56:33.900 a lot of people were doing kung fu a lot
00:56:35.760 of people were doing things that they
00:56:36.690 thought were legit but they really wants
00:56:39.510 the UFC came around we found out oh this
00:56:41.280 is not the best way to do it
00:56:42.630 this is 87 that's a kid in this scene
00:56:45.410 that was just in a movie with Clint

01:05:37.990 cross-dressing at the very least like
01:05:39.700 pretending to be a girl but it turns out
01:05:41.380 to be a guy the whole time and

01:09:24.729 out at Yankee Stadium over racist song
01:09:27.609 listen to the song she said whose kids
01:09:29.830 I'm [ __ ] fat chick from 19 2013 19 31
01:09:33.310 song yeah
01:09:34.600 that's why [ __ ] were born wait a
01:09:36.430 minute she sang this in 1931 yeah how
01:09:39.700 old is this [ __ ] is he still alive it's
01:09:43.299 like the recording of God Bless America
01:09:44.680 from back then that they used to just
01:09:46.479 play during right she sang that but when
01:09:48.939 did she when she was record in 1937 the
01:09:51.370 way
01:09:51.609 did she sing the national anthem no no
01:09:53.679 it's the god Bless America is what
01:09:55.630 they're talking about here okay but when
01:09:58.300 did she sing god bless america
01:10:00.000 1929 1930 something I don't know back
01:10:02.380 then but she also song sang a song
01:10:05.139 called that's why [ __ ] a boy I was
01:10:07.119 confused I was thinking you were saying
01:10:08.650 that she sang it at listen to the lyrics
01:10:10.690 someone she pick cotton
01:10:12.250 someone had to pick the corn someone had
01:10:14.710 this be a slave if somebody had this
01:10:16.480 thing that's why [ __ ] were born oh
01:10:20.040 that you know I mean all these things
01:10:23.369 the song which has been called a
01:10:25.780 satirical take on racism was a big hit
01:10:28.270 for Smith and also was recorded by a
01:10:30.580 Paul Robeson hmm hmm so she wrote and
01:10:36.969 sang god Bless America so the version
01:10:38.710 that you would hear like God she sang it
01:10:41.980 so that recorded it so the version that
01:10:44.139 you would hear would be back then right
01:10:46.540 so yeah see that's a that's why she gets
01:10:49.690 weird you know there's been a lot of
01:10:51.900 great people over the years that have
01:10:55.480 had some horrible ideas oh so you have
01:10:58.030 to wonder like like if we just cut out
01:11:00.730 the guy I mean how many people different
01:11:03.369 people who have invented incredible
01:11:05.139 things that we use all the time we're
01:11:06.909 also really shitty human beings like you
01:11:10.630 know about that Fritz hopper guy the guy
01:11:12.400 that he created this ability to this
01:11:14.940 method to extract nitrogen from the
01:11:17.949 atmosphere and then use it as fertilizer
01:11:20.409 because the air apparently you think of
01:11:22.810 the air is oxygen it's not most of what
01:11:25.630 you're breathing in most of what our air
01:11:27.610 is is 80s I think it's like 80 something
01:11:30.670 percent nitrogen and so this guy figured
01:11:33.070 out a way how to extract nitrogen from
01:11:34.600 the air and because that population
01:11:36.159 boomed because we had more food because
01:11:38.199 they could they could lay down more more
01:11:41.679 fertilizer so he did something good yeah
01:11:43.540 but he also invented nerve gas he was
01:11:46.750 the first guy to propose and implement a
01:11:50.230 poison gas strategy against against
01:11:54.520 Europe when they were when the UK and
01:11:57.909 when the whatever the the whole group
01:12:00.520 and what was was how World War one or
01:12:02.860 two where they did that I want to say
01:12:04.719 it's too right
01:12:05.480 is it to whatever war it was in they
01:12:11.090 were the first people to get so this guy
01:12:13.040 who had created the harbor method for
01:12:15.320 extracting nitrogen at the same time was
01:12:17.960 wanted for war crimes because he figured
01:12:20.570 out how to gasps gasps the the enemy and
01:12:24.740 he was working for the Nazis and he was
01:12:27.080 a Jew the whole thing is crazy it gets
01:12:29.000 even crazier they eventually started
01:12:30.590 imprisoning Jews and kicked them out of
01:12:31.910 the country and he's still there and so
01:12:34.460 he eventually winds up leaving his tail
01:12:38.060 is [ __ ] crazy but that guy also
01:12:40.070 invented the same gas they used to gas
01:12:41.870 the the gas the Jews and concentration
01:12:45.830 camps he invented it but he invented it
01:12:48.620 with a smell to it
01:12:50.000 so you could detect it and they were
01:12:51.680 gonna use it as like I think it was a
01:12:53.180 pesticide or something like that
01:12:54.500 you talking about a monster yeah I
01:12:55.910 thought I think it's a chemist he's John
01:12:57.650 Lennon he he wrote Benny and the Jets
01:12:59.660 please Maggie Yoko I'm saying no misdeal
01:13:02.300 a monster but he's one of the like that
01:13:04.430 he's seen fifty percent of the nitrogen
01:13:06.320 in our bodies today are from the Harbor
01:13:08.150 method fifty percent so he invented
01:13:10.040 something that literally changed the way
01:13:12.410 people couldn't eat I mean they probably
01:13:15.650 saved billions of lives I mean I don't
01:13:17.810 know I mean I'm just guessing but I
01:13:19.970 would imagine one of the biggest
01:13:21.980 problems that people had back then was
01:13:25.100 when you couldn't grow things places
01:13:26.510 when you didn't have enough food I mean
01:13:28.250 it was a real touch-and-go situation
01:13:29.150 before refrigeration and then before you
01:13:32.570 know large-scale trucking and
01:13:35.020 agriculture everywhere like we have
01:13:36.800 today and how much of the nitrogen that
01:13:38.360 we use came because this guy figured out
01:13:41.060 otherwise they would just use like dead
01:13:43.040 fish and things like that they'd have
01:13:44.570 like compost that's what fertilizer was
01:13:47.090 bones would grind up bones but he's also
01:13:50.600 a monster also you know they figured
01:13:53.710 through his work how to kill people with
01:13:56.720 gas they just gassed entire troops
01:13:59.980 [ __ ] crazy [ __ ] man when no one had
01:14:02.360 never done that before I mean you got to
01:14:04.220 think back then people would I mean
01:14:06.560 think about this the the the war the
01:14:08.840 independence war right the war for
01:14:10.370 independence against England when they
01:14:12.260 would wear the British where those crazy
01:14:14.870 outfits with the white right across
01:14:16.670 their chest they were perfect targets
01:14:19.080 they'd be walking to the forest and
01:14:20.520 these Hillbillies just pick them out
01:14:21.990 because they were walking like they're
01:14:23.430 in some sort of old-timey war like they
01:14:25.710 used to do wars like they had rules for
01:14:27.330 war
01:14:27.810 now there's rules for engagement and
01:14:29.610 then when a general would lose he would
01:14:31.740 hand his sword over to the other men
01:14:33.630 sometimes they wouldn't even take it
01:14:34.980 because they were trying to be polite
01:14:36.510 and they would have these rules like
01:14:38.700 gentlemen rules for killing people and
01:14:41.550 then this guy came out with a method hey
01:14:43.680 how about this have we were just gassy
01:14:46.230 some other [ __ ] just drop gas on them
01:14:48.870 kill everybody just you let them choke
01:14:51.720 to death in their own blood literally
01:14:53.970 your body just vomiting blood it's
01:14:57.090 coming out of your eyeballs everyone
01:14:58.590 around you is dying from the same thing
01:15:00.210 you just hemorrhaging just dying because
01:15:03.660 some genius scientist who also created a
01:15:06.120 method to extract nitrogen out of the
01:15:08.760 air that fed millions of hungry people
01:15:12.230 also figured out a way to do this
01:15:16.490 awesome [ __ ] up it's [ __ ] up
01:15:19.740 you just breathe me out yeah well
01:15:21.720 sometimes great people have done
01:15:25.770 horrible horrible things but that guy
01:15:28.770 invented something that we all use it's
01:15:30.870 a it's a tricky thing being a person you
01:15:33.540 know people are slippery
01:15:34.710 there's a lot of good and bad about us
01:15:37.460 it depends how you use it yes it depends
01:15:41.520 how you use it well that's why being a
01:15:43.230 comic is like one of the most fulfilling
01:15:45.570 things of all time because people get
01:15:48.330 something out of it like if they go to
01:15:50.610 see you like the reason why you're
01:15:52.740 willing to eat dick it's because you
01:15:54.060 want to develop these bits and have them
01:15:56.100 crush get them to that point or when
01:15:58.230 people come to see and they pay money to
01:15:59.730 see you boom you lay them on them and
01:16:01.650 like that feeling that you can do that
01:16:04.650 you can give to something when you see
01:16:05.880 someone just laughing so hard there's
01:16:08.250 one of the greatest feelings a person
01:16:11.160 can ever experience and not a lot of
01:16:13.500 people get to experience and you imagine
01:16:15.780 how important laughs there is in your
01:16:17.940 life so have for a certain point like
01:16:20.910 it's urine it's like you know you need
01:16:24.570 sleep yeah you need food
01:16:27.440 and if you really have a laughter but
01:16:30.290 you also have to learn how to laugh at
01:16:32.540 yourself yes
01:16:33.920 and once you conquer that your life
01:16:36.739 changes completely
01:16:38.210 yeah that's 50% you know you know the
01:16:40.730 number one killer is stress that's
01:16:43.130 number one you think I could kill you
01:16:44.630 yeah is you being stressed out but humor
01:16:47.480 I mean I love getting high at night
01:16:50.989 doing edibles and finding stupid videos
01:16:54.260 this is watching that whole stand-up
01:16:56.210 real yeah I'm just laughing my [ __ ]
01:16:58.850 ass off I love it I love it I'm enjoying
01:17:02.330 it more every day when you have kids you
01:17:04.370 really laugh at this [ __ ] they talk
01:17:07.130 about you know did I laugh at kids
01:17:08.930 movies I watched Dora the Explorer the
01:17:12.020 the live-action one one the new one we

01:17:17.600 legit laughs in that movie I got bad
01:17:19.550 movie people the last couple of years
01:17:24.290 I've gone to see maybe seven or eight
01:17:27.140 mainstream films by probably seeing 20
01:17:30.410 kid films yeah and I leave those films
01:17:33.469 blown away so you know what's [ __ ]
01:17:35.270 great Jumanji I had a new one it's as

01:17:48.710 movies I go watch I'm like what the [ __ ]
01:17:51.020 was fast
01:17:51.620 Jumanji hits a perfect balance between
01:17:54.910 it's like it's a family movie but you
01:17:59.030 don't treat you like you're a [ __ ]
01:18:00.920 it's fun and it's it's you know they're
01:18:03.440 trapped in a video game so it doesn't
01:18:04.940 have to make sense it can be crazy and
01:18:07.040 so it is crazy but it's a [ __ ] great

01:18:14.840 good you laugh your ass off good and
01:18:17.350 they ride the edge perfectly of it being
01:18:21.290 enjoyable for old people but hilarious
01:18:23.300 for kids kids think Jumanji hilarious so
01:18:26.270 you could sit there why you know I took

01:29:05.349 stopped I go this is what I'm getting
01:29:06.730 for my money now so when I buy a [ __ ]
01:29:09.489 CD from a record label I open it up and
01:29:12.010 it's a CD would have didn't even don't

01:29:26.380 and Warner Brothers the other guys like
01:29:28.000 on fire yeah they put time in so I think
01:29:31.810 that and everybody kept saying sound
01:29:34.530 well the sound CD didn't listen just to
01:29:39.070 put that [ __ ] needle on
01:29:40.940 again I wonder how many [ __ ]
01:29:43.670 turntables are sold in America last year
01:29:46.220 for the album to come back and I have
01:29:49.040 one in my office and I go to I go to two
01:29:52.280 different places he's my son headphones
01:29:54.380 would you listen just the speakers when
01:29:56.240 I listen in the office I put them on
01:29:58.670 with the speakers at the office it's
01:30:02.420 when I listen to it at home I got the
01:30:05.120 headphones it's um it's a different
01:30:09.230 experience right you're like you're
01:30:10.880 sitting down like you're watching a show
01:30:12.560 almost to think about music when I'm
01:30:15.770 streaming it as I'm almost always doing
01:30:18.080 something I'm very rarely just listening
01:30:21.440 to music I'm always listening to music
01:30:23.540 while I'm driving or listen to music
01:30:25.160 while I'm working out or wild flying I
01:30:27.650 don't hardly ever just listen to music
01:30:30.080 sit down but when you have an album when
01:30:32.240 you have a record player I think that
01:30:34.210 the it would definitely make you more
01:30:37.220 inclined to treat it like an event you
01:30:39.680 know just have a cup of coffee smoke a
01:30:43.850 joint sit on the couch just listen to it
01:30:47.360 just listen to it listen to some bars
01:30:49.550 you know listen I get anxiety about 20
01:30:53.030 to 8:00 every night 22 8:20 date right
01:30:56.330 around that same time yeah because for
01:30:59.110 years that's when I was thinking about
01:31:01.280 when I was on the score coke so till
01:31:04.550 this day that's the PTSD I got that at
01:31:07.280 7:30 I start giving Zionists or getting

01:31:16.640 to maybe lower jujitsu it but sounds

01:31:57.710 gotta go after that I'm just it's a
01:32:00.200 little demotion when I was training in

01:37:33.969 found it wasn't there
01:37:35.949 and it could either been Boston in New
01:37:37.870 Jersey I'm not putting the blame on
01:37:39.640 those right right I remember so he too
01:37:42.550 found out her whereabouts and he found
01:37:44.530 that he called like every restaurant on
01:37:47.170 that area to see who would have that
01:37:48.760 specific type of clam hmm and he [ __ ]
01:37:52.150 caught the killer because he paid for
01:37:54.010 when his credit card whoa
01:37:58.050 so he went and found that the specific
01:38:01.390 clam what restaurant in that area sold
01:38:03.760 it and that's what she had in her
01:38:05.920 stomach
01:38:06.580 they weren't cherry stones or the other
01:38:08.890 ones there were the other ones there was
01:38:10.989 the most horrific story from that one
01:38:13.080 one episode where they had this guy
01:38:15.820 believe he was a doctor and he was
01:38:17.710 infatuated with this woman who's his
01:38:19.330 patient and when she died he I think he
01:38:22.420 had married her one time down or
01:38:24.070 something like that he it's some kind of
01:38:26.050 relationship with her he'd dug up her
01:38:27.520 body and kept it in his house and it put
01:38:31.239 a tube where her vagina is so he could
01:38:33.790 still have sex with her and he was
01:38:35.710 buying cases and cases of perfume and I
01:38:38.890 think that's what tip people off this
01:38:41.380 guy was buying cases of perfume because
01:38:43.719 she was rotting in his bed so he would
01:38:46.929 cover her with perfume showy autopsy
01:38:52.239 autop HBO autopsy yeah
01:38:55.179 [ __ ] great show great show and they
01:38:57.070 would come on like at 1:00 so he studies
01:38:59.320 Jeffrey Epstein and he finds out that
01:39:01.660 there's breaks in jeffrey Epstein's neck
01:39:04.330 that is he's never seen ever in a
01:39:08.560 hanging
01:39:09.219 they only seen from strangulation only
01:39:11.830 see four murders you know they said that
01:39:14.170 he hung himself
01:39:15.100 yeah am i [ __ ] am I missing this
01:39:18.540 they're trying to find it's a four foot
01:39:21.489 wall yeah he threw himself against the
01:39:23.290 wall mm-hmm
01:39:24.390 really all right the the neck had blood
01:39:27.730 but the [ __ ] thing then that blood on
01:39:30.040 it it's such a horrible [ __ ] thing
01:39:32.560 yeah the cops the overtime they had been
01:39:35.290 working the tapes got shut off how about
01:39:37.780 the fact that they deleted the first
01:39:39.070 tapes oh so he went he had an original
01:39:41.650 attempt on his life and then they had a
01:39:44.469 second one and they they can't find the
01:39:46.929 tapes for the second one and then they
01:39:48.670 activated
01:39:49.540 leading the tapes in the first one I
01:39:50.980 mean this it's not 1930
01:39:53.890 it's 2020 if they can get away with that
01:39:56.950 in 2020 I mean I don't know how far
01:40:00.070 anyone's gonna track this down how far
01:40:03.490 like how many they are well the reason
01:40:05.950 why he got arrested in the first place
01:40:07.360 is because people did talk about it and
01:40:10.150 they did get motivated to do something
01:40:11.740 because they're like how does a guy get
01:40:13.270 arrested for having sex with underage
01:40:15.550 kids and then only get like 13 months
01:40:19.150 and then during that 13 months he had a
01:40:20.920 baby but basically he was like he just
01:40:23.530 had a return at night right he didn't he
01:40:26.890 he had the ability to travel and go
01:40:28.690 wherever he wanted at 16 hours like work
01:40:30.550 release for the day could go to his
01:40:31.990 office we do what he did literally all
01:40:34.210 you do is sleep there every night so was
01:40:36.160 it an inconvenience an inconvenience for
01:40:39.040 him and everybody's like what and then
01:40:41.980 when you start thinking about the
01:40:43.150 stories and the jet in the island and
01:40:45.670 all the craziness like this is not a
01:40:47.920 movie this is real this is not a movie
01:40:50.500 there was an island where an
01:40:52.950 intelligence agent would take scientists
01:40:58.030 and heads of state and they would bang
01:41:00.100 chicks that intelligence thing is I'll
01:41:04.720 just say strong rumor because it's only
01:41:06.760 been mentioned by a few people and like
01:41:08.890 that ABC report didn't mention it at all
01:41:10.960 maybe they left it out I don't think
01:41:12.640 they can prove it so when someone says
01:41:14.620 something and then that I mean is there
01:41:16.420 a recording of that guy saying who
01:41:17.950 remember the guy that said that he was
01:41:19.360 told that it wasn't that Epstein was
01:41:20.800 intelligence news above his pay grade
01:41:22.060 Acosta yes his name again
01:41:25.480 yeah I don't know though Alexander cut
01:41:28.690 to Jim we got fired though or he had to
01:41:31.360 resign after they went and looked into
01:41:33.640 this and you got mmm RIA rested I have
01:41:36.550 not seen bombshell
01:41:37.810 have you seen bombshell that's the new
01:41:40.680 shop please they're wrong she plays
01:41:44.020 megyn kelly right Roger Ailes
01:41:46.990 yeah and it's all about the the sexual
01:41:51.100 harassment and I was watching the ladies
01:41:53.320 watched it together the actual women
01:41:56.500 that were that lived it and then they
01:41:58.800 afterwards they talked about it they
01:42:01.480 talked about what was real and what was
01:42:02.710 not
01:42:02.900 real but one thing that was really laid
01:42:05.390 them stand in front of him and twirl
01:42:07.460 around so they could see their ass so he
01:42:10.100 could see their house and like so
01:42:12.290 imagine you're a woman you you get this
01:42:14.330 job you're gonna be an anchor like I'm
01:42:16.130 really excited to work for you mr. Ailes
01:42:17.540 thank you all right this one I want you
01:42:19.550 do I want to see your ass I want you to
01:42:22.370 spin around and so he I mean that's a
01:42:29.239 weird is that a real picture Photoshop
01:42:32.659 for press release doesn't look fake
01:42:34.790 doesn't look a fake picture they
01:42:36.770 probably weren't all next to each other
01:42:38.320 huh what is he making Kelly complain
01:42:42.980 about she was sexually harassed oh yeah
01:42:44.960 everybody was they're all box yeah yeah
01:42:47.750 yeah apparently this guy Roger that's
01:42:50.179 his name roger ailes right what they're
01:42:52.400 saying is that you know he would say I
01:42:54.260 want to see you naked I want to see you
01:42:55.699 in lingerie I want to see naked pictures
01:42:58.130 of you it's just a dirty old fat dude
01:43:00.620 who just harassed the [ __ ] out of all
01:43:04.580 the women that worked there and that was
01:43:06.320 how they did it is that in the movie
01:43:08.810 yeah that's in the movie
01:43:10.310 yeah that's John Lithgow right they put
01:43:12.320 him in a fat suit right they didn't make
01:43:13.730 him get that fat I don't think so that's
01:43:15.230 a lot of weight yeah that's some heart
01:43:17.090 attack [ __ ] he's a fairly healthy guy
01:43:19.510 but uh that guy's dead right didn't he
01:43:23.540 die I think Roger L died I'm pretty sure
01:43:28.690 look at him go back to those pictures go
01:43:33.230 back to images I mean look at that one
01:43:36.949 the one in the middle
01:43:38.870 look at the one in the middle up top
01:43:40.310 with his the red tie out yeah right
01:43:41.690 there look at that I mean if he was
01:43:44.510 alone with her what the [ __ ] do you
01:43:47.000 imagine you would say what kind of
01:43:48.260 creepy [ __ ] do you imagine that dude
01:43:49.489 would say women always think like a guy
01:43:53.150 like that that looks disgusting that you
01:43:54.830 would never have to look I would never
01:43:56.600 have sex with him he knows that the guy
01:44:00.080 that's that rich and that powerful like
01:44:04.790 n looks like that he doesn't even
01:44:06.830 probably know that he doesn't have any
01:44:08.330 game I think he probably thinks that he
01:44:09.890 has game he probably thinks this is a
01:44:11.960 part of why he became rich and famous in
01:44:13.790 the first place these powerful men
01:44:16.070 before
01:44:16.700 all this stuff went down these guys that
01:44:19.220 ran these gigantic companies and that's
01:44:21.410 just what they did so they all did and
01:44:24.560 they got away with it
01:44:25.310 everybody knew right I mean how many
01:44:27.470 companies are like here's the big
01:44:28.970 question how long has this been going on
01:44:31.160 how long have men and women even been
01:44:33.050 working together like that doesn't
01:44:34.730 Jordan Pearson talk about this that
01:44:36.530 hasn't really been that long like but
01:44:41.180 you know in the 1800's men and women
01:44:43.070 didn't work together in offices like
01:44:44.420 this I didn't watch Mad Men but in that
01:44:45.830 what that whole show is kind of about I
01:44:47.240 think I didn't want to either
01:44:48.880 secretaries wives and the husbands and
01:44:52.010 yeah it's real recent for people for men
01:44:55.490 and women to be alongside each other all
01:44:57.530 day that you don't even know each other
01:44:59.270 and you're in an office together
01:45:00.560 throughout all of human history when
01:45:02.780 people got together and work together
01:45:04.100 there were a tribe they were a community
01:45:06.170 wasn't strange random guys that just got
01:45:08.150 hired by [ __ ] HR to come down sit
01:45:11.480 next to you in your office and ask you
01:45:13.520 questions how you conduct yourself and
01:45:15.560 like I know everybody in those days work
01:45:19.580 with people they knew right like if you
01:45:21.710 were in a blacksmith's office like a
01:45:24.100 blacksmith's workshop everybody [ __ ]
01:45:26.690 knew everybody they work together
01:45:29.690 one of my nieces just had a go and she
01:45:35.150 got summoned to talk to somebody yes you
01:45:39.530 know where she went
01:45:40.490 she's going to medical school now but
01:45:43.370 where she's got a regular you know
01:45:45.650 pedigree degree couple weeks ago she had
01:45:49.370 a go she got a [ __ ] letter in the
01:45:51.110 mail and they asked her about this
01:45:53.600 teacher on what she thought she had a
01:45:56.180 spill her guts and they haven't gone
01:45:58.250 [ __ ] at this teacher fired
01:46:00.260 you know it wasn't doing anything sexual
01:46:02.840 was what he was saying same creepy
01:46:05.180 searching him oh he was 60 something you
01:46:08.810 know and it's probably doing his whole
01:46:10.370 life how to confront them and you know
01:46:13.150 well that's you have to think about
01:46:14.870 priests right they've get they're still
01:46:17.750 doing it right they still they still
01:46:19.430 keep getting caught but they've been
01:46:21.230 doing that their whole life and the
01:46:23.150 people before them did it to them and
01:46:24.830 there's generation after generation
01:46:26.270 after generation of child molester
01:46:28.850 priests it's
01:46:29.940 one of the craziest things that
01:46:32.250 Catholics just accept that people are
01:46:35.130 nothing because most Catholics are not
01:46:37.080 pedophiles most Catholics are good
01:46:39.180 people that want a bunch of great you
01:46:41.790 know great people to live together with
01:46:43.950 certain rules and they think if you do
01:46:45.300 abide by these rules then you're doing
01:46:46.950 the work of God but the people at the
01:46:50.100 top there's a certain percentage of them
01:46:52.290 I don't know what the number is that are
01:46:53.880 definitely pedophiles and it's a high
01:46:55.980 number in comparison to every other job
01:46:58.170 if 25% of dentists were pedophiles we
01:47:03.480 would all have rotten teeth you know I'm
01:47:05.310 saying
01:47:05.760 I mean think think about all the
01:47:07.560 different professions lawyers or 25% of
01:47:09.810 lawyers were pedophiles we like their
01:47:11.580 buildings on fire the [ __ ] are you
01:47:13.410 talking about but for some reason I
01:47:15.780 don't know what the percentage is I
01:47:16.920 don't think it's 25% of priests we think
01:47:19.140 it is here's the [ __ ] thing with the
01:47:20.700 priests thing that kills me the priest
01:47:24.330 thing works pretty much it was a no-no I
01:47:29.100 mean we're talking about the 60s and 70s
01:47:31.380 I did a Google search on the grammar
01:47:35.580 school I want to just a look just to
01:47:38.610 look at what the sacred art school for
01:47:40.290 boys and one there one there one night I
01:47:43.500 was high and I was just one on a Google
01:47:45.360 search and went out of foxhole and one
01:47:47.850 of the couple reddit pages of people
01:47:50.400 saying different things and you know
01:47:52.740 what I swear to god there was nothing
01:47:55.080 about Sacred Heart School for Boys and
01:47:57.120 that you couldn't find them
01:47:58.500 but I looked up a different church that
01:48:01.050 was close to my house and it was 200
01:48:04.650 cases well nobody gets prosecuted and
01:48:08.760 they move you to another Archdiocese and
01:48:11.340 you start your little charade again and
01:48:13.590 then when you start like say you [ __ ] up
01:48:16.710 for [ __ ] different states but let's
01:48:19.710 say you go from Jersey to Minneapolis to
01:48:22.530 San Diego then to Louisiana then they
01:48:25.200 ship you overseas
01:48:26.930 once too many letters start to come in
01:48:29.750 about this situation then they ship your
01:48:32.340 overseas and they'll put you at the
01:48:34.620 [ __ ] Vatican well that's what's got

01:51:13.310 you got one of these blunt yeah I'll go
01:51:16.550 grab one hold on sorry about that for
01:51:19.370 children oh no I've experienced it
01:51:21.320 before no I've had a I had a one of
01:51:23.150 those whey protein I can't even I showed
01:51:32.300 you I'm sorry I was looking for a
01:51:35.000 percentage number I just trying to find
01:51:36.560 out the number of priests versus
01:51:38.180 accusations but Los Angeles it seems
01:51:40.880 like 10% of the priests maybe about 600
01:51:44.870 priests and I said at least 70 of them
01:51:46.910 or so I've been accused oh god damn it
01:51:49.910 that might be high I might be low I
01:51:51.800 don't know that's a lot if that's the
01:51:53.780 nationwide thing
01:51:54.890 it matches that's the same it's mirrored
01:51:56.420 or even worse well now the three billion
01:51:58.550 to them have you seen it running an ad
01:52:00.170 have you been molested by a Boy Scout or
01:52:02.930 a [ __ ] priest call this number it's
01:52:05.270 never too late
01:52:06.080 blah blah blah blah blah blah you know
01:52:09.500 now you got they paid out three billion
01:52:11.740 mm-hmm five hundred plus just in Los
01:52:14.210 Angeles oh my god ten years ago that was
01:52:18.500 ten years ago so they might it's just
01:52:20.360 crazy that no one ever says hey maybe
01:52:23.240 this isn't really what God wants maybe
01:52:26.620 you know I'm saying I mean the people
01:52:29.510 that are in the church the people that
01:52:31.280 are believers the people that love to
01:52:33.830 dress up nice and go and behave kind and
01:52:37.130 and and see all the people in the
01:52:38.720 community at the church there's a good
01:52:40.610 feeling that people get from going to
01:52:42.110 church but the fact that it's connected
01:52:44.600 to that is it's it's so insane that it's
01:52:49.700 still there
01:52:50.540 it's so insane that it hasn't been
01:52:52.280 rooted out that this is still a giant
01:52:54.920 problem and relatively few people are
01:52:59.000 going to jail like relatively few like
01:53:01.880 you know who they wanted but they wanted
01:53:04.220 that a Ratzinger that Pope Ratzinger
01:53:07.659 it's one of the reasons why he had to
01:53:08.619 step down and one of the reasons why he
01:53:10.179 stays in the Vatican I was reading some
01:53:12.039 article about them bringing up charges
01:53:14.320 crimes against humanity against him that
01:53:16.949 other countries wanted to do that
01:53:18.969 because this guy used to ship kids or he
01:53:21.729 used to ship priests to places where
01:53:23.919 they wouldn't get in trouble like yeah
01:53:25.360 this one guy was accused of molesting
01:53:26.919 boys and so he shipped him to this place
01:53:29.650 where he worked with dead deaf kids and
01:53:32.409 he molested over a hundred deaf kids
01:53:35.459 it's like what did you do like you
01:53:39.550 shipped a child molester to a bunch of
01:53:42.219 people that wouldn't be able to talk
01:53:43.239 about it well like she'd be able to get
01:53:45.880 away with it easier there if they settle
01:53:48.249 the case that means it doesn't get
01:53:49.599 prosecuted right so that's why they
01:53:51.039 won't go to jail is that why they
01:53:52.510 haven't gone to jail I don't understand
01:53:54.820 it these reports on why aren't they
01:53:57.280 going to jail and I like if you settle a
01:53:58.989 case you don't even call it like they
01:54:00.939 don't keep prosecuting I just I guess if
01:54:03.039 you make us like the person decides to
01:54:05.050 drop charges there was a guy Boston they
01:54:08.530 were gonna [ __ ] give a hundred
01:54:10.659 thousand to the jail there was some time
01:54:14.260 Boston I read about you using another
01:54:16.959 jail now I keep it simple I'm still a
01:54:20.439 Catholic I just don't go to church I
01:54:22.059 don't want to deal with none of those
01:54:22.989 people I don't want to deal with another
01:54:24.369 yeah and any religious level I don't
01:54:26.320 want to deal with them the problem is
01:54:28.150 whenever people get into a position
01:54:29.559 where everybody for the most part is
01:54:32.829 like humble around them and scared of
01:54:36.280 them and they have power like I remember
01:54:38.709 when my grandmother died we went to a
01:54:40.719 funeral and the guy couldn't remember
01:54:43.239 her name my grandmother's name was
01:54:45.249 Josephine he kept calling her Geraldine
01:54:47.530 and the priest who was delivering the
01:54:50.169 service we had to interrupt him say it's
01:54:52.539 Josephine and he was like annoyed that
01:54:55.179 they interrupt him was like yes
01:54:57.249 Josephine like he he changed the net
01:55:00.639 like he didn't even know her name
01:55:02.499 and when he's there to deliver this
01:55:07.419 God's message for the last you know last
01:55:10.630 time the family's gonna view the body he
01:55:14.530 there's no her name and when he was
01:55:16.119 corrected he was angry at us
01:55:18.760 like he had these Gin Blossoms all over
01:55:21.710 his face he's just some weird old guy
01:55:25.160 who got tricked and did this very
01:55:29.270 strange life and now it's at its end and
01:55:31.880 he's been living with robes on
01:55:33.880 supposedly being celibate his whole
01:55:35.750 [ __ ] life while people kiss his ass
01:55:37.430 and pretend to be something special
01:55:38.720 because he talks about the word of God
01:55:40.100 but you could just see in that one
01:55:41.720 moment where he wasn't even embarrassed
01:55:44.000 that he said the wrong name he was upset
01:55:47.540 that people were correcting him because
01:55:50.150 you don't correct priests so he's used
01:55:51.980 to that so there's no one checking him
01:55:53.510 there's no one checking them at all
01:55:55.220 everyone who goes there is in this state
01:55:57.710 of worship and they're the ones who
01:56:00.890 deliver the Word of God
01:56:02.630 dressed like wizards like they're the
01:56:05.330 only people in society that are allowed
01:56:07.250 to dress like wizards in modern American
01:56:10.610 society they dress like [ __ ] wizards
01:56:13.460 and we're like yeah that's how father
01:56:15.530 dresses father dresses like a wizard
01:56:17.510 like do you know people are gonna look
01:56:20.060 back at that and go why didn't they
01:56:21.380 think the outfits were weird why didn't
01:56:23.840 they think it was silly that this
01:56:25.460 pedophile dresses up like a wizard and
01:56:27.350 you're not supposed to say anything to
01:56:28.880 him what is that like what is what is
01:56:31.820 with the outfits the fact that all that
01:56:33.470 shit's still around like there's nowhere
01:56:36.410 in the Bible that says priests have to
01:56:38.240 dress like that no where there's no
01:56:41.630 where the whole thing is so bizarre it's
01:56:45.080 it's you're wearing stuff that made you
01:56:48.950 look like you were very special to
01:56:51.500 really poor people 500 years ago that's
01:56:55.670 what you're wearing you wearing stuff
01:56:57.650 that would impress people that didn't
01:56:59.570 know any better that probably couldn't
01:57:00.740 read and so before Martin Luther
01:57:02.810 translated these the the scriptures so
01:57:07.550 that people could read it like a
01:57:08.600 phonetic language before that people had
01:57:10.910 no idea what the priests were reading
01:57:13.010 they just relied on the priests they
01:57:15.140 relied on the priests to tell them what
01:57:17.870 the Word of God was but now something
01:57:19.400 they could read it for themselves and
01:57:20.390 Martin Luther was saying he should
01:57:22.070 probably interpret it yourself too and
01:57:23.510 they were like oh my god so I said where
01:57:26.210 are they view old enough to go to church
01:57:27.500 when it was still in Latin oh they would
01:57:30.080 say something
01:57:31.689 only be in latin until like 70s or 60 or
01:57:34.479 something really yeah I remember they
01:57:36.639 would say some things in Latin cuz I
01:57:38.320 remember I'd be five years old going
01:57:40.809 what in the [ __ ] are these peoples what
01:57:42.369 type of kid were you between the age of
01:57:43.959 five and ten were you aggressive were
01:57:46.419 you quiet
01:57:47.110 no I did much more introverted okay from
01:57:50.349 the ages of five and ten I went to the
01:57:52.209 white changes until I got hitting there
01:57:53.739 with a lunch box but I believed I really
01:57:57.969 did believe Joe I really did believe I
01:58:00.429 believe in God I believe that my father
01:58:02.169 was in heaven I believe that I polish it
01:58:06.039 yeah then I got introduced to Catholic
01:58:08.229 school and that just [ __ ] me I'm
01:58:09.849 completely because I believed but I
01:58:12.729 didn't believe on the tail end of it
01:58:14.829 it was supposed to be loving risë is non
01:58:17.229 smacking me why is this nun hitting he
01:58:20.289 would have [ __ ] rulings I am and then
01:58:23.320 I saw the anger in their heart and it
01:58:25.449 turned me off completely like I didn't
01:58:27.340 like it today I'm still a Catholic in
01:58:29.619 some boards yeah when my body goes I'd
01:58:32.679 like to go to a [ __ ] Church you know
01:58:34.599 right but I don't hold it I remember
01:58:38.429 selling cars and Boulder but a guy came
01:58:41.979 in and we started talking and he was 50
01:58:45.719 wasn't a good-looking guy look like that
01:58:47.979 [ __ ] guy am I just a year old chick
01:58:50.139 with him and obviously have to take him
01:58:54.519 on a demo right I figured out that he
01:58:56.169 could [ __ ] her and [ __ ]
01:58:58.320 no I realized that he was [ __ ] her
01:59:01.479 she was like his receptionist or
01:59:03.039 something okay but after when we got
01:59:04.869 back I also realized he was my
01:59:06.400 father-in-law friend oh so I asked my
01:59:09.939 father bother me he's and he's on the
01:59:11.860 board of the church rule is he's a great
01:59:13.479 man you know and I still remember him
01:59:16.239 this was Sacred Heart Church in Boulder
01:59:18.880 Colorado in fact that's the same church
01:59:20.800 the head of the football team went to
01:59:23.079 bill McCarthy and all that should I'd
01:59:24.550 see his [ __ ] family there and and it
01:59:27.309 all sit in the fund this [ __ ] scumbag
01:59:29.489 would sit in the second pew with his fat
01:59:32.409 [ __ ] ugly wife you know she had
01:59:35.169 ugliest [ __ ] wife in
01:59:36.719 [ __ ] Church they would hit her with
01:59:38.670 the net with that money that they would
01:59:40.800 just hit her with it like [ __ ] you just
01:59:42.929 ugly but the point was that I never
01:59:46.889 respected it that you cheated on your
01:59:48.719 wife but nothing in here right there
01:59:50.420 playing the [ __ ] I'm a good guy
01:59:52.860 that's a classic story you know the
01:59:54.420 classic stories the big one is the
01:59:56.579 anti-gay pastor that turns out to be gay

02:00:45.749 of get away with it for a long time but

02:04:15.170 about that like why didn't people
02:04:17.590 approach Brian I knew today looking back
02:04:21.199 I still remember three guys and my high
02:04:23.059 school teacher that would come on as a
02:04:26.150 basketball guru and I found that and I
02:04:29.510 always thought a little weird about him
02:04:31.460 I married you know and then years ago
02:04:34.789 somebody said yeah he was sucking [ __ ] I
02:04:39.460 had a guy slow playing me at a lake
02:04:42.190 there was a guy that used to run around
02:04:44.809 the lake and talk to us with more
02:04:46.130 efficient but probably like 13 me and my
02:04:49.280 friend Josh in particular we'd go this
02:04:50.900 one lake it was in our town and we'd
02:04:55.039 fish there all the time and this dude
02:04:56.809 would come by all the time and visit he
02:04:58.400 was always friendly started off real
02:05:00.320 normal what do you guys up to catches a
02:05:02.239 fish like southern accent seems I got an
02:05:05.179 old gentleman and then a couple of times
02:05:08.750 he came when it was just me
02:05:10.730 and then he just sat down next to me and
02:05:14.119 talked to me and I was naive I was 13 I
02:05:16.520 just thought he was a real nice guy
02:05:18.020 like almost like a older brother type
02:05:20.030 figure it's gonna give you a good advice
02:05:22.070 he talked about cool [ __ ] he was a
02:05:24.260 teacher he got kicked out of his
02:05:27.079 position for some unfair reason he
02:05:30.289 wouldn't really be specific about it but
02:05:31.880 he said you know they didn't like the
02:05:33.170 way he taught and so anyway this dude
02:05:36.230 just becomes my friend like nice and
02:05:38.030 slow nice and slow brings me lunch I
02:05:41.449 even went to his house once and then one
02:05:44.989 day I am fishing and he's drunk and he
02:05:50.329 tells me he loves me and I said I think
02:05:53.809 I said something I really like you too
02:05:55.699 he goes you know there there can't be
02:05:58.190 love without sex
02:06:02.150 and I remember thinking what whoa
02:06:07.070 like what did he just what happened
02:06:10.190 and then I might remember thinking what
02:06:12.110 a dummy I am
02:06:13.670 I thought this guy just liked me he was
02:06:16.610 I was his buddy
02:06:17.810 that he's gonna teach me things he just
02:06:19.190 likes teaching people it's just really
02:06:20.659 smart but I had my hand on a knife I had
02:06:23.510 a Swiss Army knife from them little red
02:06:25.310 plastic ones you know the ones with the
02:06:27.140 camel yeah they have all the kind of
02:06:28.670 [ __ ] and all I was thinking is I put it
02:06:31.159 in my hand in my pocket like I held on
02:06:33.949 to it and I remember thinking god damn
02:06:35.570 it I hope I don't have to [ __ ] try to
02:06:36.860 use this because I was thinking it's
02:06:38.270 like he was a big guy you know I was 13
02:06:41.210 I don't know what I weighed 120 pounds
02:06:42.980 or something I'm like [ __ ] this guy
02:06:45.590 might beat the [ __ ] out of me and raped
02:06:47.210 me here in the woods like he was bigger
02:06:49.100 than me and he was always jogging you
02:06:50.600 know it wasn't in bad shape
02:06:52.600 and he I told him get the [ __ ] away from
02:06:57.260 me and he told me to not be upset and
02:06:59.929 then I left I got away he didn't chase
02:07:03.590 me I you know he didn't want to be
02:07:06.739 violent he wanted to trick me into a
02:07:08.390 [ __ ] um he wanted II didn't want to
02:07:10.340 rape me he wanted to trick me into
02:07:12.080 [ __ ] him I got real lucky that that
02:07:14.690 was the case but then years later I got
02:07:17.570 a letter from I'm at my house that was
02:07:20.420 creepy because it showed up in the
02:07:22.310 mailbox like he had figured out where I
02:07:23.780 moved to and sent me a letter oh whoa
02:07:28.280 and it was like real like friendly and
02:07:31.400 professional like a real professor like
02:07:34.310 a scholar I don't even remember if you
02:07:36.590 ever apologized but it was real weird it
02:07:41.060 was like whoa I dodged that bullet
02:07:43.239 how many guys that are like that but
02:07:45.980 aren't nice they just want to get you
02:07:48.260 clothes and then rape you that's much
02:07:49.969 more likely probably that is some
02:07:53.540 horrific [ __ ] man the Puerto Rican
02:07:56.989 Nelson I went to his house that's a name
02:07:59.600 that's what we called him he was born
02:08:01.460 Rican and his name is Nelson they
02:08:03.830 believe I'm giving that terrorist say he
02:08:05.480 lived next to the old teen house but in
02:08:07.040 the back
02:08:09.199 and I think he raped guys with a black
02:08:11.810 dude like there was a black friend of
02:08:13.969 his that would come over there and then
02:08:15.230 they give you beer uh-huh and all that
02:08:17.870 [ __ ] so he took you in as you like [ __ ]
02:08:23.140 type the kid like you always think you
02:08:26.090 want to see some good [ __ ]
02:08:27.410 and then that's how it started then
02:08:30.320 they'll bring you over there you go in
02:08:32.300 and he'd start with the porn first whoo
02:08:34.750 yeah bring your buddies any time you
02:08:37.460 want
02:08:37.850 then it was a porn and they would get a
02:08:40.160 Snickle bags of weed he started with
02:08:42.710 I'll get you weed and then he introduced
02:08:46.370 our black friend tool and I said this
02:08:48.890 black friend just looked too [ __ ]
02:08:50.690 [ __ ] like his afro was cut weird he
02:08:53.989 had weird hair and I remember him
02:08:56.890 distinctively speaking about the Rock of
02:08:59.210 Gibraltar I had just come back from
02:09:02.060 Africa movie young kid it's like wow and
02:09:05.170 then once he showed us the porn it came
02:09:10.790 out like a week later somebody said bro
02:09:13.219 that dude is no good ask what's his name
02:09:16.940 he went over that he had man he asked
02:09:18.440 her fingers suck his dick so were like
02:09:21.469 what are we doing that we call the cops
02:09:23.330 or do we tell carmine we're like no
02:09:25.880 let's just play the guy cuz he was
02:09:27.320 selling us weed he was like a bartender
02:09:30.199 in the city it was so sweet and then he
02:09:33.620 pursued the porno thing with us he's
02:09:36.350 like you guys to understand you know and
02:09:39.080 then he talked us into he like I'm gonna
02:09:41.060 [ __ ] my girlfriend come over and listen
02:09:44.170 we would come over there at night and
02:09:46.550 listen that he would leave the window
02:09:48.050 open and it was his girlfriend and him
02:09:50.540 [ __ ] and she would be saying give it
02:09:52.280 to Kimmy milk
02:09:53.060 daddy daddy and we like get creeped out
02:09:56.840 right out there one day and then one day
02:10:01.280 we actually [ __ ] went back then
02:10:03.199 they'd be he got normal I think with the
02:10:06.580 misunderstanding with the one guy he got
02:10:08.719 normal like we somebody checked them and
02:10:11.660 he got normal and then like the next
02:10:14.420 summer wasn't he would come out and play
02:10:16.509 football with us with a robe Arlen no
02:10:19.029 underwear just his dick guy and we're
02:10:23.289 like what the [ __ ] is this guy though
02:10:25.269 like he went the desperate measures of
02:10:27.849 aversion and I think missus and Adi said
02:10:31.209 something to him you can't be doing that
02:10:33.219 around hand with you dick and he's like
02:10:34.989 no no I just want to get exercises
02:10:36.879 something like he told us something we
02:10:38.139 did and that was the end of that you
02:10:40.629 know what's the classic relationship the
02:10:42.759 classic relationship with with crazy old
02:10:48.009 gay guys is the crazy old gay guy in the
02:10:51.339 young guy that's having sex with them
02:10:53.199 for money right there's a lot of those
02:10:55.899 cases is that more accepted in the gay
02:10:59.379 community that is in the straight
02:11:00.789 community because like if a straight
02:11:02.769 community if a guy is paying a girl for
02:11:05.289 sex its prostitution and everybody's
02:11:08.979 upset but is that how it is in the gay
02:11:11.409 community like do guys give a [ __ ] like
02:11:14.079 how many gay prostitutes get arrested
02:11:16.809 is it even close to as many as straight
02:11:18.699 ones I got what assume ice I would
02:11:21.729 assume like no one's getting arrested
02:11:22.989 like is that how many gay prostitutes
02:11:27.339 get arrested I think they do you think
02:11:30.129 there's no but just less number so it's
02:11:31.839 probably how it courses a lot
02:11:33.699 you think there's less of them probably
02:11:37.329 less than overall process for the
02:11:39.009 numbers yeah we live in a place it's
02:11:41.379 made of dreams on people [ __ ] that
02:11:43.179 dreams don't do anything fun do anything
02:11:47.499 from Joe I mean look at all the
02:11:48.909 situations we've discussed just play
02:11:50.649 alone RV Erica Epstein Bikram you know
02:11:56.439 Marilyn Monroe that guy two weeks ago
02:11:59.679 that two people died of speed in this
02:12:01.629 house that [ __ ] nutcase that same guy
02:12:05.169 that's right
02:12:05.889 ed buck that more people died there no
02:12:08.139 I'm just finally Oh
02:12:11.879 oh my god it's such a shame that that's
02:12:15.999 what you do for a living this [ __ ] with
02:12:18.009 people's dreams
02:12:19.239 well I think that Ed Buck guys probably
02:12:21.279 had just a serious addict he's got some
02:12:24.639 money right you know taking him home was
02:12:27.249 God and shooting him up with drugs
02:12:29.409 drugs really you know when I first got
02:12:32.229 his a hot book was you'll never work in
02:12:34.030 this town again
02:12:34.780 hmm there was a hooker who [ __ ] did a
02:12:37.150 tell-all book about Don Henley calling
02:12:40.059 her up to a house and they had a bend
02:12:41.679 over
02:12:42.309 and Don Henley would snort coke off to
02:12:44.619 her [ __ ] whoo and then get up plug
02:12:46.989 him once and sit back down and just sit
02:12:48.969 there so you had to go to Don Henley's
02:12:51.369 house he has a fireplace for women he
02:12:54.070 would just say bend over naked god damn
02:12:56.320 don't snort coke get up [ __ ] you for a
02:12:59.769 minute and sit back down snore Marco you
02:13:02.289 know all those stories at different
02:13:05.019 movies I'd be [ __ ] like that
02:13:06.880 would you be disappointed if you lived
02:13:08.289 any other way I would think that if
02:13:09.820 you're living back then to rock star
02:13:12.070 back then like you almost were required
02:13:14.559 to do something ridiculous like

02:15:53.830 pissing on a chick which I never saw I
02:15:55.600 don't want to see it I mean I had no
02:15:57.340 [ __ ] desire to see that [ __ ] what do
02:15:59.980 you think that is you think he's
02:16:01.060 basically like like running well I was a
02:16:04.690 little bit of his last week and he comes
02:16:06.790 across to you he is professional is but
02:16:10.060 listen some people know wounded deal
02:16:14.350 when they see him and that's what these
02:16:15.910 woman is saying that his professional
02:16:18.400 his skill is the art of the wounded
02:16:22.240 woman and then he plays wounded but you
02:16:25.390 know who do you talk to him that within
02:16:27.490 the first day I'll tell you they got
02:16:28.720 sexually harassed not too many people so
02:16:32.770 as soon as he starts at that you start
02:16:34.600 with your story about your uncle and
02:16:37.209 he's gonna take care he's gonna do this
02:16:39.250 and this that's how he went in Oh
02:16:41.380 the stories that these woman is saying I
02:16:43.841 just
02:16:44.200 [ __ ] crazy like it's just other level
02:16:48.309 [ __ ] craziness my manipulation you
02:16:52.780 know it's just deep old-school pimping
02:16:55.150 me you and I want to see American pimp
02:16:56.799 yeah and we went to that barbecue place
02:16:59.020 you took me to a good barbecue place
02:17:00.850 next door with American papers that use
02:17:02.799 brothers just that mentality I was
02:17:06.790 spotting those type of woman's you know
02:17:09.400 it's [ __ ] up but it's horrible and I
02:17:11.320 feel terrible about it and it just makes
02:17:13.090 me feel sick hearing the story but what
02:17:14.770 makes me laugh is if we found out that
02:17:17.170 JLo had been capturing 15 year old boys
02:17:20.350 and pissing in their face we would think
02:17:22.000 it was hilarious
02:17:23.430 if JLo went to high school and she got
02:17:26.799 all these sophomores and she brought him
02:17:28.750 back to her place for a gangbang we
02:17:31.270 would think these kids had a good
02:17:32.740 [ __ ] time that is well it's it's one
02:17:35.680 of those big giant differences between
02:17:38.440 the way we feel about men and women this
02:17:40.870 r.kelly thing is horrible but it is it
02:17:43.809 is kind of funny that if our Kelly was
02:17:47.350 like a really beautiful woman and she
02:17:50.610 she was doing the exact same thing the
02:17:52.809 15 year old boys making them live with
02:17:54.250 her and eat her [ __ ] and she would say
02:17:55.750 it's hilarious we would just think it's
02:17:57.850 hilarious dollars doing it yeah
02:18:00.010 Madonna's doing it he does not read or
02:18:02.350 write exceedingly well except when it
02:18:04.570 comes to amazing musical tracks his his
02:18:06.400 turn he said okay he doesn't read or
02:18:11.680 write well that's sad
02:18:13.559 the whole thing set if it it is weird
02:18:16.870 our ideas of sex based on gender
02:18:20.530 it's [ __ ] very different very we feel
02:18:22.450 very different about that story there'll
02:18:24.850 be a hilarious story if there was some
02:18:27.218 big tittied freak singer who has their
02:18:31.059 little sex call and she brings fifteen
02:18:32.860 sixteen-year-old boys over we wouldn't
02:18:35.559 really we would be like wow but we
02:18:37.900 wouldn't feel like a crime got committed
02:18:39.190 were hypocrites because yes I make jokes
02:18:42.400 of it on Twitter I see it another 16
02:18:45.010 year old teacher sucks a dick you know
02:18:47.379 but then you think Jesus Christ I have a
02:18:49.389 daughter this swings both ways right
02:18:51.639 so we're hypocrites and we're hypocrites
02:18:53.860 on who we you know
02:18:56.669 for years we heard about Michael Jackson
02:18:58.978 there's people I'll look you in the
02:19:00.209 [ __ ] face and go Michael Jackson
02:19:02.010 never touch the kid yep
02:19:03.929 yeah we'll look you in the face today
02:19:05.849 and say Oh Jason didn't kill that [ __ ]
02:19:09.269 mmm there's people that are gonna think
02:19:11.189 what they think you're broken so yeah I
02:19:14.818 don't obviously have any idea what
02:19:17.459 happened with Michael Jackson but I
02:19:19.769 would assume that there was something
02:19:22.409 wrong just based on the way he behaved I
02:19:25.978 would say like what other things are

02:20:50.789 and go yeah
02:20:52.199 some of his addiction some of his this
02:20:54.930 lifestyle wasn't for them but there's a
02:20:57.300 percentage of them that one day you were
02:21:00.180 talking to them about writing jokes the
02:21:02.699 next day they were talking to you about
02:21:04.369 scripts and producing they just lost
02:21:07.350 their [ __ ]
02:21:08.130 my and drank the kool-aid and because

02:21:21.479 lot of guys who are promising comics who

02:23:04.050 it's always been that way we were
02:23:05.670 talking about Fatty Arbuckle earlier
02:23:07.310 what we pick and choose you don't think
02:23:10.500 that nobody no Behav wines name nobody
02:23:13.320 know by Harvey Weinstein nobody knew
02:23:16.470 that's what you're telling me have you
02:23:17.939 seen the video or Ricky Gervais jokes
02:23:20.040 around about
02:23:21.479 being friends with Harvey Weinstein in
02:23:23.970 the last Golden Globes and then there's
02:23:25.410 a whole series of people thanking Harvey
02:23:28.680 getting up there and thanking Harvey all
02:23:30.960 these including people that have accused
02:23:32.550 him of things getting up there and
02:23:33.990 thanking them and talking about how they
02:23:35.970 wouldn't be here if it wasn't for Harvey
02:23:37.650 Weinstein I mean it's like [ __ ] 10
02:23:39.689 minutes long it's all these famous
02:23:41.490 people thanking Harvey or God lol and
02:23:45.120 everybody's laughing like people people
02:23:47.550 were just giving him so much praise all
02:23:49.650 these like super famous actors Daniel
02:23:51.540 day-lewis everybody you name it
02:23:53.790 everybody Faye Dunaway whoever they're
02:23:57.960 all up there thanking Harvey Weinstein
02:23:59.550 he's amazing Harvey you're incredible
02:24:02.060 it's it's great then it's crazy if you
02:24:05.850 stop and think about how recent that was
02:24:07.610 and nobody knows I don't think they knew
02:24:12.439 unless he did it to them what it was you
02:24:16.620 know I think there's there's a an
02:24:19.080 innocence to a lot of people's
02:24:21.660 perceptions about people like that is
02:24:23.490 that like both parties are in on it
02:24:25.590 right like the girl wants to go to him
02:24:28.740 because he is gonna offer her a role in
02:24:31.350 a movie and he wants the girl to come to
02:24:34.260 him because she's hot and he wants his
02:24:35.729 dick sucked and they both know it right
02:24:38.189 there's those cases but those are very
02:24:41.640 different than the ones where he holds a
02:24:44.220 girl down or he takes off his robe when
02:24:46.530 she expected it to be a real script and
02:24:48.800 those are very very different things and
02:24:51.530 I don't know if people knew about those
02:24:54.990 I think they thought it was more of the
02:24:58.020 former than the latter I think they
02:24:59.340 thought it was more like creepy deals he
02:25:01.710 made with actresses but kept his word
02:25:03.570 and they sucked his dick but then when
02:25:05.640 you get the other stories makes me go
02:25:06.900 okay it's probably because they knew but
02:25:11.700 the people around him knew he's a pig
02:25:14.310 but probably didn't know what the the
02:25:17.729 worst accusations were you know I just
02:25:22.380 didn't wanna know job that - that could
02:25:24.630 be a commit they know but they didn't
02:25:27.600 want to know I had to go to his parties
02:25:29.970 they had a heat of this meals they how
02:25:32.550 to attend this
02:25:33.450 functions but they didn't really pass a
02:25:35.760 line yeah there's those people too right
02:25:38.940 and then in the amazing movies too in it
02:25:41.550 in a way it's just as guilty if I tell
02:25:44.670 you right now I'm going to shoot Redman
02:25:46.830 and you sit here
02:25:48.840 I shoot red band you get prosecuted oh
02:25:53.720 that's right yeah you get an accessory
02:25:56.460 your knowledge so you know when one
02:26:00.900 Epstein or Weinstein or one of these
02:26:03.061 [ __ ] guys are doing what they were
02:26:04.470 doing you hadn't known I take you to a
02:26:08.670 bar with employment you look at me and

02:26:21.210 a [ __ ] I see a chick work of a guy
02:26:23.670 for the small nickel I even heard the
02:26:26.970 guy look at him go 500 it was that first
02:26:31.050 row were you sitting there bars right
02:26:33.061 there about three four months ago must
02:26:35.400 have been you know it's it's this is it
02:26:39.601 yeah well remember when the guy from the
02:26:42.570 Clippers got in trouble what's that
02:26:44.670 guy's name the owner yeah what was his
02:26:46.771 name sterling sterling Donald Donald
02:26:50.610 sterling right when he got got recorded
02:26:54.980 saying the chick yeah it was a girl that
02:26:57.570 he was banging with this girl he had
02:26:59.580 bought her a penthouse
02:27:01.410 he bought a Ferrari bought her a Bentley
02:27:04.470 it's just and she was for him super hot
02:27:08.010 like look at her that is a pretty girl
02:27:10.050 and he's a disgusting looking old man
02:27:12.830 right so that was his uber side piece so
02:27:19.170 he would just buy her everything
02:27:20.641 but after a while she's like yo enough
02:27:24.740 yo pretty hot though and like that kind
02:27:31.530 of trash away now is that in me to
02:27:35.280 situation no that's listen that's it
02:27:37.740 that's was he was clear and she was
02:27:40.500 clear they were both doing it for very
02:27:42.780 specific reasons he bought her a bunch
02:27:44.400 of really nice [ __ ] and he was rich
02:27:46.930 and she was hot and that's is that her
02:27:49.330 now what's that the state of her face
02:27:51.729 like I started wearing if you wanna get
02:27:53.080 seen oh that was back in the day when
02:27:54.880 pepper Otzi yeah let me enjoy now let me
02:27:58.029 ask you let me ask you you bump into
02:28:00.010 this broad ah okay at the last or is it
02:28:04.810 a meat to situation if you don't listen
02:28:06.880 are you working I think they have to
02:28:11.229 come to you first
02:28:12.310 what if okay 500 fell on my pocket you
02:28:17.229 sucked me you know like right is this a
02:28:19.270 you soliciting prostitution are you
02:28:21.520 soliciting an agreement or is that a
02:28:23.380 meat to situation it's all the above I
02:28:26.069 think the only way people would be
02:28:29.260 comfortable with it and even then they
02:28:31.180 probably wouldn't like like if if you
02:28:33.069 believe in people's rights you have the
02:28:35.560 right to do anything well you also have
02:28:37.029 the right to be a ho if you wanted to be
02:28:38.949 oh so if the only way would ever be okay
02:28:42.040 is if she made it clear that she was
02:28:45.699 willing to have sex for money and this
02:28:48.160 was her choice she could do with her
02:28:49.899 body then people probably leave you
02:28:51.100 alone but even then they'd be mad at you
02:28:52.479 they'd be willing to pay for sex you
02:28:54.279 [ __ ] disgusting piece of [ __ ] you
02:28:56.560 know you're supposed to pretend that you
02:28:57.880 don't want to have sex with her and then
02:28:59.109 you wouldn't be willing to pay for it it
02:29:02.140 would only be okay in everybody's eyes
02:29:04.149 if it was the woman's choice but every
02:29:05.800 time we think about if you think about
02:29:07.600 sex for money everybody autumn at least
02:29:09.550 I do I automatically think about sex
02:29:11.770 trafficking which is like the worst
02:29:13.689 possible case scenario right if you go
02:29:16.330 to a prostitute that that prostitute is
02:29:18.040 that's that's a sex slave right that was
02:29:21.640 the thing that they got the craft guy
02:29:23.229 they were they were using a false
02:29:25.239 accusation against that guy that got

02:34:49.270 man dick

02:34:51.909 when I go like the Vegas they got those
02:34:53.529 good mirrors
02:34:55.229 when you get you're at home you look at
02:34:57.460 your different looks the way it does
02:34:58.510 everything cuz you're used to that
02:34:59.949 mirror right it's not that you going
02:35:01.779 away
02:35:02.109 you walk back your walk past [ __ ] on
02:35:05.770 a vacation or something when you're on
02:35:07.540 the road working you walk past a mirror
02:35:09.760 and it catches you like I'm getting a
02:35:11.080 little fat like the real hotel mirrors
02:35:13.960 don't [ __ ] around is that there's a lake
02:35:15.880 there but when you look at 56 my dick
02:35:20.050 has been through hell

02:35:42.010 the world before I go to bed I drink
02:35:44.319 water a little bit of Thai cherry juice
02:35:46.120 and I'd take a [ __ ] baby aspirin
02:35:48.850 because the high level after 50 is to
02:35:50.680 get the heart attack between 5:30 and 12
02:35:52.810 I was making a mistake and taking my
02:35:54.850 aspirin at 7:00 it's too late you gotta

02:37:17.750 training camps and other people on the
02:37:19.609 card or whatnot
02:37:20.649 everybody's forcing you to port that
02:37:23.870 Conor McGregor after this weekend nobody
02:37:26.720 not even our man Jaime had [ __ ] the
02:37:29.899 Tennessee Titans to beat Baltimore
02:37:32.390 nobody nobody nobody ever been their
02:37:36.530 mother but Baltimore no even John Rael
02:37:38.689 to said something the John rival to say
02:37:41.390 something it was like it wasn't gonna
02:37:42.710 happen Baltimore had been on a hot roll
02:37:44.979 Baltimore there was another upset to
02:37:47.030 Kansas City that beat the Texans right
02:37:50.600 here this late 2014 they were down 24
02:37:53.120 nothing when you pull up the UFC card
02:37:55.130 for this weekend so I could see who's on
02:37:56.450 the card that's right there's the okay
02:38:01.840 so what everybody's gonna be trying to
02:38:05.990 bet Cerrone well that what's the line
02:38:08.780 that's around right now so you could I
02:38:10.910 get what this is plus two sixty four
02:38:13.040 plus two sixteen over under one and a
02:38:14.840 half rounds mm-hmm but then I go over
02:38:18.050 one and a half what do I make I make a
02:38:20.540 little more money than that the over the
02:38:22.880 under would be the little bit plus the
02:38:25.040 plus 105 for under so that I guess the
02:38:27.440 money is on the over right now it's
02:38:30.351 minus 135 how can the [ __ ] money be
02:38:32.930 in the oval piece of light it's very
02:38:34.700 slight though okay look so this Diego
02:38:37.851 for Hara is the favorite over Anthony
02:38:40.880 Pettis mmm that's an interesting fight
02:38:43.430 right there for right there they know
02:38:45.170 something we don't know hmm that's
02:38:46.760 interesting
02:38:47.480 Diego is very good it's a very good
02:38:49.010 fighter but Holly Holm Rachael Penton
02:38:51.891 yeah that's good fight Holly Holmes
02:38:54.440 given right excuse me
02:38:56.420 she's a favorite Holly yeah yeah yeah
02:38:59.360 Rachel Pennington is tough man she's
02:39:02.811 very tough painting is one of those
02:39:04.311 chicks it like she's had some
02:39:06.160 last-second wins like against Ashlee
02:39:09.950 evans-smith one of the like wildest
02:39:12.860 endings in a female fight she gets her
02:39:15.410 in a bulldog choke and chokes are
02:39:17.630 unconscious with blood spraying out of
02:39:19.880 her forehead
02:39:20.480 it was a wild finish man see if he could
02:39:23.870 find that finish Ashlee evans-smith
02:39:26.420 Raquel Pennington finishes Ashlee
02:39:28.730 evans-smith so right now what does that
02:39:30.771 look like Donald Cerrone against Conor
02:39:33.530 what's the money looked like I don't
02:39:34.700 understand money like I don't know I
02:39:36.950 would I would be just talking out of my
02:39:38.900 have spent a hundred bucks on cowboy to
02:39:41.630 win and he wins the fight you'd get to
02:39:44.271 60 so you'd collect 360 and if you bet a
02:39:47.570 hundred on Conor you'd have to bet 320
02:39:50.630 bucks to win a hundred on Conor
02:39:52.840 all right minus 320 the only way you can
02:39:56.330 win this weekend is with Connor and you
02:40:00.470 see Connor go on and then knocking him
02:40:02.240 out in the first round in the under what
02:40:05.330 if Connor
02:40:05.900 if [ __ ] wrestles them and it goes five
02:40:09.740 rounds I don't see a lot of people
02:40:12.680 betting Connor in the over final looks
02:40:15.530 so good that people are expecting common
02:40:17.601 going that this is come right out this
02:40:20.180 is Raquel Penningtons fight
02:40:22.220 so just go to like towards the end of it
02:40:25.240 it was a wild fight then and Ashlee
02:40:28.340 evans-smith is the woman who beat Fallon
02:40:31.130 Fox the transgender fighter she stopped
02:40:34.910 her in her fight right before she came
02:40:37.790 to the UFC it was just a wild fight man
02:40:40.940 these girls were going to war and so at
02:40:44.030 the very last I mean I think it was like
02:40:47.060 the last second of the fight she's
02:40:50.030 locking her up in this bulldog choke and
02:40:51.950 this is why like a blood is spraying out
02:40:54.020 of her head oh they don't show the
02:40:55.220 finish
02:40:55.820 that's UFC it's sneaky like that they
02:40:57.530 don't even see the tap or the knockout
02:40:59.360 like I don't get it guys I work for you
02:41:02.030 I love you show everybody the choke why
02:41:04.940 are you hiding the choke anyway maybe
02:41:07.700 it's just a time constraint but she got
02:41:09.500 her in this bulldog choke blood is
02:41:11.600 squirting out of her head and then at
02:41:14.300 the end of the the buzzer she lets go
02:41:16.160 and the girls out cold and it was just
02:41:17.900 like whoa it was one of those fight just
02:41:20.870 whoa what's happening you like holy [ __ ]
02:41:23.840 you know you see something that's just
02:41:25.340 primal there's moments and fights that
02:41:27.770 are just primal you know it's sometimes
02:41:30.950 those moments are like they're almost
02:41:32.120 surreal like when Francis and gone to
02:41:34.729 knock down Alistair Overeem boom oh just
02:41:38.390 primal just what who cut his lip who
02:41:41.210 [ __ ] up oh Rosen strike oh my god
02:41:43.910 Rosen strikes now gonna fight Francis
02:41:45.940 Giardino Rosen strike and Francis and
02:41:49.010 Ghana where Columbus Ohio god damn
02:41:53.360 that's a crazy fight I almost wish more
02:41:57.680 people knew how tough Rosen strike is
02:42:00.770 you see the fight with Alistair Overeem
02:42:04.280 and you go well ouster was kind of out
02:42:06.590 pointing him and then he caught Alistair
02:42:08.930 slippin really with like 10 seconds left
02:42:11.030 to go in the fight and hit him with a
02:42:12.170 bomb and broke his lip open that's true
02:42:14.420 but he still absorbed everything that
02:42:17.300 Alistair threw at him did never look
02:42:19.640 like he gets shook at all we're talking
02:42:20.960 about a guy and Alistair who's knocked
02:42:22.729 out Junior dos Santos knocked out you
02:42:25.580 know it was the k1 grand prix champion
02:42:27.400 no tremendous really knocked out Todd
02:42:30.110 Duffee in prize [ __ ] knocked out our
02:42:32.240 boys riser he needed your boy there
02:42:35.270 [ __ ] the great white hope
02:42:38.759 you know what's his name
02:42:40.229 mark hunt you know he's great white hope
02:42:42.899 he's Australian Oh Brock Lesnar
02:42:47.159 raucous that's a perfect example of him
02:42:49.709 but meanwhile rosin strikes just walked
02:42:51.749 through all that and I'm not suggesting
02:42:53.489 that the the Alistar of today he's had a
02:42:56.369 long career that he's as as durable and
02:42:59.069 as big as he was when he fought Brock
02:43:01.049 Lesnar there's really two different guys
02:43:02.279 at this point but still Rosen strike
02:43:04.649 he's a [ __ ] beast he's so strong man
02:43:07.709 and he's got legit kickboxing skills
02:43:09.869 what do you see he can fight we can do
02:43:11.579 money this is what it seems to me it
02:43:15.359 seems to me that Conor McGregor has an
02:43:19.560 advantage in being able to close the
02:43:22.229 distance and maybe a speed advantage
02:43:24.899 this is a perceived thing based on
02:43:27.869 seeing them fight different people
02:43:29.899 cowboy when he's at his best is
02:43:34.099 remarkably well-rounded and I think he's
02:43:37.109 more well-rounded than Conor
02:43:38.909 I think cowboy has a lot of tools that
02:43:42.509 people forget about particularly his
02:43:44.159 takedowns are excellent cowboy can
02:43:46.829 submit the [ __ ] out of you he submits a
02:43:48.599 lot of people he's nasty off his back
02:43:50.459 he's got wicked triangles I could see if
02:43:53.759 this went to the ground
02:43:55.349 Connor getting submitted by cowboy in
02:43:58.349 the Triangle what I couldn't see is
02:44:00.509 cowboy getting submitted by Conor in a
02:44:03.119 triangle I could see I could see Cowboys
02:44:05.849 submitting Connor I would I don't think
02:44:07.859 it's impossible for Connor to submit
02:44:10.919 cowboy but I don't see it I think Connor
02:44:14.520 can win by knockout yes he's very fast
02:44:17.639 yes his left hand is a [ __ ] piston
02:44:20.369 and he's sneaky and he's got nasty
02:44:22.709 uppercuts and he's got a killer instinct
02:44:24.869 when he has you heard he [ __ ] bombs
02:44:26.579 on you and the idea of the Eddie Alvarez
02:44:28.529 fight is the best example that Eddie
02:44:30.569 Alvarez was a world-class fighter and
02:44:32.789 Conor McGregor took it to him like no
02:44:35.009 one has ever done in his career tuned
02:44:36.899 him up made him look like he had no
02:44:38.579 business in the cage with them now for
02:44:40.679 Eddie he said like he just fought about
02:44:42.270 fight and I believe I'm in the eighties
02:44:44.129 a world-class fighter but the point is
02:44:46.439 in in go time Conor McGregor handles
02:44:49.899 as better as much or better as good as
02:44:53.380 well or better than anyone who's ever
02:44:54.760 lived he handles pressure so well kiss
02:44:58.479 his Floyd Mayweather with an uppercut in
02:45:00.789 a fight where he's so outclassed he has
02:45:03.220 zero boxing matches and he's fighting
02:45:05.229 the greatest boxer of all time in one of
02:45:07.840 the biggest pay-per-view cards ever it's
02:45:09.970 nuts right so he can handle pressure he
02:45:12.880 lost that fight because Floyd's a way
02:45:14.890 better boxer but he handled the pressure
02:45:17.439 pressure against Aldo talked so much
02:45:19.810 [ __ ] for a year going on tour together
02:45:21.939 tearing pictures of him stealing his
02:45:23.560 belt gets in front of him flatlines I'm
02:45:26.140 in 13 seconds perfect punch perfect
02:45:28.630 execution like it measures him with one
02:45:31.449 left hand before that steps back he
02:45:33.999 dives in with the lab bang catches him
02:45:36.399 coming in it's perfect under pressure
02:45:39.600 he's not the kind of grappler that
02:45:45.340 nurmagomedov is he's not in that
02:45:48.069 category have pressure on this fight oh
02:45:50.169 he's got so much pressure he fought he
02:45:52.720 fought the guy who everyone's terrified
02:45:54.369 of and at least he made it into the
02:45:56.680 fourth round right was in the fourth
02:45:57.850 round submission yeah and he probably
02:46:00.069 wasn't really prepared for that fight
02:46:01.930 you think about how much time he'd been
02:46:03.279 off of MMA how much time he'd be working
02:46:05.199 on you know just boxing and then
02:46:06.669 spending all that money because he made
02:46:08.109 like a hundred million dollars the
02:46:10.539 question for me is who is Conor right
02:46:13.869 now is Conor McGregor the same guy that
02:46:15.970 knocked out Boston Dustin Poirier when
02:46:17.979 he was a savage is he the same guy that
02:46:20.609 knocked out Diego Brandao is he is he
02:46:23.859 the same guy that knocked out Jose Aldo
02:46:27.010 is he the same guy who knocked out Eddie
02:46:28.510 Alvarez or is he just some new thing cuz
02:46:31.419 all this money and all this Fame and all
02:46:33.189 this attention he likes to party and I
02:46:34.779 what does he know if he's the same guy
02:46:38.739 and physically there should be no reason
02:46:40.630 why he isn't he hasn't taken any
02:46:42.069 terrible beatings even the number
02:46:43.749 comment' off fight he stopped him with a
02:46:44.949 choke if he is the same guy and he
02:46:50.020 decides he wants to let the [ __ ]
02:46:51.939 world know that he can still do it and
02:46:53.859 who gives a [ __ ] how much money he has
02:46:55.510 in the bank he wants to let the world
02:46:57.130 know he's here to [ __ ] people up and
02:46:59.169 he's here to reclaim his crown if he
02:47:01.300 goes into the fight with that attitude
02:47:03.400 I mean we could certainly see a
02:47:07.480 resurgence the question has always been
02:47:09.400 whether or not a rich man has the
02:47:11.140 motivation to work like a poor man and
02:47:14.250 he's a very rich man
02:47:16.510 we don't know everybody's different
02:47:18.250 mayweather fought hard to the day he
02:47:19.990 died or he excuse me to the day he
02:47:21.700 retired and Mayweather when he was
02:47:23.800 during his career it was rich like from
02:47:26.430 like a couple years and he was rich he
02:47:29.410 was rich so he was always rich and still
02:47:32.440 fought like the best of the world and
02:47:35.561 still trained like you have to train to
02:47:37.780 be the best what type of gaps was he
02:47:39.521 taking him between fights guys this has
02:47:42.190 been a long gap before no my god it's
02:47:44.771 not fair yeah before no mega mega wolf
02:47:47.590 it was a long gap you know this is true
02:47:50.410 the game has evolved a lot hmm you know
02:47:53.320 you know in a real world I can get what
02:47:56.050 you heard me telling Jamie was basically
02:47:59.021 this in a real world you know sir wrong
02:48:03.630 what's he done in the last five fights
02:48:05.800 around he's gay he's had some ups and
02:48:09.370 downs ups and glossa kg lost to Maz
02:48:12.340 Vidal lost real bad - Darren tell the
02:48:16.750 Dare until one was a battle so how do
02:48:18.730 the last five fights he's two and three
02:48:20.620 is where you tell was lost to Tony
02:48:22.390 Ferguson beat al Iaquinta though and
02:48:26.980 looked real [ __ ] good doing it so
02:48:29.170 he's lost to the gauge he fight and he
02:48:34.811 beat Mike Perry which was a really good
02:48:37.271 fight for him because Mike Perry is a
02:48:39.040 big scary guy throws bombs so he beat
02:48:42.521 him lost to Leon Edwards I think he was
02:48:44.950 sick coming into that fight but you know
02:48:46.840 lost either way and beat Yancy Medeiros
02:48:50.470 in a while Rama is saying that in a real
02:48:52.900 world he should take em out people look
02:48:54.940 at him
02:48:55.510 I don't think this is gonna be that easy
02:48:57.101 of a fight I like it I like the over I
02:48:59.970 love the over I don't I can't pick a
02:49:03.280 side yet yeah but I love the over I
02:49:06.311 could see everybody betting McGregor the
02:49:08.710 wooden round one and something crazy
02:49:12.101 happened I mean in a perfect world you
02:49:15.400 know
02:49:16.221 his chin has been a little suspect
02:49:18.921 lately Donald I don't know I don't think
02:49:21.591 so I think he's just been fighting
02:49:22.820 werewolves has been fighting the the
02:49:25.490 toughest guys in the world look
02:49:26.601 everybody's chin suspect if Darren tail
02:49:28.701 is smashing your [ __ ] nose open with
02:49:30.650 an elbow that dudes an animal and he's
02:49:32.990 big as [ __ ] when Darren tail fought
02:49:35.661 cowboy he's so much bigger than him
02:49:37.131 there was the difference between a
02:49:37.971 really big welterweight and a guy who
02:49:40.581 came up from lightweight Darren tails a
02:49:42.681 giant dude I mean his nicknames the
02:49:44.391 gorilla so here we go yeah he beat
02:49:47.091 Iaquinta he beat alexander hernandez
02:49:49.461 that was a fantastic fight that was a
02:49:51.201 fantastic fight because right this kid
02:49:53.121 Hernandez is a young tough guy was
02:49:55.311 talking mad [ __ ] but there's a giant
02:49:57.860 difference between no disrespect to
02:50:00.471 Hernandez and a Conor McGregor yes
02:50:02.841 Conor McGregor is used to those bright
02:50:04.101 lights man he shines he shines in those
02:50:06.411 bright lights to me the question is
02:50:07.881 really just whether or not he has the
02:50:10.461 motivation to train and fight like a
02:50:12.980 [ __ ] madman again like he did when he
02:50:15.351 was younger when he was smashing people
02:50:16.791 and for cowboy it's whether or not he
02:50:19.041 can survive the early storm
02:50:20.511 I think getting his leg kicks working
02:50:22.431 would be very big because Conor likes to
02:50:24.351 take that long stance Conor takes that
02:50:26.751 long stance and he fights right leg
02:50:28.791 forward
02:50:29.271 he fights southpaw and if Donald can
02:50:31.971 [ __ ] up that right leg he can figure out
02:50:34.190 a way to attack that right leg knees to
02:50:36.891 the body coming in he's got to avoid the
02:50:38.541 punches though yep he's up there with uh
02:50:40.581 who do I say he's with he's with Sergio
02:50:44.061 Pettis is coach up there he's training
02:50:46.581 yeah you should do Rufus Rufus sport if
02:50:48.771 he's a walking sport for this camp
02:50:51.201 they're probably working on a lot of
02:50:53.271 kickboxing but I guarantee woodlings
02:50:56.230 Woodley and Emma doing some wrestling
02:50:58.701 takedown because he knows that's where
02:51:01.011 the money literally has a big fight
02:51:02.480 coming up Willie's gonna fight Leon
02:51:04.610 Edwards and Leon Edwards is a dangerous
02:51:06.951 man it's like that's a that's a big
02:51:08.541 fight and Leon Edwards for whatever
02:51:11.690 reason is not known as much as he is
02:51:14.631 skillful you know he beat cowboy like
02:51:17.301 you said and he's the guy that got in
02:51:18.831 that crazy brawl with Maas Vidal
02:51:20.211 backstage Bosma doll hit with your
02:51:22.011 two-piece in the soda but that's that
02:51:24.740 guy's a tough tough tough guy super
02:51:27.230 highly skilled guy and Leon Edwards
02:51:30.021 and tyron woodley that's a very
02:51:31.461 high-stakes fight that a lot of people
02:51:33.290 aren't talking about like that's the
02:51:34.790 fight for the number one contender
02:51:37.490 because if tyrant emerged or if Leon
02:51:40.971 emerges and it's and it's a big fight
02:51:43.790 and it the fight goes well that person
02:51:46.700 is almost certainly at least considered
02:51:50.211 other than Mozgov doll who's the fan
02:51:52.881 favorite and then the rematch those are
02:51:55.490 those are the two possibilities the read
02:51:57.171 the rematch with Kobe a new smart other
02:51:59.271 than that you want to see you want to
02:52:02.091 see the winner of tyron woodley in Leon
02:52:04.431 Edwards it just makes sense it make
02:52:06.261 sense that that would be the next one or
02:52:07.761 MOSFET all those those that's how I
02:52:09.921 would look at it I would look at it that
02:52:11.330 way I would look at it like there's
02:52:12.851 there's a lot of options there's a lot
02:52:15.830 of options for that division and now
02:52:17.271 Connors talking about fighting us Mon
02:52:19.101 that would be bonkers
02:52:21.171 so if Connor beats cowboy and decides he
02:52:26.150 feels great at this weight he feels
02:52:28.070 confident now and dedicated he wants to
02:52:29.990 make a run at the [ __ ] champ there is
02:52:32.931 a big size difference which in Vaughn
02:52:35.540 and Connor who's Mon is a big person
02:52:38.961 he's got a thick around those 170 guys a
02:52:41.870 big that big Kobe's a big fella dead
02:52:45.290 Colby's a big Feldman's Big Show is
02:52:48.381 [ __ ] Mazda without big 1:7 yep it's
02:52:52.370 somebody else at 170 that's deceiving
02:52:54.141 his [ __ ] - I think Mazda I was in the
02:52:56.301 sweet spot he's not too big where I said
02:52:58.190 to kill himself to make the way but he's
02:52:59.990 he could obviously knock out
02:53:01.521 welterweight it's easily he's knocked
02:53:03.200 out a lot of welterweights
02:53:04.400 I mean the the Ben Askren one is [ __ ]
02:53:06.860 preposterous but of course just even the
02:53:09.320 beating that he's putting on Nate Diaz
02:53:10.940 Maz Woodall can [ __ ] people up at 170 I
02:53:14.561 mean I think him vs Conor would be
02:53:18.080 insane you [ __ ] me up dawg
02:53:20.001 you [ __ ] me up by not bringing back
02:53:21.980 the ran with you that boy that you were
02:53:27.501 telling me this I got Duran I'm gonna
02:53:28.881 put him up at the compound for a week
02:53:30.440 you know I went down a foxhole of his
02:53:32.900 fights oh he was amazing a lot of month
02:53:34.881 ago just that whole era yeah I've been
02:53:37.160 turning people on just tell that hold I
02:53:39.021 really a dad was we're talking my mom
02:53:41.280 so because I got pissed off with that
02:53:43.560 [ __ ] Vikram thing because he said he
02:53:46.440 came to the United States on the
02:53:47.760 pretension that he had won three
02:53:50.010 national yoga competitions in India and
02:53:53.670 I'm not that stupid I grew up on Wide
02:53:55.560 World of Sports we learned everything I
02:53:58.050 don't want world sports
02:53:58.980 I saw a dude catch a bullet with his
02:54:02.490 mouth on Aaron bankses Parliament Aaron
02:54:06.990 banks karate tournament yeah really in
02:54:09.480 New York City we caught a bull with his
02:54:11.580 teeth Aaron bankfull higher there was a
02:54:13.770 dude who that's what he was known for
02:54:15.930 it's on YouTube is that real Joey he did
02:54:22.140 they put a glass in front of the guy the
02:54:25.020 bullet goes through the glass - he put a
02:54:27.960 special mouthpiece on and they shoot and
02:54:31.080 then look how close was the glass watch
02:54:34.080 let me go pee real quick okay play that
02:54:37.050 for me give me some volume okay so it's
02:54:43.140 just music that's right so his name is
02:54:45.980 Ralph can I see it well this is
02:54:49.200 supposedly the video I thought what's
02:54:51.330 happening here maybe not
02:54:52.320 I just fries Jonah in slow-mo but
02:54:54.960 there's got to be like someone who
02:54:57.000 Snopes is this
02:54:58.110 I believe Penn & Teller do it now they
02:55:02.580 do it yeah they catch a bullet in their
02:55:04.380 teeth huh well Penn would be the first
02:55:07.110 one to tell you it's [ __ ] I mean
02:55:10.740 that's a hit half of their stick I
02:55:14.370 should probably get him back in here
02:55:15.990 have him explain how the [ __ ] something
02:55:18.300 catches a bullet in their teeth there's
02:55:19.770 no [ __ ] might not be the way to do
02:55:21.990 it but there's a way to do it that's
02:55:23.880 safer then there's shooting a gun at
02:55:27.330 your teeth I think I don't think they
02:55:29.160 shoot a gun at your teeth because I
02:55:30.570 don't think you could do that a whole
02:55:31.470 lot of times see if a guy's doing that
02:55:33.900 it's not he's doing it I think I can do
02:55:35.460 it dad okay give it a shot son now he's
02:55:37.410 done it before right he's doing this
02:55:39.150 bullet thing in front of people I would
02:55:41.340 assume that's not the first and only
02:55:42.540 time just catching a bullet his teeth
02:55:43.890 David Blaine did it - right but you
02:55:46.440 listen to me yeah that means you have to
02:55:47.910 practice how many times you let it do to
02:55:50.190 shoot you in the face
02:55:51.060 how are you practicing that that's not
02:55:54.000 real David Blaine
02:55:55.021 with a metal cup in his mouth Wow so the
02:55:58.200 metal cup caught the bullet another guy
02:55:59.790 wore I think this guy that's Joey watch
02:56:01.711 had steel dentures Oh God even if you
02:56:05.521 had steel dentures I'm gonna shoot you
02:56:07.381 in the face and you got to make sure
02:56:09.841 that they don't hit your lips do you
02:56:11.400 know how hard it is and not hit someone
02:56:12.811 how close do you have to be do you wear
02:56:15.480 your with a pistol is that what they
02:56:17.280 using you can absolutely sure 357 oh
02:56:20.400 Jesus
02:56:21.480 there's no way that can't be real one
02:56:24.540 person died doing it
02:56:25.681 of course they shoot ling-su the most
02:56:28.261 famous person to die were doing the
02:56:29.521 trick always performs silently because
02:56:31.860 he apparently spoke no English Heath
02:56:33.540 when his final performance of the trick
02:56:36.001 went wrong and he was accidentally shot
02:56:38.851 in the chest exclaimed in perfect
02:56:41.101 English oh my god something's happened
02:56:43.080 lower the curtain at his autopsy it was
02:56:46.021 discovered that he was not Chinese but
02:56:48.301 an American named William Robinson but
02:56:51.091 that's a story for another day his scam
02:56:57.870 was he let people shoot him and he catch
02:56:59.580 the bullet in his teeth and his name is
02:57:01.950 Chung Ling soo and he pretended he was
02:57:03.931 Chinese but then he accidentally got
02:57:05.190 shot in the chest - got it and shoot him
02:57:06.631 in the mouth shot him in the chest
02:57:07.381 instead and he as he dropped down he
02:57:10.381 said oh my god something's happened
02:57:11.881 lower the curtain in perfect English so
02:57:13.891 the autopsy revealed that he was not
02:57:15.301 Chinese but an American named William
02:57:17.461 Robinson can't do that today cultural
02:57:20.280 appropriation but even back then that's
02:57:23.671 a hilarious way to die was just one of
02:57:29.040 the guys that was catching bullets with
02:57:30.450 his ass it was a couple of [ __ ]
02:57:32.730 lunatic so that's how I know I grew up
02:57:34.471 on Wild Bill the sports they showed you
02:57:36.211 everything but I got caught in a foxhole
02:57:38.641 they had Hagler tackling the Rabi ooh
02:57:44.540 Maccabi was amazed death because in
02:57:46.860 those days they used to do a
02:57:48.181 pay-per-view on Saturday and then you
02:57:50.551 had a wait a week yeah first Saturday
02:57:54.240 Sunday Sal no next next out the
02:57:57.751 following Saturday be on white rule of
02:57:59.551 sports if you can hold on but I still
02:58:01.171 remember dog being a [ __ ] kid on a
02:58:03.391 Saturday
02:58:04.340 and watching doom come Kim and Mancini
02:58:08.050 [ __ ] out of each other because that
02:58:10.670 was live on was Lobby seen Barbara
02:58:14.740 absolutely you know cook him that was
02:58:17.750 the reason why they changed the the
02:58:20.149 round number from 15 down to 12 after
02:58:22.880 that guy died was that again this was
02:58:26.800 out it looks like it's outside doesn't
02:58:29.270 it yeah it is outside outside yeah
02:58:33.010 that's crazy
02:58:34.700 Tim Ron you this had a January or
02:58:37.280 February of 83 dude this is a crazy
02:58:42.070 November 18 to like two months before
02:58:44.090 that November of 82 Mancini was an
02:58:47.359 animal
02:58:48.140 remember we fought Alexis argüello I
02:58:50.240 think that's this right here says he huh
02:58:51.920 the Korean guy do cuddle King God rest
02:58:54.350 his soul wrote on a piece of wood before
02:58:56.840 you went out to fight and kill or be
02:58:59.540 killed
02:59:00.200 yeah that guy was a tough [ __ ]
02:59:02.149 ray boom-boom Mancini
02:59:04.600 but what tough [ __ ] this was
02:59:07.510 1979 he was 21 years old is this a duck
02:59:10.520 who Kim fight so imagine he killed
02:59:12.590 somebody when he was 21 years old in a
02:59:14.330 fight that is hardcore man
02:59:19.120 probably both things and then also
02:59:21.350 probably probably how to make weight a
02:59:23.450 lot of deaths in boxing apparently
02:59:25.850 happened in the lower weight classes and
02:59:27.590 one of the reasons is that when these
02:59:29.060 guys actually enter into fights a lot of
02:59:31.880 times they're still dehydrated they
02:59:33.410 would dehydrate them selves pretty bad
02:59:35.000 in the weigh-ins to get to whatever
02:59:39.170 weight class it was like 134 but he
02:59:41.420 probably weighs you know 134 out of
02:59:44.540 quarters what he waited and he probably
02:59:45.800 walks around like 150 ish or something
02:59:47.780 like that and they dehydrate themselves
02:59:50.210 it's very difficult to rehydrate the
02:59:51.950 brain apparently it's not as quick and
02:59:54.050 easy as it is rehydrating the body and
02:59:55.939 even that takes some time so most of the
02:59:59.330 deaths in boxing have occurred most of
03:00:02.720 them is still very dangerous even for
03:00:04.220 the heavyweight division there was a guy
03:00:05.420 who went into a coma Russian guy in a
03:00:08.510 fight a few years back but in the
03:00:12.500 lighter weight divisions they think it's
03:00:14.960 generally when people get
03:00:17.131 more more more likely to die from fights
03:00:20.521 and they think it might have something
03:00:22.021 to do with cutting weight but it's also
03:00:24.061 like you know really skillful people
03:00:26.701 punch each other in the head the general
03:00:28.591 mcclellan fight is a good example that
03:00:30.061 they always point to because Gerald
03:00:32.190 McClellan who was just a straight-up
03:00:34.371 murderer when he was a light heavyweight
03:00:37.341 really struggled to make weight man real
03:00:39.961 bad and in one fight with Nigel Benn
03:00:44.571 Nigel Benn got off the deck and it
03:00:48.001 looked like he was out and made it back
03:00:49.650 into the ring fought his ass off and
03:00:52.381 then started taking it to Gerald but
03:00:54.751 this don't come come right here again
03:00:56.581 yeah and that was the end of the fight
03:00:58.621 after ray Mancini stopped him
03:01:00.271 everybody's all happy within the guy
03:01:02.071 slides into a coma mines up dying see
03:01:05.730 he's sitting there like so he's he's
03:01:08.311 really battered they think again I think
03:01:12.150 it might have something to do with
03:01:13.021 cutting weight it's a [ __ ] horrible
03:01:16.921 horrible way to go man but kill or be
03:01:22.051 killed that's what he signed up for
03:01:23.521 actually wrote before yeah I mean he
03:01:27.480 fought that way too you know what I saw
03:01:29.611 recently there's one of the wildest

03:02:02.071 then and Leonard was just I mean he was
03:02:05.011 America's darling Olympic gold medalist
03:02:07.471 handsome sweetheart of a guy and Roberto
03:02:10.171 Duran was a straight up savage who was
03:02:11.971 sponsored by a cigarette company look at
03:02:13.980 that he's got a cigarette company logo
03:02:15.661 on its back that was a cigarette company
03:02:17.881 wasn't it looks like my bro I think he
03:02:20.611 had a cigarette company sponsor him well
03:02:23.011 either way maybe maybe it was just a
03:02:24.900 design he was a monster and he just
03:02:28.411 jumped on top of Sugar Ray Leonard
03:02:30.870 wouldn't let him breathe and sugar a
03:02:32.490 decided to try to fight his fight
03:02:34.230 squirt up to the fight squirt up a
03:02:36.180 little to fight Sugar Ray just decided
03:02:37.680 to try to engage him like up close like
03:02:40.740 this so they fought these kind of fights
03:02:42.210 like this in the clinch total [ __ ]
03:02:45.150 chaos kind of fighting which favors
03:02:47.130 Duran you know Duran was just a lovely
03:02:50.330 animal love that [ __ ]
03:02:52.980 so but see how he's wrestling with him

03:02:56.640 pushing him against the ring staying in
03:02:58.320 his face he's not giving him any chance
03:03:00.271 to move and in the rematch
03:03:03.140 obviously Sugar Ray fought a totally
03:03:05.101 different fight and got Roberto Duran to
03:03:06.780 quit but it was an amazing fight and
03:03:11.300 historically like one of the greatest
03:03:13.380 boxing matches ever just chaos as Sugar
03:03:16.830 Ray Leonard taking a chance and you know
