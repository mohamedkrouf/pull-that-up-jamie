00:00:01.199 makes it look like we're on a radio show
00:00:02.879 yeah
00:00:07.359 check it out the joe rogan experience
00:00:10.480 train by day joe rogan podcast by night
00:00:13.360 all day
00:00:16.640 yes ladies and gentlemen welcome back
00:00:19.359 randall carlson how are you sarah
00:00:20.880 i'm doing well joe you freaked out the
00:00:22.960 entire uh podcast population the last
00:00:25.519 time you were here with your stories of
00:00:27.439 cataclysmic disasters and
00:00:30.320 and uh the uh ramifications of
00:00:33.040 asteroidal impacts and
00:00:34.800 just the just the the evidence that you
00:00:37.200 presented was a real
00:00:38.239 uh mind [ __ ] as it were
00:00:42.239 well uh what can i say well
00:00:45.440 i apologize to all the listeners out
00:00:47.360 there that um might have had nightmares
00:00:49.760 no worries i knew that was going to be
00:00:51.600 the case though i knew
00:00:52.800 after the first time i met you we had
00:00:55.280 that long conversation in atlanta
00:00:57.360 i knew uh once you sat down for three
00:01:00.000 hours on a podcast and opened up about
00:01:02.000 that stuff it was really gonna uncork a
00:01:03.840 lot of people's domes
00:01:06.000 well you know ironically there's an
00:01:08.720 upside to the whole thing maybe we'll
00:01:10.240 have time to get into that a little bit
00:01:11.600 today
00:01:12.159 yeah definitely so tell me you just
00:01:14.080 returned from a long excursion with
00:01:16.400 graham hancock
00:01:17.360 if you want to bend that thing like that
00:01:18.880 towards your face or probably work a
00:01:20.240 little
00:01:20.560 yeah there you go like this yeah there
00:01:22.000 you go um you just return from a long
00:01:24.840 excursion with
00:01:26.400 graham hancock you guys were on the road
00:01:28.479 and what was
00:01:29.520 the nature of your trip well we were
00:01:33.040 i was taking graham on a tour showing
00:01:36.079 them some landscapes
00:01:38.640 we would i could call him the landscapes
00:01:40.720 of catastrophe
00:01:42.240 because he's doing his um sequel to
00:01:45.040 fingerprints of the gods
00:01:46.560 and you know when he came out with that
00:01:48.079 book in 1995 he was
00:01:50.159 theorizing that there had been this lost
00:01:52.399 civilization in prehistoric
00:01:54.159 times and you know the critics the
00:01:57.439 the gist of most of what the critics
00:01:59.200 were attacking him on
00:02:00.560 when there were considerable attacks on
00:02:03.119 him as a result of
00:02:04.640 some of the things he put forward in
00:02:06.000 that book was that well if there was
00:02:08.318 this
00:02:09.119 you know great civilization that had
00:02:11.038 existed in you know
00:02:12.400 somewhere back in prehistory where's the
00:02:14.640 evidence of it where
00:02:15.680 where is the where's the pottery you
00:02:17.840 know where are the
00:02:18.800 the carvings where where is the the
00:02:21.200 infrastructure
00:02:22.000 that would have uh existed and
00:02:25.440 you know i don't know if he really had
00:02:26.720 an answer for that other than the fact
00:02:28.720 that you know there had been
00:02:30.080 cataclysmic events that had intervened
00:02:32.239 between then
00:02:33.200 and now but he wasn't really specific
00:02:36.480 about what the nature of those
00:02:37.720 catastrophes
00:02:39.200 actually were um and a lot of additional
00:02:42.080 research has come out since 1995
00:02:45.120 that basically opens the window onto
00:02:48.720 those events that basically separates
00:02:51.519 our modern history
00:02:52.879 which you know the recorded history goes
00:02:55.519 back
00:02:56.000 five or six thousand years um you know
00:02:58.959 when we look at
00:02:59.840 at the emergence of modern civilization
00:03:02.000 we would basically trace it back to nine
00:03:04.080 or ten thousand years ago with the
00:03:05.680 emergence of
00:03:06.959 of um you know agriculture
00:03:10.400 uh the dispersion of languages uh the
00:03:13.040 first cities
00:03:14.080 and so forth when we go beyond that a
00:03:16.800 few thousand years
00:03:18.560 we're in a completely different world
00:03:20.720 and i mean so completely different that
00:03:23.040 it's almost
00:03:23.760 unrecognizable from our modern world
00:03:26.879 if we started recreating maps uh
00:03:30.319 going backwards like taking snapshots of
00:03:32.879 the planet
00:03:33.760 every millennium going back what we
00:03:35.680 would see is that
00:03:36.959 going back to seven or eight thousand
00:03:38.480 years ago the basic configuration of our
00:03:40.720 planet would not change much
00:03:43.040 once we get 11 12 13 000 years ago
00:03:46.319 the changes become profoundly dramatic
00:03:49.200 we start seeing sea levels going down
00:03:51.360 hundreds of feet we see
00:03:53.439 massive ice sheets covering north
00:03:55.120 america and europe and
00:03:56.799 and lots of other enormous changes
00:04:00.480 beyond that is what i consider to be
00:04:03.040 deep history
00:04:04.400 because as we may have talked about in
00:04:06.319 our last interview you know we modern
00:04:08.560 humans have been on this planet for
00:04:10.319 150 to 200 000 years at least
00:04:14.480 you know if we go back say i think the
00:04:16.720 oldest modern human skeleton
00:04:18.880 ever found was named homo adaltu
00:04:23.280 and he dates to about 180 000 years
00:04:26.160 roughly
00:04:27.440 if we think of a generation of humans as
00:04:29.440 25 years
00:04:30.479 that's 7 000 generations of humans right
00:04:34.400 now so the question is is
00:04:37.919 what were we doing for all those
00:04:40.400 thousands of generations until somebody
00:04:42.560 finally
00:04:43.120 realized hey you know what we can plant
00:04:46.000 crops we can
00:04:47.520 you know we can build cities we can form
00:04:49.840 communities
00:04:51.120 you know we can invent language etc etc
00:04:54.840 well my contention is
00:04:57.840 and i think the evidence that's
00:04:59.520 accumulating supports this
00:05:00.960 interpretation that what we're really
00:05:02.800 seeing
00:05:04.000 seven eight nine thousand years ago is
00:05:05.919 not the origins of civilization but the
00:05:08.720 rebooting of civilization
00:05:10.400 you see what i'm saying and when we go
00:05:13.600 back and we realize
00:05:14.800 that modern history is separated from
00:05:18.080 deep history
00:05:19.360 by this extraordinary series of events
00:05:22.479 that transpired between about 11 and 13
00:05:25.039 or 14
00:05:25.759 000 years ago once we begin to recognize
00:05:29.199 how
00:05:29.680 extreme these these events were in
00:05:32.800 remodeling our planet totally remodeling
00:05:35.199 our planet
00:05:36.240 it then becomes obvious to us why there
00:05:38.560 is not a lot of hard evidence for
00:05:41.440 whatever went on prior to these to these
00:05:44.800 events
00:05:45.759 and there's been some things that
00:05:47.120 they've found since then that have
00:05:48.639 really sort of
00:05:50.320 made graham hancock's theories become
00:05:52.800 more and more palatable to even
00:05:54.400 mainstream scientists
00:05:55.680 yes like go beckley tapping exactly
00:05:58.479 exactly go beckley tepe
00:05:59.919 uh gunang pedang these are apparently
00:06:03.520 uh structures that were built at least
00:06:05.600 11 or 12 000 years ago
00:06:08.160 and i'm waiting to find out the um the
00:06:11.280 most recent
00:06:12.080 uh ideas on them i think that probably
00:06:14.319 they go back much older than that um
00:06:16.880 because from what graham told me they're
00:06:19.199 just only in the preliminary stages of
00:06:20.880 being excavated
00:06:22.000 so yeah i believe quebec tempe is less
00:06:23.840 than 10 percent excavated right
00:06:25.919 yeah yeah so this is this enormous ruin
00:06:28.800 that appears to be
00:06:30.080 you know late pleistocene ice age
00:06:33.360 in india in age that apparently was
00:06:36.479 deliberately buried
00:06:38.000 um which is interesting brings up a very
00:06:40.560 interesting
00:06:41.280 issue why would they deliberately bury
00:06:43.840 it and they know it's delivery
00:06:45.280 deliberately buried because of the
00:06:46.720 uniformity of the age of the dirt is
00:06:48.479 that what it is
00:06:49.039 i questioned graham on that because i
00:06:50.880 wanted to know if it was
00:06:52.160 because the first thing i thought to
00:06:53.360 myself was it could be natural
00:06:55.599 because i have seen so many sedimentary
00:06:58.240 deposits caused by great floods
00:07:00.960 graham assured me that that it was um
00:07:04.560 that it was human that that it was
00:07:06.479 deliberate it was not
00:07:07.680 because if it had been buried by floods
00:07:09.840 or water there should be internal
00:07:11.199 stratification it would be very
00:07:12.880 obvious um i've been giving it some
00:07:15.919 thought
00:07:16.319 and and you know what occurred to me was
00:07:18.080 this and and i um
00:07:19.919 ran this by graham but i i haven't
00:07:21.680 gotten a
00:07:22.960 response from him on this but i started
00:07:24.960 thinking if it was deliberately buried
00:07:27.199 why would they bury it then i begin
00:07:29.759 thinking
00:07:30.319 what we talked about last time when we
00:07:31.840 were talking about the tunguska event in
00:07:33.520 siberia when you had this massive aerial
00:07:36.000 detonation
00:07:37.280 you know that was about a 15 megaton
00:07:39.440 explosion okay now that's
00:07:41.120 equivalent to our biggest hydrogen bombs
00:07:44.400 that used to be in the american arsenal
00:07:46.160 and it's just because of an asteroid
00:07:47.599 that that blew up in our atmosphere
00:07:49.520 about a
00:07:49.919 150 foot diameter asteroid which is not
00:07:52.720 that big
00:07:53.360 really relative in the cosmic scale of
00:07:55.360 things
00:07:57.039 the the the point though is it was
00:07:58.720 moving really really fast
00:08:00.319 you know is moving you know a rifle
00:08:02.720 bullet let's say on average is about
00:08:04.400 a thousand feet per second right a an
00:08:07.039 asteroid coming into the atmosphere is
00:08:08.960 going to be 20 or 30 times
00:08:11.440 that velocity so it carries an enormous
00:08:14.639 kinetic punch when it hits the
00:08:16.160 atmosphere
00:08:17.199 it explodes because of the fact that
00:08:21.039 the earth is not actually absorbing a
00:08:23.280 lot of that
00:08:24.080 energy it's dispersed widely through the
00:08:26.319 atmosphere
00:08:27.520 now think about this particularly during
00:08:29.919 the height of the cold war
00:08:31.599 in order to protect our missile silos
00:08:34.719 our super hardened command and control
00:08:36.719 centers what did we do with them
00:08:38.719 put them on the ground put them
00:08:39.760 underground we buried them exactly
00:08:42.000 and that began i began to think perhaps
00:08:44.959 could
00:08:45.680 could explain why it was buried in order
00:08:48.080 to preserve it
00:08:49.200 um against the possibility of of
00:08:52.560 some kind of an aerial burst or or you
00:08:55.200 know some kind of a
00:08:56.080 a highly energetic event that seems
00:08:59.200 a weird thing for 12 000 years ago no i
00:09:01.920 mean what what
00:09:03.200 we have really no evidence whatsoever
00:09:05.279 that anybody is capable of doing
00:09:06.480 anything like that
00:09:07.600 that long ago well as i i think on the
00:09:10.160 contrary i think
00:09:11.279 i think that what we see at the very
00:09:12.880 beginnings of recorded history
00:09:15.200 is an obsession with the sky you know
00:09:17.600 that's one of the points that graham
00:09:18.800 brings out in his work you know is that
00:09:21.200 that humans
00:09:22.160 our ancestors of of 10 12 13 000 even
00:09:25.440 you know
00:09:25.920 much sooner than that had had a um just
00:09:28.800 an obsessive concern with events in the
00:09:30.640 sky and
00:09:31.440 you know all of these ancient structures
00:09:33.680 whether we're talking about stonehenge
00:09:35.360 and i'm sure it's going to be the same
00:09:36.720 case with gobekli tepe
00:09:38.560 when we look at these these uh this
00:09:41.040 infrastructure from
00:09:42.480 uh you know like the mesolithic period
00:09:44.800 uh through the neolithic period from you
00:09:46.959 know six
00:09:47.760 five four thousand years ago three
00:09:49.360 thousand years ago what we see is that
00:09:51.680 there's this concern with astronomy
00:09:53.680 you know you the the astronomical
00:09:55.839 alignments that are built into these
00:09:57.200 structures
00:09:58.000 actually allow some pretty sophisticated
00:10:01.040 uh observations of of events happening
00:10:03.680 in the sky
00:10:04.800 and and we can maybe pull up some stuff
00:10:06.800 here that i've brought today to look at
00:10:08.240 that but um
00:10:09.680 yeah i think that um it's highly
00:10:11.440 plausible that people back then could
00:10:13.120 have because
00:10:13.920 think about this again to try to put
00:10:15.760 this in context
00:10:17.200 how many generations ago was the primary
00:10:20.079 mode of human transportation horseback
00:10:23.120 not that many four or five generations
00:10:24.959 ago pretty crazy pretty crazy
00:10:26.880 now think seven thousand generations are
00:10:28.880 you going to tell me then all of that
00:10:30.560 trans all of that time all those
00:10:32.399 generations
00:10:33.760 of humans that have the same presumably
00:10:36.880 intelligence as our own because they've
00:10:38.320 got the same brain size
00:10:40.800 that they're not going to be able to
00:10:42.000 come up with some kind of a
00:10:43.920 a transmitted tradition some type of of
00:10:47.519 um you know the idea of somehow of
00:10:50.079 culture of civilization
00:10:51.680 of language of uh you know that's my
00:10:55.040 point is that there was so much that has
00:10:56.880 been lost and once we understand how
00:11:00.079 dynamic this planet really
00:11:01.920 is it'll become clear to us why we don't
00:11:04.880 have the hard physical
00:11:06.560 record of of things going on 20 or 30
00:11:09.440 000 years ago
00:11:10.320 to put it in perspective for people who
00:11:12.959 have never studied ancient egypt
00:11:15.240 cleopatra the pyramids
00:11:18.320 if you if you look at the date of the
00:11:20.160 pyramids the
00:11:21.440 the cleopatra is closer to us
00:11:24.560 yes than the pyramids were the cleopatra
00:11:27.120 yeah yeah which is
00:11:28.079 nuts it's like you stop and think about
00:11:31.120 that like wait a minute what they was
00:11:32.880 that old back then and they've found
00:11:35.760 these little tiny
00:11:37.360 airplanes inside the pyramids these
00:11:40.240 little
00:11:40.800 little miniature you know carved
00:11:43.360 airplanes
00:11:44.399 that look like airplanes and someone's
00:11:46.399 people have tried to
00:11:47.760 say well no they represent birds that
00:11:50.079 doesn't look like a bird at all i mean
00:11:51.600 they have a rudder
00:11:53.600 and they look like planes well yeah and
00:11:55.519 you know there are traditions
00:11:56.480 particularly the vedic traditions that
00:11:58.079 are full of
00:11:58.880 descriptions of flying objects yes the
00:12:00.959 vimanas yeah exactly
00:12:02.720 so what is that you know i'm not gonna
00:12:05.200 proclaim
00:12:06.160 unequivocally it's it's it's airplanes
00:12:08.560 but at the same time we got to keep an
00:12:10.320 open mind about it and
00:12:11.519 and the point i'm trying to make is that
00:12:12.959 yeah there was so much time that
00:12:14.320 transpired
00:12:15.519 all kinds of things could have happened
00:12:17.279 that that have basically been erased
00:12:19.360 right um and and hopefully by the end of
00:12:21.760 today's
00:12:22.880 interview you'll have a better clear
00:12:24.959 idea of specifically what some of those
00:12:26.959 things really were
00:12:28.000 so we're talking about a potential
00:12:29.680 civilization of maybe
00:12:31.040 tens of thousands of years of growth and
00:12:33.680 if we're looking at what we're
00:12:35.279 what we have from the beginning of the
00:12:37.360 dawn of civilization and we believe
00:12:39.040 mesopotamia somewhere around 7 000 years
00:12:41.200 ago
00:12:42.160 from that till today we're talking about
00:12:44.639 maybe double or triple that
00:12:46.800 was lost in these gigantic cataclysmic
00:12:49.600 events maybe 15
00:12:50.880 20 thousand thirty thousand years of of
00:12:53.760 human beings inventing things
00:12:55.839 people building upon the inventions of
00:12:57.600 others yes expanding
00:12:59.120 and then all of that boom wiped out
00:13:02.560 where rubbing sticks together again to
00:13:04.000 start fires and then whatever
00:13:06.880 memories are left people have to rebuild
00:13:09.600 a generation or two ago
00:13:11.519 it was easy to dismiss ideas like that
00:13:13.360 is fringe science right
00:13:15.200 today as we say here in 2015 it's not
00:13:17.360 nearly so easy to dismiss that anymore
00:13:19.120 particularly what we now know about the
00:13:20.560 history of this planet and how truly
00:13:22.160 dynamic it has been
00:13:23.839 and um that we have in effect been sort
00:13:26.480 of blessed
00:13:27.200 the last six to ten thousand years with
00:13:29.839 a relatively stable climate and i'm
00:13:31.680 going to show you some graphs here
00:13:33.360 that really will blow your mind um that
00:13:36.560 really will
00:13:37.440 will underscore how significant some of
00:13:39.839 these changes have been how profound
00:13:41.279 some of them have been and once we
00:13:42.880 once we know that begin to incorporate
00:13:44.399 that into our thinking we realize we're
00:13:46.399 gonna have to kind of reevaluate our
00:13:48.240 models of of prehistory
00:13:50.240 okay well we have a new setup now so
00:13:52.160 with the tricaster we're gonna allow
00:13:54.320 randall to take control of the situation
00:13:56.079 here if you're just
00:13:57.600 listening to this this might be one of
00:13:59.760 those podcasts where
00:14:01.199 if you're one of those people that
00:14:02.320 listens to it on a commute you might
00:14:03.839 want to go back and
00:14:05.279 check out the uh well vimeo or youtube
00:14:08.320 or
00:14:08.880 those are the ones that ustream is going
00:14:10.480 to give you hd now too right
00:14:12.320 we we do some people don't even know we
00:14:14.240 do a hd video of this podcast as well so
00:14:17.519 what is this uh oxygen isotopes in
00:14:20.079 greenland oxygen isotopes in greenland
00:14:22.320 yeah what we're looking at here
00:14:23.920 this goes back to the early 90s when um
00:14:26.800 you know glaciologists and
00:14:28.839 paleoclimatology
00:14:30.399 guys who study ancient climate extracted
00:14:33.120 these ice cores from the summit of
00:14:34.639 greenland and the reason they went to
00:14:35.920 the summit was because they were looking
00:14:37.279 for the most undistorted ice core record
00:14:39.279 that they could find previous
00:14:40.959 uh ice core extractions had been near
00:14:42.800 the perimeter of the of the ice sheets
00:14:44.720 and
00:14:44.959 and and there the ice flow is is much
00:14:48.000 more dynamic so
00:14:49.519 um there was more distortion in the
00:14:51.360 record so what they did was they went to
00:14:52.720 the very center there was a european
00:14:54.160 team and an american team
00:14:55.920 and without getting into the into the
00:14:57.519 background basically the ice sheet there
00:14:59.440 was almost two miles thick it took
00:15:01.440 five years to drill through it was so
00:15:04.000 miles
00:15:04.720 thick yes yes just think about how far
00:15:07.839 like looking
00:15:09.199 how far two miles away it's like what is
00:15:11.040 a plane a plane's a mile in the air no
00:15:12.880 no
00:15:13.279 well a jet's going to be about 30
00:15:14.800 thousand feet what's a mile 35
00:15:16.959 000 feet a mile no you remember this
00:15:19.279 because it's going to be important
00:15:20.480 number 5
00:15:21.360 280 feet is a mile is a mile right
00:15:24.560 now the tallest building in downtown l.a
00:15:26.720 is probably not
00:15:27.680 over 800 feet thousand feet at the most
00:15:30.320 no
00:15:30.720 um i'm not sure i did look it up at one
00:15:32.560 point what the tallest building was i
00:15:34.000 don't remember what what it was i know
00:15:35.519 the tallest building in atlanta is a
00:15:36.880 thousand and sixty feet
00:15:38.720 and um you know two miles you'd have to
00:15:41.040 think of ten of those stacked on top
00:15:42.480 right each other to get a
00:15:43.600 two mile thick sheet of ice that's
00:15:45.600 that's an amazingly
00:15:47.920 huge mass of ice right right and and
00:15:51.040 and that's pretty much the summit of
00:15:52.959 greenland right and what we're looking
00:15:55.199 at on this
00:15:55.839 on this graph here if you if you go down
00:15:58.320 the left side of the graph
00:16:00.720 this is it's the surface and then down
00:16:03.440 here this 1500 you see right at the
00:16:05.199 bottom that's 1500 meters
00:16:07.199 right 1500 meters you figure there's
00:16:09.519 about 3.28 feet per meter so
00:16:12.079 that's going to be 45 it's going to be
00:16:14.320 yeah close to 5 000. so this is this is
00:16:17.199 1500 meters totally a mile yeah a little
00:16:20.240 less than a mile
00:16:21.440 over here on the right is is the time in
00:16:24.560 thousands of years before the present so
00:16:26.800 as you go down
00:16:27.600 right there there's a thousand years you
00:16:29.519 go down there's two thousand down at the
00:16:31.120 bottom you see ten so that's ten
00:16:32.720 thousand years ago
00:16:34.079 now basically what what the oxygen
00:16:35.920 isotopes do they're a proxy
00:16:37.920 for temperature change adjacent to the
00:16:40.959 ice mass right
00:16:42.240 and if you look at this these are
00:16:43.360 snapshots basically taken like every 10
00:16:46.320 years
00:16:47.199 right and what you see here is that the
00:16:49.360 is the temperature is oscillating back
00:16:51.519 and forth
00:16:52.560 back and forth it's uh two to four
00:16:55.120 degrees
00:16:55.839 centigrade now to put this into context
00:16:58.560 the concern
00:16:59.279 you know we got into this somewhat last
00:17:01.680 time the whole
00:17:02.320 issue of global warming and and i know
00:17:04.240 that in in some of the
00:17:05.439 the feedback we got some of the the most
00:17:07.520 critical comments came from people who
00:17:09.520 didn't like
00:17:10.640 me undermining this whole concept of
00:17:13.280 global warming induced catastrophe right
00:17:15.919 right
00:17:17.039 what we see here though is clearly that
00:17:19.599 the
00:17:20.079 the climate this is the ten thousand
00:17:21.679 years that we're talking about here is
00:17:23.039 called the holocene
00:17:24.079 by geologists it's oscillating back and
00:17:26.720 forth two to four degrees
00:17:28.240 centigrade every every 10 20 30 years
00:17:31.600 right so we're we're talking about a
00:17:34.640 degree
00:17:35.440 that has changed basically in the last
00:17:37.440 century to a century and a half
00:17:39.919 right which which really almost wouldn't
00:17:42.080 even show up here you see
00:17:43.679 but we're going down as we go down we'll
00:17:45.280 see if you go to the right
00:17:47.280 that means temperature is warming as you
00:17:49.360 go to the left it means it's cooling
00:17:51.600 right and so as we go back down this is
00:17:53.840 through the holocene
00:17:54.880 we're going through here and if you look
00:17:56.240 there's some interesting stuff going on
00:17:57.679 right here at about 8
00:17:58.880 200 years ago there's a really there's a
00:18:01.440 spike of cooling right there
00:18:03.760 and that was very very significant
00:18:05.520 cooling i mean that was
00:18:07.039 probably uh caused the
00:18:10.080 glaciers worldwide to start growing
00:18:12.080 again for short for a couple of
00:18:13.440 centuries after they had
00:18:14.799 basically disappeared at the end of the
00:18:16.480 ice age so this was a very um
00:18:19.760 significant event right here and then as
00:18:21.760 we get down right here at ten thousand
00:18:23.120 you see it starts deviating to the left
00:18:24.960 it starts deviating to the cooler
00:18:27.039 i'm going to go to the next slide where
00:18:28.400 we take this graph and we turn it
00:18:30.240 on its side and what i've done here
00:18:33.440 is you see this is this is the present
00:18:36.160 right here
00:18:36.960 and this is basically 10 000 years ago
00:18:39.200 over here on the right side
00:18:41.120 and and i've drawn a level there's a
00:18:42.720 level green line in here to kind of give
00:18:44.559 you a
00:18:45.200 a comparison and you'll notice something
00:18:47.039 here's this 8 200 year ago
00:18:49.520 cold spike right and then as we're going
00:18:52.000 along here
00:18:52.640 you'll notice something that the the
00:18:54.720 general amplitude of these
00:18:56.000 oscillations starts increasing as we get
00:18:58.400 closer to the present can you see that
00:19:00.240 yeah yeah it gets bigger and you'll also
00:19:02.000 notice that that it's dropping
00:19:04.080 it's dropping below that green line it
00:19:06.400 and that means it's cooling
00:19:08.000 so in the last 10 000 years we went from
00:19:10.640 a period of considerable warmth
00:19:12.400 in the in the immediate post-glacial era
00:19:15.440 and then it began to cool off around
00:19:17.919 6000 years ago
00:19:19.520 5 000 years ago and as it began to cool
00:19:21.600 off
00:19:22.640 the temperature oscillations begin to
00:19:24.720 increase in magnitude
00:19:26.400 okay which actually contradicts the
00:19:29.440 computer models that are saying the
00:19:31.919 amplitude of the oscillations is going
00:19:33.600 to increase as the climate gets warmer
00:19:35.600 what we actually see from the greenland
00:19:37.120 ice cores is the opposite of that
00:19:38.880 and it's right here in this graph but
00:19:41.600 what's really significant about this
00:19:43.600 is when we go back beyond 10
00:19:47.039 000 years ago whoa and we see this jesus
00:19:50.480 christ yeah for folks who are listening
00:19:53.440 there's a
00:19:54.320 giant change i mean we're looking at
00:19:57.039 little tiny
00:19:58.400 you know maybe millimeter left right
00:20:00.320 left right left right
00:20:01.440 up until this point now we're looking at
00:20:04.159 huge
00:20:05.360 changes huge changes wow catastrophic
00:20:09.039 changes
00:20:10.000 of temperature yeah and and here we're
00:20:12.640 going back this is look notice this is
00:20:14.240 between uh
00:20:15.200 11 right here roughly 11 600 years ago
00:20:18.640 and about 14 000 years ago look at what
00:20:20.799 happened right here you can see
00:20:23.039 right around 15 000 years ago the
00:20:25.760 climate is is actually if we took this
00:20:27.600 thing out of here you can see there's
00:20:29.120 almost a
00:20:29.840 a trend upwards that gets interrupted
00:20:33.440 right here
00:20:34.480 boom instantly boom overnight jump
00:20:37.280 overnight overnight yeah and in fact
00:20:39.760 um what has happened is if you go back
00:20:42.240 through the literature of of climate
00:20:44.000 change
00:20:44.799 and you read the the estimates of how
00:20:47.600 long it took for the planet to shift
00:20:49.440 modes from
00:20:50.320 full glacial to the interglacial like
00:20:52.080 we're in now
00:20:54.080 50 75 years ago it was a thousand or
00:20:57.120 more years
00:20:57.760 thousands of years when radiocarbon
00:21:00.240 dating came along in the 50s
00:21:02.159 it began to compress and what happened
00:21:05.039 is that if you look in the
00:21:06.400 80s they're talking about perhaps a
00:21:08.720 century several centuries
00:21:10.720 now comes the greenland ice cores and
00:21:12.799 other ice cores and other proxies deep
00:21:14.720 sea
00:21:15.200 cores and so forth and the correlation
00:21:17.600 of all of this evidence
00:21:19.200 and it goes from centuries to decades
00:21:22.159 well
00:21:23.120 as the ability to perceive these changes
00:21:25.919 with ever
00:21:26.799 greater precision and ever greater
00:21:28.720 resolution has evolved
00:21:30.400 it's gotten to now where the change the
00:21:32.880 climate change that took us from glacial
00:21:34.880 to interglacial happened in less than
00:21:36.720 five years
00:21:38.640 and that's what we're seeing right here
00:21:39.840 in this graph what
00:21:41.840 that's what we're seeing so 2010 glacier
00:21:45.320 2015 done ice age over
00:21:48.480 the glacier yeah bear in mind now that
00:21:50.640 there was a considerable lag
00:21:52.159 between the actual the the the
00:21:55.679 manifestation of the glaciers because
00:21:57.520 the glaciers didn't melt that quick
00:21:59.760 right because they're so huge right here
00:22:01.840 that started imagine that we had a
00:22:03.520 big chunk of ice we had an ice sculpture
00:22:06.000 here right
00:22:07.120 and if the temperature is you know 31
00:22:09.840 degrees it's not going to melt
00:22:12.080 if you turn the temperature up to 70
00:22:13.760 degrees right
00:22:15.120 we could turn the temperature up in the
00:22:16.480 matter and it could warm up the room in
00:22:17.919 a matter of
00:22:18.880 hours or minutes but it's going to take
00:22:21.039 a while for that ice sculpture to melt
00:22:22.720 there's going to be a lag
00:22:23.919 right although the change that led to
00:22:26.400 that meltdown was
00:22:27.600 virtually instantaneous you see right so
00:22:30.559 but
00:22:31.440 in that in that period in this interim
00:22:33.840 what we're seeing right here
00:22:35.679 there was an extraordinary right here i
00:22:37.520 think if i go to the next slide i
00:22:40.159 think let's go to the next one
00:22:43.360 yeah i'm going to zoom in here so you
00:22:45.679 can see this
00:22:47.200 there were two massive warming spikes
00:22:50.240 one right here you can see that we're
00:22:51.840 down here in full glacial mode right
00:22:54.080 there
00:22:54.799 and then boom right there there's huge
00:22:56.799 spike of warming now what does that
00:22:58.880 represent when it comes to like
00:23:00.240 temperatures
00:23:01.520 uh that could be on the order of
00:23:04.640 well that would be about 10 to 12
00:23:06.720 degrees centigrade which should be about
00:23:08.320 18 degrees
00:23:09.440 fahrenheit average temperature which is
00:23:12.000 a
00:23:12.559 crazy crazy crazy change because we're
00:23:15.039 scared of two degrees
00:23:16.240 we're scared of two degrees and here
00:23:17.600 we're looking we're scared two two
00:23:19.039 degrees centigrade here we're looking at
00:23:20.640 five
00:23:21.200 six times that much in a matter of a
00:23:24.000 couple of years
00:23:25.440 you see at this point
00:23:28.480 we don't really have an explanation for
00:23:30.159 this that's why i get really frustrated
00:23:32.640 when somebody says to me oh the debate
00:23:34.159 on climate change is over
00:23:36.080 no no no we're we're in the infancy of
00:23:38.640 understanding the climate of this planet
00:23:41.120 and when we look at stuff like this you
00:23:43.200 see um
00:23:44.799 it it really drives home that point and
00:23:46.880 you can see here
00:23:48.000 right i think what people are saying
00:23:49.279 when they're saying that the debate on
00:23:50.640 climate change is over though is whether
00:23:52.080 or not human beings
00:23:53.279 have had an impact on it in current
00:23:55.120 times no question we have had an
00:23:57.600 impact right now no question of what the
00:23:59.520 debate is right
00:24:01.120 well if you say that the debate is about
00:24:03.039 have humans
00:24:04.240 had an impact or not i think that
00:24:06.559 there's no debate
00:24:07.440 humans have had an impact what they're
00:24:09.279 looking at though in your mind
00:24:10.960 is one aspect of a very
00:24:12.960 multi-dimensional issue yes
00:24:14.799 yes exactly and and
00:24:18.240 my my concern is is that we're going to
00:24:20.400 get so focused
00:24:22.240 on carbon change on carbon chains that
00:24:24.320 we're not looking at
00:24:25.360 any of these other factors isn't that
00:24:27.440 what people do though
00:24:28.720 we concentrate on one aspect of things
00:24:31.520 and it becomes like almost like a
00:24:33.679 cultural meme and then it spreads and
00:24:36.000 this is all people talk about
00:24:37.440 yeah and so many people i guarantee you
00:24:40.640 that we're upset at what you said have
00:24:42.720 not researched climate change at all
00:24:44.799 they just have parroted the words of
00:24:46.640 people that they've heard on television
00:24:48.159 that are experts
00:24:48.880 well you got this well 97 right i agree
00:24:51.919 well if you look into the origin of that
00:24:54.159 um it's pretty contrived it really is i
00:24:57.520 mean how you come up with that and and
00:24:59.679 we could do an hour-long discussion on
00:25:01.440 that and i don't really think
00:25:02.799 we want to get into that today but i i
00:25:05.840 really feel like i should write an
00:25:07.200 analysis of that the source of that 97
00:25:10.320 so-called consensus so that people can
00:25:12.080 really see where it came from
00:25:14.400 in a nutshell basically it goes to three
00:25:17.039 or four pieces of research
00:25:18.400 um some surveys that went out um that
00:25:21.279 were slanted right from the beginning
00:25:22.880 such as
00:25:24.400 do you feel that humans have had an
00:25:26.159 impact on climate
00:25:28.000 yes nobody disagrees with that see you
00:25:30.880 can go through all the whoever these
00:25:32.960 so-called deniers are i have looked and
00:25:35.679 looked who's
00:25:36.400 who's denying is there any climate
00:25:38.880 scientists
00:25:39.679 on any anywhere on the spectrum that
00:25:42.159 denies that the climate changes or that
00:25:44.400 denies that humans have had an influence
00:25:46.240 on the climate
00:25:46.960 and i haven't found a single one so in
00:25:49.120 other words these deniers that you hear
00:25:51.120 about you know the climate change
00:25:52.480 deniers
00:25:53.600 they don't really exist there are those
00:25:55.520 who criticize
00:25:56.640 the consensus view right that the
00:25:58.880 dominant mode of climate change is being
00:26:00.480 induced by humans
00:26:02.559 and they are being shoved into this camp
00:26:04.400 of climate change deniers but they're
00:26:06.320 not
00:26:06.880 they're absolutely not climate change
00:26:08.480 deniers and when you look at stuff like
00:26:11.120 this
00:26:11.600 you know a lot of these guys who would
00:26:13.039 question the so-called anthropogenic
00:26:14.960 climate change consensus
00:26:16.799 are guys who've done this work now this
00:26:18.720 work is how old
00:26:20.240 well let's go this goes to the uh this
00:26:22.799 goes back to the to these
00:26:24.480 the this work that i'm showing you here
00:26:26.320 was published in 93.
00:26:28.080 the the the the um the greenland ice
00:26:31.120 sheet project
00:26:32.080 and the um the greenland ice sheet
00:26:34.880 project
00:26:35.440 into greenland i forget it was grip and
00:26:39.039 jisp
00:26:39.760 the two uh it was a european and an
00:26:42.080 american team they spent five years
00:26:43.679 drilling
00:26:44.480 so these are the most accurate proxies
00:26:46.480 we have at in hand
00:26:48.080 and they're pulling tubes of ice is that
00:26:49.840 yeah like a cylinder yeah like cylinders
00:26:52.159 picture maybe six inches in diameter
00:26:54.320 so you have like a circular cutting
00:26:56.080 thing they have a circular cutting drill
00:26:58.159 that extracts these ice cores
00:27:00.400 and for the last 20 years they've been
00:27:02.720 analyzing the ice core you know it took
00:27:04.720 five years to get them out and it's been
00:27:06.559 you know 20 years now of analyzing what
00:27:09.600 they're telling us
00:27:10.480 so before they had all these ice cores
00:27:12.799 when they were saying that this
00:27:14.080 climate change took thousands of years
00:27:15.679 was that just guessing
00:27:17.200 pretty much based that was based upon
00:27:20.480 actual empirical observations of
00:27:24.000 ice glaciers receding as a result
00:27:27.360 of the modern warming because you have
00:27:30.080 to understand
00:27:31.600 up until about the middle of the 19th
00:27:33.279 century we were in the middle
00:27:34.880 of what was has commonly been referred
00:27:36.960 to as the little ice age
00:27:39.120 and and this is another thing that's
00:27:40.880 important to put into context
00:27:42.960 the ice the little ice age was in two
00:27:45.679 phases the earliest phase came on in
00:27:48.080 about the mid 1300s
00:27:50.159 then it warmed for about a century in
00:27:52.320 the 15 1600s and then the second phase
00:27:55.039 came on
00:27:56.159 during that time the glaciers worldwide
00:27:58.480 began to grow
00:27:59.600 and most of the evidence today suggests
00:28:01.679 that during the little ice age glaciers
00:28:03.919 were bigger than they had been
00:28:05.520 in 10 000 years so around the middle of
00:28:09.360 the 19th century around 1850 give or
00:28:12.000 take a decade or two
00:28:13.840 the climate began to warm out of the
00:28:16.000 little ice age and glaciers began to
00:28:17.919 recede
00:28:19.039 right now if we look at glacier
00:28:20.960 recession that's going on right now and
00:28:23.039 it's been going on for the last 10 or 20
00:28:24.960 years
00:28:25.840 what we see is it's basically a
00:28:27.360 continuation of the recession that's
00:28:29.840 been going on
00:28:30.799 for 160 or 170 years
00:28:34.080 right so it's important to establish
00:28:37.279 what's our baseline when we're comparing
00:28:39.520 modern recession of glaciers
00:28:41.760 bear in mind that our baseline is we're
00:28:44.000 starting from the glaciers being bigger
00:28:46.320 than they had been in 10 000 years right
00:28:49.679 so the i think then we have to
00:28:52.799 understand that that that little ice
00:28:54.480 agent in fact had some pretty serious
00:28:56.320 consequences for civilization
00:28:58.159 um we can see that there were two
00:29:00.640 periods in the last 2000 years there
00:29:02.320 were two periods
00:29:03.279 of global cooling one of them occurred
00:29:06.799 in the sixth century
00:29:08.000 uh it actually now can be accurately
00:29:10.080 dated to
00:29:11.360 occurring between 536 and 544 a.d
00:29:15.840 which is a very interesting time this
00:29:17.600 was basically the time that historians
00:29:20.000 have have for
00:29:20.960 for decades said this was the onset of
00:29:23.600 the dark ages
00:29:25.120 it's also the time during which all of
00:29:27.520 the arthurian myths and the grail quest
00:29:30.159 stories are placed you know arthur
00:29:32.799 arthur's desk
00:29:34.080 death is is traditionally placed at the
00:29:36.640 battle of cam land
00:29:37.919 or kamlon which is usually dated at
00:29:40.240 about 540
00:29:41.600 a.d which which basically culminated
00:29:44.399 this
00:29:44.720 quest for the grail right what was the
00:29:48.000 now the grail stories themselves were
00:29:50.799 set down in writing
00:29:52.320 uh between about 1180 and 12 30 a.d
00:29:55.600 in this really interesting time during
00:29:57.919 the middle ages at the same time that
00:29:59.760 the
00:30:00.399 great cathedrals were being built um
00:30:03.440 when the cathar movement was at its
00:30:05.200 strongest when the night
00:30:06.559 knights of the temple were at their
00:30:08.320 strongest
00:30:09.919 when kabulism schools were flourishing
00:30:12.640 in spain when the troubadours were
00:30:15.039 making their their circuits around
00:30:16.799 europe uh you know
00:30:18.399 spreading news and entertainment but
00:30:20.399 really probably
00:30:21.760 carrying uh esoteric information to the
00:30:24.880 initiates that had the key
00:30:27.039 to the to the secret language that they
00:30:29.120 used it was very interesting time
00:30:31.279 but it was in that 1280 to 1180 to 1230
00:30:34.559 that the
00:30:35.520 uh that the grail stories were written
00:30:37.360 down now the grail stories actually
00:30:39.679 refer back to this period
00:30:41.840 of the arthurian days and the quest for
00:30:45.120 the grail if you recall was that the
00:30:47.200 that the land had uh succumbed to blight
00:30:50.799 it had become a wasteland england had
00:30:53.600 become a wasteland
00:30:55.200 and the idea of the grail was it was the
00:30:58.240 grail
00:30:59.279 not only restored the wasteland it
00:31:02.480 restored the king because remember the
00:31:04.080 king whether it was king arthur or braun
00:31:06.720 or on fortas or the fisher king
00:31:10.080 there were different names in different
00:31:11.279 stories it was the same deal
00:31:13.200 he was sick he was in decline he was
00:31:15.279 wounded the wound wouldn't heal
00:31:17.039 um he was debilitated and the only way
00:31:20.240 to restore him was to find the grail
00:31:22.399 bring the grail back allow him to drink
00:31:24.960 from the grail but the
00:31:26.000 the grail was also the means of
00:31:27.760 restoring the wasteland to fertility in
00:31:30.640 in
00:31:32.720 now here's where it gets interesting is
00:31:35.039 that the dendrochronologists
00:31:37.519 who who study tree rings have been
00:31:39.840 looking at that period
00:31:41.440 exactly in that period that the the
00:31:44.399 tradition places the the
00:31:46.240 grail quest and have discovered that for
00:31:48.559 about eight or ten years
00:31:50.080 forest growth in the northern hemisphere
00:31:51.919 almost came to a screeching halt
00:31:54.000 and this has now been well documented uh
00:31:56.080 mike bailey has has done most of this
00:31:58.240 work
00:31:59.840 basically showing that there was a a
00:32:02.399 serious global cooling that took place
00:32:04.640 during those years um and the historical
00:32:07.760 record of that seems to confirm because
00:32:09.679 there's
00:32:10.320 multiple descriptions uh you know from
00:32:12.720 irish monks and so on
00:32:14.320 describing how for weeks at a time the
00:32:16.559 sun is not visible
00:32:17.760 um that you know that its darkness has
00:32:20.000 come over the land that there were
00:32:21.440 reports of these mysterious fogs and
00:32:24.080 then there are multiple collapses of
00:32:26.960 agriculture
00:32:28.559 okay so as a result of these
00:32:31.600 multi-year collapses of agriculture
00:32:33.600 because of the cold and the dark and the
00:32:35.440 damp
00:32:36.960 people got malnourished and then you had
00:32:39.039 famine
00:32:40.240 as a result of famine people their
00:32:43.120 immune systems became
00:32:44.480 weakened and then in 542 a.d
00:32:47.600 you had the onset of the justinian
00:32:49.360 plague which wiped out
00:32:51.120 maybe a third of the population of
00:32:52.720 europe whole whole villages disappeared
00:32:55.279 as a consequence
00:32:56.799 now these events pretty much followed in
00:32:59.679 sequence
00:33:00.320 you see the cold brought about the
00:33:03.519 collapse of agriculture the collapse of
00:33:05.200 agriculture brought about famine famine
00:33:07.120 brought about weakness
00:33:08.720 and as a result boom you have plague
00:33:12.159 now it took european civilization nearly
00:33:15.519 three centuries to recover from that
00:33:18.159 now what brought about the recovery was
00:33:21.120 the return of warmth to the world what
00:33:23.200 is called the medieval warm period
00:33:25.840 and between this began really to occur
00:33:28.320 in about
00:33:28.960 900 a.d this the sea ice
00:33:32.240 began to retract back well inside the
00:33:34.240 arctic circle which opened up the sea
00:33:35.919 lanes between
00:33:36.960 northern europe iceland and greenland
00:33:39.519 and so it was this
00:33:40.320 period of time that the that the the
00:33:42.480 vikings were able to sail
00:33:43.919 to iceland and then sail to greenland
00:33:45.919 and actually establish
00:33:47.440 uh colonies on the west coast of
00:33:49.120 greenland greenland and farm where now
00:33:51.120 the ground is perennially
00:33:52.640 perennially frozen let me try that again
00:33:55.320 perennially
00:33:56.559 frozen right so it was clearly a warm
00:34:00.080 period and what happened was
00:34:01.519 if you look back now at the studies from
00:34:03.360 that medieval warm period you see that
00:34:05.679 agriculture rebounded so many people had
00:34:07.919 lots of food to eat
00:34:10.399 actually studies of skeletons show that
00:34:12.960 the the stature of humans during this
00:34:14.960 period of time
00:34:15.918 increased by four or five inches on
00:34:17.679 average from what it had been
00:34:19.040 during the dark ages and um
00:34:22.159 now europe started becoming wealthy
00:34:23.918 again because the basis of all wealth
00:34:25.679 basically was
00:34:26.480 was agriculture was food right without
00:34:29.119 that not you don't have anything else
00:34:31.119 population began to expand enormously
00:34:33.679 you see other things going on
00:34:36.079 life spans increase infant mortality
00:34:38.879 decreases all of this stuff has been
00:34:40.399 well documented in a whole variety of
00:34:42.239 studies
00:34:43.199 well after about a century and a half of
00:34:46.399 this
00:34:46.960 warmth with the with the uh concomitant
00:34:49.440 wealth that came along
00:34:51.359 european society was wealthy enough to
00:34:54.000 undertake this
00:34:55.040 extraordinary cathedral building phase
00:34:58.240 you see where you had literally hundreds
00:35:00.720 of thousands of highly trained highly
00:35:02.560 skilled craftspeople
00:35:04.240 working on these things you had
00:35:06.960 essentially when you began to look at
00:35:08.240 the cathedral building phenomena
00:35:10.720 it required the basically the
00:35:13.119 mobilization of
00:35:14.560 the whole of european society behind
00:35:16.560 this enterprise
00:35:17.760 because you had to quarry huge amounts
00:35:20.000 of stone you had to transport these
00:35:21.599 stones you had to carve the stones
00:35:23.599 you look at the statuary the stained
00:35:25.839 glass which is
00:35:27.280 exceptional in its in its refractive
00:35:30.079 properties that really have still
00:35:31.839 not been mimicked to this day the way
00:35:33.680 the stained glass was able to refract
00:35:35.680 light so that
00:35:36.720 it gives the appearance of of not the
00:35:39.280 light coming shining through the glass
00:35:41.359 but emanating from within the glass
00:35:43.680 and and you could go on and on with this
00:35:45.760 the the the carpentry skill the
00:35:47.680 engineering skill
00:35:48.880 the astronomy that went into these
00:35:50.800 structures
00:35:52.000 all of this combined basically shows up
00:35:55.520 basically in a historical instant and in
00:35:58.560 what's interesting is the the scarcity
00:36:01.119 of of evidence showing
00:36:04.480 what preceded this how did these
00:36:08.400 who organized this who raised the money
00:36:11.119 who trained the craftsman you know this
00:36:13.119 is
00:36:13.760 there are references that to this in
00:36:16.160 history but really
00:36:17.839 you know there's no explicit detailed
00:36:20.480 discussion where we can go and trace and
00:36:22.160 say okay this is this is how it happened
00:36:24.320 you know but it's important to realize
00:36:27.280 that this was a consequence of the
00:36:29.200 uh of the uh you know the expansion of
00:36:32.720 of
00:36:33.040 of wealth in european society that
00:36:36.079 that was able to allow this to happen
00:36:39.040 and that's as a consequence of the
00:36:40.640 warmth
00:36:41.200 the warmth of the earth and what we see
00:36:43.599 is that
00:36:44.240 the cathedral building era comes to
00:36:47.280 a sudden termination in the early 1300s
00:36:51.200 and if you go and you travel around the
00:36:52.640 cathedrals you'll find that there's in
00:36:54.160 many cases you know
00:36:55.200 the record suggests that it's almost as
00:36:57.200 if
00:36:58.640 in the middle of their work that workmen
00:37:00.079 laid down their tools and left in some
00:37:01.839 cases
00:37:02.320 this is why there were so many
00:37:03.200 cathedrals of the the great ones that
00:37:05.599 weren't finished okay but what you see
00:37:10.160 is that exactly concurring
00:37:13.200 with the cessation of cathedral building
00:37:15.280 within a within a few decades anyway
00:37:18.079 was the onset to the little ice age and
00:37:20.720 the return of the cold
00:37:22.400 in this first phase of the little ice
00:37:24.240 age uh again brought about
00:37:26.320 agricultural collapses it brought about
00:37:28.320 famine and then you had the black plague
00:37:30.640 that showed up i think around what was
00:37:32.480 it 1330 1340
00:37:34.240 right in there again decimated the
00:37:37.280 the civilization of europe so you can
00:37:39.920 see i mean
00:37:41.680 if we look at the historical record what
00:37:43.680 we see is the times of
00:37:45.680 of global warming have actually been
00:37:48.240 times of
00:37:49.599 advancement in civilization now of
00:37:52.000 course that
00:37:52.880 that would have its limit i mean we
00:37:54.320 could get to you know at some point
00:37:56.160 where we would get
00:37:56.960 too warm but so far what we've seen
00:38:00.079 we're
00:38:00.800 at this point well within the range of
00:38:02.480 natural variability that's the
00:38:04.320 why is this never brought up by anybody
00:38:06.720 but you i've never heard anybody else
00:38:08.960 discuss
00:38:10.320 this this very controversial subject
00:38:13.200 it's controversial because everyone's so
00:38:14.720 fixated on
00:38:15.760 global warming being about it's it's
00:38:17.680 there it's there for anybody who is
00:38:19.599 willing to do their homework
00:38:21.200 you know and if somebody uh goes on my
00:38:23.680 website or whatever and says
00:38:25.520 what are your sources i'm glad to
00:38:26.960 provide multiple multiple sources
00:38:29.359 going back i've been i've been
00:38:30.800 collecting this data for decades you
00:38:32.560 know and it's there
00:38:33.680 and i have to ask the same question why
00:38:35.839 are we ignoring
00:38:36.880 this evidence you know why are we well
00:38:39.119 the i think we're ignoring it because
00:38:41.200 climate change has become a
00:38:43.280 political agenda rather than a
00:38:46.079 scientific question
00:38:47.760 you know and so because there are
00:38:49.599 political factions that are lined up
00:38:51.280 behind it
00:38:52.400 um you know the inter intergovernmental
00:38:56.079 panel on climate change is now looked at
00:38:58.000 as as being the
00:38:59.359 the ultimate source for data on the on
00:39:01.440 the climate
00:39:02.960 and bear in mind they were created by
00:39:05.359 the united nations framework convention
00:39:07.119 on climate change and given the mandate
00:39:08.800 of go out there and demonstrate that
00:39:10.000 humans are causing climate change so
00:39:11.520 right from the very start that was their
00:39:13.040 mission
00:39:14.000 and they were not told go and look for
00:39:16.160 natural causes of natural climate
00:39:18.079 variability
00:39:19.280 study the human and it's important i'm
00:39:22.000 not at all saying it's not important for
00:39:23.839 us to
00:39:24.640 study our own effects on climate
00:39:27.680 but it's going to be dangerous i think
00:39:30.000 if if we neglect
00:39:31.680 you know what we're seeing right here on
00:39:33.200 these graphs of this graph that i'm
00:39:34.800 showing you because that's clearly not
00:39:36.240 carbon dioxide see
00:39:38.079 if we're told and we have been
00:39:39.280 repeatedly told that carbon dioxide
00:39:41.440 concentrations in the atmosphere held
00:39:43.280 relatively steady at about 280 parts per
00:39:46.160 million
00:39:47.440 right prior to the industrial revolution
00:39:49.680 and only
00:39:50.640 subsequent to the industrial revolution
00:39:53.200 did carbon dioxide start going up
00:39:55.520 well if we assume just for the sake of
00:39:57.839 argument that that's correct
00:40:00.079 well look at this graph what we're
00:40:02.480 saying is that if carbon dioxide held
00:40:04.319 steady at 280 parts per million going
00:40:06.400 back hundreds of thousands of years
00:40:08.319 as al gore has actually stated and as
00:40:10.400 many others have stated
00:40:12.640 it's not carbon dioxide driving those
00:40:14.480 climate changes is it
00:40:15.920 well it can't be that it can't be no if
00:40:17.680 that's the case and that's hard science
00:40:19.680 this is hard science here it is right
00:40:21.200 now it's hard science as well
00:40:22.720 you're looking at something really crazy
00:40:24.800 some event
00:40:25.839 yeah yeah that's my point now the
00:40:28.880 alternative is okay are we saying if
00:40:31.520 if carbon dioxide is the dominant driver
00:40:34.240 of climate change
00:40:35.680 and that's what we're seeing here then
00:40:39.280 what that basically says is that there's
00:40:41.040 some gigantic unknown reservoirs of co2
00:40:45.280 that have outgassed into the atmosphere
00:40:47.359 which again undermines the so-called
00:40:49.359 consensus view because
00:40:51.040 so far the consensus view consensus view
00:40:53.520 states that
00:40:54.319 the client that co2 is only increased
00:40:56.480 because of burning fossil fuel
00:40:59.040 so this graph is the real inconvenient
00:41:01.599 truth
00:41:02.319 this graph that's well put yes this
00:41:05.280 graph
00:41:05.760 is the real inconvenient truth and when
00:41:07.599 we look at some of this i mean
00:41:09.359 right there that is a major global
00:41:11.680 warming right there
00:41:12.960 because this dashed line represents the
00:41:15.040 modern temperature
00:41:16.640 like the 20th century average is this
00:41:18.960 dashed line
00:41:19.760 that dashed line but what year are we
00:41:21.920 looking at right there
00:41:22.960 right here this is between 100 and 150
00:41:25.680 000 years ago
00:41:26.640 and that's a giant jump that's a giant
00:41:29.359 jump
00:41:29.760 i mean so what what does that represent
00:41:31.359 as far as degrees and temperature
00:41:33.119 oh well let's see that's probably going
00:41:34.960 to be you know 15 to 18 degrees
00:41:36.960 fahrenheit
00:41:37.599 whoa yeah right there so that's you know
00:41:39.680 again 15 to 18 times greater than the
00:41:43.280 than the presumed temperature increase
00:41:46.240 of the last century
00:41:47.680 is there any mainstream i shouldn't say
00:41:49.760 mainstream scientific explanation for
00:41:52.319 what that is no well it's called the
00:41:55.440 eemian
00:41:56.240 it's called the eemian period it's an
00:41:57.680 interglacial period but even within the
00:41:59.599 interglacial period you see that there
00:42:01.040 are these
00:42:01.680 massive oscillations massive cooling
00:42:04.560 coolant
00:42:05.359 warming again yeah and so there's a
00:42:07.520 variability
00:42:08.640 if you're saying the warming is between
00:42:10.400 it's 18 degrees is that what you said
00:42:12.640 up to that so the cooling you're talking
00:42:14.880 about almost
00:42:16.160 that much in the other direction in the
00:42:17.839 other direction yeah and
00:42:19.440 you're talking about this over a period
00:42:20.880 of just a few decades well
00:42:22.960 as we get back this far we don't have
00:42:24.560 the same degree of precision as we do
00:42:26.640 when we're we're here um perhaps yes
00:42:30.000 but we're not sure but we do know that
00:42:32.800 these
00:42:33.680 changes that we're looking at here that
00:42:35.680 terminated the last ice age
00:42:37.680 were just in a matter of a few years
00:42:39.520 yeah for sure
00:42:41.119 and the instantaneous nature of those
00:42:45.040 is what you focus on when you start
00:42:47.280 talking about
00:42:48.079 asteroidal impacts and things along
00:42:50.079 those lines that that
00:42:51.119 is something that we can explain that's
00:42:53.839 something you can point to
00:42:55.440 by default there doesn't seem to be a
00:42:58.160 lot of
00:42:58.640 other things that we can invoke to
00:43:00.640 explain what we're seeing right here
00:43:02.640 and there's absolute evidence that we
00:43:05.040 have been hit
00:43:06.160 multiple times we're going to get into
00:43:08.160 that yes yes
00:43:09.760 and and that's a big part of what what
00:43:11.839 graham's book is
00:43:12.800 this is amazing when you look at the
00:43:14.319 ancient history i mean it's not even
00:43:16.160 ancient as far as i mean they were human
00:43:17.760 beings living
00:43:19.119 sort of like us oh yeah but how much
00:43:21.280 different the
00:43:22.640 climate was like it was so [ __ ] up
00:43:25.760 well i'm not sure about the west coast
00:43:27.520 but i know on the east coast
00:43:29.359 there were you know swarms of icebergs
00:43:32.079 stranding like off the coast of south
00:43:33.920 carolina
00:43:34.960 for example you know there was no great
00:43:37.440 lakes
00:43:38.160 because the great lakes were under
00:43:39.440 thousands of feet of ice you know new
00:43:41.359 york
00:43:42.319 boston detroit um seattle
00:43:45.920 portland or not so portland but seattle
00:43:49.119 twin cities chicago all of these areas
00:43:52.000 were under thousands of feet of ice
00:43:54.720 thousands of people and we're not
00:43:55.760 talking millions of years ago we're
00:43:57.280 talking
00:43:57.920 you know 12 13 000 to
00:44:01.040 25 to 30 000 years ago that's incredible
00:44:04.079 it is and in sea levels we're basically
00:44:07.040 in round numbers 400 feet lower
00:44:09.440 than now which essentially exposes the
00:44:12.480 entire
00:44:13.359 cotton most of the continental shelves
00:44:15.040 and i'm going to i've got some some
00:44:16.480 interesting graphics here to show you
00:44:18.960 uh what what continental coastlines
00:44:21.359 would have looked like
00:44:22.319 there was an article that i was reading
00:44:23.680 recently about aborigines and aboriginal
00:44:26.160 tales
00:44:26.800 of uh of the lowered
00:44:29.920 like lowered sea levels yeah that
00:44:32.160 they're starting to correspond now with
00:44:33.839 actual climate data and
00:44:35.200 understanding of what the sea levels
00:44:36.640 actually were at that time these are
00:44:38.319 stories that are supposedly 10 000 years
00:44:40.400 old passed through oral traditions
00:44:42.160 these traditions to me are just
00:44:45.680 beyond valuable you know up until very
00:44:48.960 recently
00:44:50.000 they have been considered basically just
00:44:52.400 you know
00:44:53.119 interesting in the in the in the
00:44:55.200 anthropological or psychological sense
00:44:57.359 but had no real
00:44:58.960 hard scientific um credibility to them
00:45:03.839 now i think we're beginning to
00:45:05.280 reevaluate them there's a an
00:45:07.200 archaeologist
00:45:08.319 archaeologist by the name of bruce
00:45:09.680 massey who's been doing some very
00:45:11.280 interesting work
00:45:12.480 in for the last 20 years analyzing
00:45:16.560 many of these ancient myths and
00:45:18.560 realizing and and putting
00:45:20.480 out there the argument that these that
00:45:23.040 these myths and these legends and these
00:45:24.880 epic tales
00:45:26.079 uh encode really hard scientific
00:45:29.440 information
00:45:30.400 that we can extract from them and um
00:45:32.880 talking about global changes
00:45:34.400 and astronomical events and so forth and
00:45:36.960 and
00:45:37.599 um so and i've been a believer in that
00:45:40.160 for a long time you know and this is
00:45:42.000 you know one of the premises of graham's
00:45:44.400 work is that
00:45:45.680 that the myths and the legends actually
00:45:48.079 have a great deal to teach us beyond
00:45:50.160 just
00:45:50.720 the psychological orientation of our
00:45:52.800 ignorant pre-scientific
00:45:54.480 ancestors you know but yeah you the good
00:45:57.359 point you make there
00:45:58.880 um when we look at this graph basically
00:46:00.960 what we're seeing here is that coming
00:46:02.240 out of the ice age you can kind of see
00:46:04.160 that we're coming up here and then we
00:46:06.720 have this
00:46:07.280 first massive spike of warming and then
00:46:09.680 it seesaws back down into this full
00:46:12.319 glacial cold
00:46:13.440 this is called this period between these
00:46:15.520 two green arrows is called the younger
00:46:17.920 dryas
00:46:19.280 which is named after a polar wildflower
00:46:21.440 that had disappeared
00:46:22.800 in northern europe and then suddenly
00:46:24.880 came back again it only grows in polar
00:46:26.839 environments dries octopatella
00:46:29.680 so the younger driest compared because
00:46:32.319 there was an older driest too
00:46:34.160 but it lasted now the dates are placing
00:46:36.560 it from roughly 12
00:46:38.160 900 years ago give or take a few decades
00:46:40.720 to 11
00:46:41.839 600 years ago so this
00:46:45.280 spike of warming right here is 11 600
00:46:48.319 years
00:46:49.040 now if we look at the next one here this
00:46:52.160 graph
00:46:52.880 basically goes to a different realm of
00:46:55.839 evidence
00:46:56.800 and what this shows is the average the
00:46:59.520 rate
00:47:00.000 of sea level rise you see
00:47:03.359 now oceanographers and marine geologists
00:47:06.240 have have been studying
00:47:07.520 there's there's a number of different
00:47:09.119 ways they can correlate this information
00:47:10.880 they can look at actual evidence of
00:47:12.720 submerged shorelines right they can look
00:47:15.280 at at changes in the
00:47:16.800 in the flora and the fauna that have
00:47:18.800 that have lived in the oceans
00:47:20.480 they can look at coral reefs there's a
00:47:23.200 lot of different things
00:47:24.000 that they can pull together to see
00:47:27.040 how rapidly sea levels rose at the end
00:47:29.280 of the last ice age
00:47:30.880 and again a generation or two ago the
00:47:33.839 assumption was
00:47:34.720 that there was a smooth continuum of
00:47:36.640 rise that took tens of thousands of
00:47:38.640 years
00:47:39.200 right to get us from minus 400 feet up
00:47:42.640 to what we are now at the present level
00:47:44.960 what this graph shows is that there were
00:47:46.960 two massive spikes of
00:47:48.880 melt water introduced into the oceans
00:47:50.880 into the global oceans at the end of the
00:47:52.480 last ice age
00:47:53.680 and you can see the first spike called
00:47:56.800 melt water pulse 1a
00:47:58.559 is the biggest followed by another one
00:48:00.720 meltwater pulse 1b
00:48:02.960 if we go back to this graph right here
00:48:06.480 those two spikes of glacial melt water
00:48:09.200 and sea level rise coincide with this
00:48:11.040 warming spike and that warming spike and
00:48:12.960 you can see
00:48:13.839 how this warming spike seems to be the
00:48:15.839 most intense
00:48:17.599 followed by this one and we see that
00:48:19.839 meltwater pulse 1a
00:48:21.280 is the biggest so what this is showing
00:48:24.160 is that the
00:48:24.880 the rise in sea level was not as smooth
00:48:27.760 it was like
00:48:28.640 whoop and then womp again so there was
00:48:30.960 something that caused all those glaciers
00:48:33.040 to melt within
00:48:34.079 just a very short amount of time
00:48:35.920 geologically speaking yes a geological
00:48:38.079 instant
00:48:38.800 exactly what's further interesting is
00:48:41.760 when we look at this graph
00:48:43.680 this is the late pleistocene mortality
00:48:46.000 graph
00:48:46.720 in each square represents a fossil
00:48:49.839 specimen
00:48:50.640 of an extinct mammal you know could be a
00:48:53.839 woolly mammoth
00:48:55.040 could be a giant ground sloth could be a
00:48:56.960 saber-toothed cat could be the giant
00:48:58.960 cave bear
00:49:00.720 roughly 120 species of
00:49:03.760 mega mammals that lived during the ice
00:49:06.079 age
00:49:07.119 went extinct right at the end of the ice
00:49:09.680 age and basically
00:49:11.040 what this graph is showing us here is
00:49:13.280 that
00:49:14.480 you probably can't read this here so
00:49:16.480 i'll interpret it for you if you go back
00:49:18.400 to here
00:49:19.200 the left side represents 50 000 years
00:49:21.440 ago
00:49:22.480 and here where where the cursor is
00:49:24.960 that's 40 000 years
00:49:26.880 30 000 20 000 and you see that
00:49:30.240 as we're going along here each one of
00:49:32.319 these squares represents the finding
00:49:34.559 of a fossil of an extinct mammal in the
00:49:38.000 in the fossil record what we see from
00:49:40.319 this graph
00:49:41.200 is that when we get to between eleven
00:49:43.440 and thirteen thousand years ago
00:49:45.119 there's a massive spike shoots through
00:49:48.079 the roof
00:49:49.520 this demise of these animals directly
00:49:52.000 coincides
00:49:52.640 directly coincides with this right here
00:49:55.440 directly
00:49:57.440 now what we what we're dealing with is
00:50:00.160 that for 50 years the dominant theory
00:50:03.440 has been is called overkill or
00:50:05.760 blitzkrieg
00:50:06.880 and this theory basically states that
00:50:10.000 bands of paleo-indian hunters came
00:50:12.319 across the bering land bridge
00:50:14.240 slaughtering every animal that they
00:50:16.240 encountered along the way
00:50:18.079 and somehow within less than a thousand
00:50:20.079 years swept from siberia down to tierra
00:50:22.559 del fuego
00:50:23.599 and killed off every woolly every
00:50:25.440 mammoth in the world
00:50:28.000 and presumably every other of the
00:50:29.839 extinct mammals and that has been the
00:50:31.440 dominant theory that
00:50:32.559 that humans caused this mass extinction
00:50:36.880 and personally i think that's just
00:50:39.440 absurd
00:50:40.160 you know because for one thing based
00:50:41.920 upon anthropological studies
00:50:44.160 there were possibly more woolly mammoths
00:50:46.400 in the world and there were people for a
00:50:48.000 while
00:50:48.800 um you know you have to assume that the
00:50:50.800 blitzkrieg was so instantaneous and so
00:50:53.280 all encompassing that there was no time
00:50:56.000 even for the mammoths to
00:50:57.280 to reproduce of course the overkill
00:51:00.640 hypothesis
00:51:01.920 basically addresses itself only to
00:51:03.599 woolly male only to mammoths wooly
00:51:05.359 mammoths were one species of four
00:51:07.119 different species of mammoths
00:51:08.640 but what about the other roughly 120
00:51:10.800 species what about the the giant
00:51:12.559 armadillos and the giant beavers and the
00:51:14.559 american pleistocene lion that was as
00:51:16.400 big
00:51:16.960 big as a horse you know the list goes on
00:51:19.920 and on and on and on and these animals
00:51:22.160 all basically disappeared
00:51:23.920 during this spike that you see right
00:51:25.520 here and that spike falls exactly
00:51:27.680 between these two warming
00:51:29.119 spikes and between the two sea level
00:51:31.119 rises so all the data
00:51:33.760 all points the same time period yes
00:51:36.800 wow and so what i'm saying and this is
00:51:40.559 this is uh you know basically consistent
00:51:43.280 with
00:51:43.839 what what graham's saying in his book is
00:51:45.440 that this this what we're seeing here
00:51:47.359 this episode basically represents a
00:51:49.200 curtain that has come down and obscured
00:51:52.079 150 000 or more years of deep
00:51:55.119 human history and basically has lost
00:51:57.920 that history to modern perception
00:52:00.400 but now once we understand that yeah you
00:52:03.280 know what
00:52:04.160 the uniformitarians were wrong to reject
00:52:07.280 all ideas of catastrophism you know
00:52:09.839 because
00:52:10.319 in the original in the early days of
00:52:12.400 geology the the founding fathers of
00:52:14.559 geology
00:52:15.520 were catastrophists they went out in the
00:52:18.240 field
00:52:18.720 uncovered uncovered unencumbered
00:52:22.000 by dogmas and doctrines and so forth
00:52:25.680 they looked at the evidence in the field
00:52:27.359 and concluded that there had been
00:52:28.880 catastrophic episodes and this is you
00:52:31.040 know baron von cuvier
00:52:33.359 sedgwick murchison if you'd go back and
00:52:35.440 you all of these guys who basically are
00:52:37.200 considered the godfathers of
00:52:39.119 modern geology they were to a man
00:52:41.599 catastrophist
00:52:43.599 uh james hutton uh lyle and
00:52:46.960 playfair came along and basically
00:52:49.599 proposed the idea of uniformitarianism
00:52:52.880 the present is the key to the past very
00:52:55.680 powerful
00:52:56.640 uh working uh idea is that we can look
00:52:59.760 at stuff that's going on today
00:53:01.520 extrapolate backwards and try to figure
00:53:03.359 out things that happened in the past
00:53:05.280 when
00:53:05.760 we don't have a an eyewitness account
00:53:08.000 right
00:53:09.280 very powerful but what what happened was
00:53:11.520 is it it became so entrenched as dogma
00:53:14.400 that anybody who invoked catastrophes
00:53:17.200 was considered
00:53:18.480 um basically fringe because in the early
00:53:21.680 days
00:53:22.240 some of these guys like sedgwick for
00:53:24.160 example he was a theologian he was a
00:53:25.920 traveling minister who went around and
00:53:28.160 in in his travels to you know convert
00:53:30.720 the the
00:53:31.440 the people to to christianity he would
00:53:34.079 see
00:53:34.800 the stuff and he would you know place it
00:53:38.079 within the context perhaps of being
00:53:39.920 noah's flood right and they would place
00:53:42.640 it in
00:53:43.119 some of not all of them some of them
00:53:44.640 would place it in a in a biblical
00:53:46.480 context right
00:53:47.920 so when they were attacked basically the
00:53:51.599 the substance of the attack was well you
00:53:54.480 guys are trying to
00:53:55.440 bring us back to the days of biblical
00:53:57.200 literalism and science has moved beyond
00:53:59.520 that
00:54:00.079 we're not here we don't want to talk
00:54:01.440 about catastrophes or great floods
00:54:04.000 deluges
00:54:04.800 we're through talking about all of that
00:54:06.480 that's all been discredited
00:54:08.160 and what you see is between the early
00:54:10.000 1800s
00:54:11.599 at with the the beginning of geology
00:54:13.760 earth science to about the 19th century
00:54:15.760 what you see is a steady decline
00:54:18.000 you know some of the older guys die off
00:54:19.839 they're replaced by the new guys who
00:54:21.440 have now
00:54:21.839 basically taken control of the
00:54:23.839 university curriculums
00:54:25.440 and they've been indoctrinated into this
00:54:27.119 idea of a strict gradualism
00:54:29.599 and that any deviation from that strict
00:54:31.520 gradualism is is
00:54:32.960 uh heresy basically so by the time we
00:54:36.160 get to the 20th century
00:54:37.440 you had this reigning uniformity
00:54:40.240 reigning gradualist
00:54:41.680 dogma that had been imposed upon all
00:54:44.160 earth science
00:54:45.280 and anybody who deviated from that was
00:54:47.200 immediately kicked out of the club
00:54:49.839 and this is why when j harlan brett's
00:54:51.839 came along in the 1920s and proposed
00:54:54.000 that there had been these gigantic
00:54:55.280 floods in the pacific northwest
00:54:58.000 you know the geological community
00:55:00.319 basically said ah
00:55:01.359 get out of here we don't want to hear
00:55:02.720 about it we know that that couldn't have
00:55:04.720 been
00:55:05.200 uh just because we know jay harlan brett
00:55:08.720 continued to to document
00:55:11.839 uh exhaustively document from the field
00:55:14.319 that that these floods were very real
00:55:17.200 his critics said well you don't you
00:55:19.200 can't provide a source for these floods
00:55:21.119 therefore they didn't happen now bear in
00:55:23.200 mind that all of his critics his
00:55:24.799 his most vocal critics had never even
00:55:27.520 gone out
00:55:28.160 to actually look right and uh
00:55:31.520 graham is going to he has got a great
00:55:33.839 section in his new upcoming book
00:55:35.520 describing
00:55:36.640 that the ordeal that brett's was put
00:55:38.319 through he finally prevailed
00:55:40.400 ultimately um most of his critics died
00:55:43.520 off
00:55:44.079 you know he outlived he lived to be i
00:55:45.440 think 98 so i think when he was 96 he
00:55:48.000 was given the penrose medal which is the
00:55:50.240 uh the highest honor of geology and you
00:55:52.880 know he said he was very grateful but
00:55:54.480 the only thing he
00:55:55.680 was unhappy about was the fact that he
00:55:58.319 all of his critics had died off so he
00:55:59.920 didn't get to gloat
00:56:00.799 over them so but um
00:56:04.400 but so what happened was you had the
00:56:06.240 younger geologists come in who are who
00:56:08.160 are more open to that and and what you
00:56:09.839 see is between the 5th 1950s and 1960s
00:56:12.960 you have a transition going on where
00:56:14.960 where they're
00:56:16.000 beginning to accept that these great
00:56:18.160 floods had happened
00:56:19.520 but but what they did was they took a
00:56:22.400 modern
00:56:23.280 example which is glacial outburst
00:56:26.400 floods which you know we've witnessed
00:56:29.599 dozens and dozens probably hundreds of
00:56:31.520 such cases in iceland particularly
00:56:33.920 alaska british columbia uh the himalayas
00:56:36.799 where you have
00:56:37.839 particularly going back to the little
00:56:39.200 ice age when the glaciers began to
00:56:41.040 recede
00:56:42.000 in the mid-19th century you had a lot of
00:56:44.079 what are called pro-glacial lakes formed
00:56:46.559 or lakes bodies of water held in by the
00:56:49.520 melting ice
00:56:50.799 and then eventually the ice gave way and
00:56:52.960 the the water rushed out in the form of
00:56:54.960 a flood the icelanders called it a
00:56:56.839 yokolops
00:56:58.079 okay so we have a modern example so
00:57:01.599 what they did was in the 60s and 70s was
00:57:04.160 they said okay
00:57:05.280 guess what we've got now evidence that
00:57:07.119 there was a huge
00:57:08.400 body of water a huge lake in western
00:57:10.400 montana
00:57:11.599 it was held in by an ice dam that ice
00:57:14.079 dam gave way
00:57:15.280 all of this water gushed out over idaho
00:57:17.599 and in southeastern washington down the
00:57:19.599 columbia gorge to the pacific ocean
00:57:22.000 and caused all of these this amazing
00:57:24.160 erosion and
00:57:25.520 sedimentation that harlan bretz was
00:57:28.319 documenting
00:57:30.319 never mind that we have to extrapolate
00:57:32.640 up three orders of magnitude from modern
00:57:35.119 examples
00:57:36.160 right never mind that the modern
00:57:38.000 examples are utterly
00:57:39.359 minuscule compared to what brett's was
00:57:41.359 looking at
00:57:42.480 that has become the dogma to explain
00:57:45.040 these floods
00:57:46.079 and it's still the the entrenched dogma
00:57:48.720 as we speak now
00:57:50.400 i am trying to demolish that dogma i
00:57:52.960 want to show
00:57:54.000 that these floods were something much
00:57:56.880 grander than they have even
00:57:58.480 imagined and that the source of them was
00:58:01.359 not actually a big
00:58:02.480 glacial lake but was was what brett's
00:58:04.880 originally
00:58:06.000 originally theorized was that there was
00:58:08.319 something that caused a rapid melting of
00:58:10.480 the ice
00:58:11.599 but then his critics said well there's
00:58:13.760 nothing that could melt the ice as fast
00:58:15.680 as you're requiring for your flood so
00:58:17.440 again your floods didn't happen
00:58:19.520 but his floods did happen and they were
00:58:21.280 on an enormous
00:58:22.839 inconceivably vast scale and this is
00:58:25.760 what i was taking graham out
00:58:27.680 to see firsthand because i felt like for
00:58:30.160 him to
00:58:31.200 to really have a handle on this
00:58:35.200 this information and this this insight
00:58:38.000 into the catastrophes that that
00:58:39.839 basically would have terminated his
00:58:42.000 mother civilization as he called it that
00:58:44.240 he should see this stuff in the field
00:58:45.760 for himself because
00:58:47.119 you know as they say a picture is worth
00:58:49.280 a thousand words
00:58:50.240 well going out in the field and
00:58:51.599 experiencing this directly is worth a
00:58:53.280 thousand pictures
00:58:55.119 and and so he's gonna incorporate that
00:58:57.839 into
00:58:58.319 into his book and i would like to say
00:59:00.240 about that book that um
00:59:02.079 based upon what i know and what he's
00:59:04.160 shown me a bit of what's going into the
00:59:05.920 book
00:59:06.720 um i'll i'll proclaim without uh
00:59:10.319 any equivocation that i think it's
00:59:11.839 probably going to be the most important
00:59:13.119 book that's come out in the 21st century
00:59:15.280 because it's it's opening a window onto
00:59:17.359 this story like no other
00:59:19.440 single source of information credible
00:59:21.520 information wow
00:59:23.119 that's a big that's a big statement this
00:59:25.200 whole thing is so mind-blowing and as
00:59:27.200 mind-blowing as your first appearance
00:59:28.640 this this
00:59:29.280 chart especially is really freaking me
00:59:31.680 out like looking at the mortality all
00:59:33.440 the animals the mass extinction event
00:59:35.200 that must have taken place
00:59:36.880 one of the things that always bothered
00:59:38.160 me about that idea that human beings
00:59:39.920 killed off the woolly mammoths is that
00:59:41.440 they found these
00:59:42.640 vast fields of uneaten mammoths where
00:59:45.680 there was
00:59:46.079 thousands of them that had died almost
00:59:48.280 instantaneously
00:59:49.599 yeah which is just that doesn't make any
00:59:52.000 sense like what did they do they
00:59:53.440 went on a mass killing orgy of of
00:59:56.640 slaughter and then just decided not to
00:59:58.720 eat any of them
01:00:00.160 well you know the field evidence itself
01:00:02.240 is inconsistent with that idea right
01:00:04.240 here this is an example this is one of
01:00:06.000 the
01:00:06.799 many mammoth cemeteries and and what
01:00:10.079 happens is that you can see here that
01:00:12.079 you can see from the shoreline see that
01:00:13.520 there was a flood the
01:00:15.200 the river rose up to this level and then
01:00:18.079 when it rose down it left this
01:00:20.079 in its wake and what you see here like
01:00:22.559 this is bone counting
01:00:24.000 at the barrel like mammoth cemetery in
01:00:25.760 northern yakutia siberia
01:00:28.000 identical deposits are found throughout
01:00:29.680 the thamer peninsula
01:00:31.280 and what we see here is these massive
01:00:33.680 bone deposits that have been
01:00:35.359 showing up for the last couple of
01:00:36.960 hundred years
01:00:38.880 every time that there's you know a
01:00:40.720 thawing or a flood
01:00:42.480 uh or these things are washed up on the
01:00:44.319 shore of the arctic ocean
01:00:45.920 you know what we see is that there were
01:00:47.440 huge huge herds of woolly mammoths
01:00:50.640 grazing where now the the plant
01:00:54.079 material is only two inches high so
01:00:56.559 clearly
01:00:57.359 it was a completely different climate
01:00:59.359 there you know what's interesting is
01:01:01.200 that you
01:01:01.680 you had in siberia able to support herds
01:01:04.079 of woolly mammoths
01:01:05.920 at the same time that half of north
01:01:08.880 america is buried under two miles or
01:01:10.720 more of ice
01:01:12.240 how is that possible just a totally
01:01:14.480 different atmosphere still puzzling over
01:01:16.400 that i have some ideas but
01:01:18.079 you know until i can test these ideas a
01:01:20.160 little further
01:01:21.359 so without ice core samples is it
01:01:23.760 impossible to figure out what the
01:01:25.839 temperature was in siberia at that time
01:01:28.480 no no they can figure out basically
01:01:30.400 based upon fossil
01:01:32.000 plant remains and you can see that in
01:01:34.319 some cases the tree line was hundreds of
01:01:36.079 miles further north
01:01:37.280 than it is now and that's clearly if
01:01:39.280 you've got trees
01:01:40.480 forests growing now where you know 13 or
01:01:43.920 14 or 15
01:01:44.880 000 years ago it was permafrost you know
01:01:46.960 it was warmer
01:01:48.319 clearly so there's still whoa
01:01:52.799 what is that 19th century scene showing
01:01:54.799 ivory floor of the london docks covered
01:01:56.960 by
01:01:57.280 thousands of mammoth tusks from siberia
01:01:59.440 this is a a
01:02:00.480 drawing obviously yeah predates uh
01:02:03.839 photographs
01:02:04.640 yeah for hundreds of years thousands
01:02:08.319 of mammoths entombed mammoths and
01:02:10.720 mammoth tusks were being exhumed
01:02:13.039 from the siberian permafrost thousands
01:02:15.760 and thousands and thousands of these
01:02:18.799 and and basically to me you look at this
01:02:22.000 this is just in your face evidence that
01:02:24.880 this was not
01:02:25.680 humans doing this you know it was not
01:02:28.160 humans that were
01:02:29.119 were slaughtering these mammoths and
01:02:31.200 burying their remains
01:02:33.119 well it would it's the instantaneous
01:02:35.200 nature would almost
01:02:36.400 it would almost be like people had
01:02:37.760 figured out some new thing like they
01:02:39.680 figured out some
01:02:40.799 some like a doom gun you know
01:02:43.920 they jumped and they shot the whole
01:02:47.280 the doom gun well look at look at the
01:02:49.839 near extinction of american bison
01:02:51.920 what brought that about trains and
01:02:55.200 high-powered rifles right it was a
01:02:57.440 technological
01:02:58.799 major technological advancement that was
01:03:00.720 able to bring about the
01:03:02.799 near extermination of the americans
01:03:04.319 there's actually a guy that i'm going to
01:03:05.920 bring on the podcast soon to discuss
01:03:08.000 that his name is dan flores who's been
01:03:09.760 is in
01:03:11.119 a big chunk of his intellectual career
01:03:14.319 studying this
01:03:15.359 and what he believes is that the bison
01:03:18.480 had a massive population jump
01:03:22.319 that was directly correlating to
01:03:24.880 smallpox epidemic
01:03:26.559 on the native american people and that
01:03:29.200 when
01:03:29.680 the united states uh when we look at the
01:03:32.079 united states history
01:03:33.599 and the big stacks of wooly mammoths or
01:03:35.760 excuse me the big stacks of bison skulls
01:03:37.839 we always look to like that was a very
01:03:40.640 unusual population of bison that existed
01:03:43.680 because
01:03:44.079 the plains indians had experienced this
01:03:46.640 massive extinction event and then
01:03:48.720 when they had incorporated the horse
01:03:51.680 like the horse
01:03:52.559 and the the apparently the american
01:03:54.559 indians native americans rather
01:03:56.240 were on their way to extripating the
01:03:58.480 bison even before
01:04:00.000 we came along but then they died off in
01:04:02.720 this massive
01:04:05.359 death scenario with the smallpox and all
01:04:08.319 the different diseases
01:04:09.520 that the europeans had brought over here
01:04:12.079 and then
01:04:12.799 the mammoth population or excuse me the
01:04:14.720 bison population had
01:04:16.079 grown like almost unnaturally it'd been
01:04:18.720 much larger than it ever been in the
01:04:20.319 past
01:04:21.039 and that's when the united states was
01:04:24.319 established and that's when all the
01:04:27.039 western european immigrants had come
01:04:28.640 along and started
01:04:29.839 killing off all these bisons it's really
01:04:32.480 a very interesting
01:04:33.599 subject and it's an interesting idea
01:04:36.079 it's plausible i
01:04:37.039 i haven't looked into that
01:04:40.720 you know i i just assumed and maybe
01:04:42.640 maybe wrongfully but i had assumed that
01:04:44.319 the
01:04:44.880 bison population had been relatively
01:04:47.119 stable
01:04:48.079 i am not convinced though that that
01:04:50.799 there was this massive die off of the
01:04:53.119 native american population yet
01:04:55.119 i'm not convinced maybe well because i
01:04:57.200 haven't looked into it yet but
01:04:58.720 but you know one of the things i have
01:05:00.000 seen is that um the assumption there is
01:05:02.319 predicated upon that the europeans
01:05:03.920 arrived and brought the diseases that
01:05:06.400 that native americans had no defenses
01:05:08.559 for but
01:05:09.440 the thing is is that you know there's so
01:05:11.520 much evidence now
01:05:12.559 showing that you know there were lots of
01:05:15.440 uh
01:05:16.240 um explorers and immigrants to the new
01:05:19.119 world
01:05:19.760 prior to the arrival of the europeans
01:05:22.400 you know whether with the chinese the
01:05:24.000 phoenicians and i'm not necessarily
01:05:25.680 saying that's credible
01:05:26.720 none of it's been proven but there's
01:05:28.160 some interesting data out there that
01:05:30.720 suggests and there are a number of books
01:05:32.400 written
01:05:32.880 that again i haven't accessed it i i so
01:05:35.280 so i'm not going to
01:05:36.319 sit here and pretend that i'm an
01:05:37.280 authority on that because i'm not but
01:05:39.359 but if some of that turns out to be
01:05:40.960 credible it would suggest that there was
01:05:43.039 a lot more interaction between the
01:05:44.960 native american population and other
01:05:46.880 groups around the world
01:05:48.720 which if true to me
01:05:51.760 kind of somewhat undermines this idea
01:05:54.160 that they were
01:05:54.880 um you know completely susceptible
01:05:58.640 to the introduction of these you know to
01:06:01.520 these foreign diseases
01:06:02.799 but but again i will i've got an open
01:06:05.119 mind i'll wait and see
01:06:06.319 i'd like to see what his what he says
01:06:08.319 i'd like to hear his
01:06:09.680 his uh um his ideas for anyone
01:06:12.160 interested
01:06:12.720 he has a paper in the journal of
01:06:14.960 american history it's called
01:06:16.640 bison ecology and bison diplomacy
01:06:20.319 the southern plains from 1800 to 1850.
01:06:25.119 i just looked for it online you can
01:06:27.200 there's a preview that's available but
01:06:29.039 to download the entire paper
01:06:31.039 or book i'm not sure which one it is
01:06:33.039 it's 19
01:06:34.319 yeah and what's what journal is it in
01:06:36.319 the journal of
01:06:38.079 american history from september of 91
01:06:42.160 and like i said he's working on a new
01:06:44.000 book right now
01:06:45.200 and uh i'm trying to get him to come in
01:06:47.119 but it's just it's very difficult while
01:06:48.720 he's in the middle of uh
01:06:50.319 you said september of 1991 yeah yeah i
01:06:52.720 can probably access dan
01:06:54.240 flores is his name and uh
01:06:57.440 well just the information that i got
01:06:59.280 about it was pretty mind-blowing
01:07:01.200 but uh sounds interesting i wanna i
01:07:03.520 wanna i wanna know more
01:07:05.520 thank you for that joe yeah please um
01:07:07.520 now let's let's go back to that photo
01:07:10.079 that you have on your desktop that you
01:07:12.160 were gonna explain to me but we decided
01:07:14.160 not to talk about it before
01:07:15.680 uh the podcast because it's so
01:07:17.280 incredible
01:07:19.039 that you said this all this incredible
01:07:22.480 change that we're looking at the the
01:07:25.440 geological structure
01:07:27.760 all that took place within just a week
01:07:30.960 yeah let's go to this we'll come i've
01:07:34.079 got that we'll we'll come to that
01:07:35.599 um this is uh
01:07:39.839 this is a satellite photograph taken
01:07:41.440 from about 500 miles up
01:07:43.680 and what you see here this is
01:07:44.880 southeastern washington and what you're
01:07:46.880 looking at here
01:07:47.680 is part of what's called the columbia
01:07:49.760 basalt plateau
01:07:52.319 this is part of the the terrain that
01:07:54.480 that we crossed when i was with graham
01:07:56.640 um
01:07:57.280 what you see here is that you have an
01:07:59.440 area of
01:08:01.119 if you look here you can see the the um
01:08:03.440 oh
01:08:05.200 differentiate between the pixels and the
01:08:07.200 actual squares that
01:08:08.960 like you see this red area down here is
01:08:11.119 area that's actually being farmed
01:08:13.280 and it's in because this is an infrared
01:08:15.280 photograph and so
01:08:16.719 what happens is is that the areas that
01:08:18.960 are being uh cultivated will show up
01:08:20.960 warmer than the surrounding areas
01:08:22.960 this is this whole plateau is covered in
01:08:24.960 this stuff called loss
01:08:26.679 l-o-e-s-s and it's a type of very
01:08:29.279 fertile
01:08:30.238 soil that has a rather mysterious and
01:08:33.359 controversial origin we
01:08:34.880 won't get into that right now but in
01:08:36.319 some places this lust layer is hundreds
01:08:38.399 of feet thick
01:08:39.359 over a dark basalt bedrock that is a
01:08:42.719 result of
01:08:43.839 of these massive outflows of basaltic
01:08:46.640 lava
01:08:48.238 that that came out that extruded between
01:08:50.560 about 6 million and
01:08:52.158 16 million years ago right
01:08:55.920 the the hot spot that was the ultimate
01:08:58.158 origin of this basalt is now where
01:09:00.080 yellowstone
01:09:00.799 is which so you can make that connection
01:09:03.198 here the yellowstone
01:09:04.319 uh super volcano super volcano yeah yeah
01:09:07.120 it
01:09:07.359 in but what you have here
01:09:11.040 is that you have the lighter areas is
01:09:13.439 where this lost top soil still exists
01:09:16.158 and the darker areas is where the the
01:09:18.640 underlying dark basalt
01:09:20.080 has been is showing through because the
01:09:22.000 lust was
01:09:23.359 washed away so what this is is is your
01:09:26.158 typical
01:09:26.719 the geological term is anastomosing
01:09:29.759 and basically that means a branching
01:09:32.640 flow pattern of the water
01:09:34.319 and you can see that very clearly here
01:09:36.719 that the water
01:09:37.759 came off of this river which is the
01:09:40.000 columbia river up here and flowed over
01:09:41.839 the landscape
01:09:43.359 and washed away the basalt and left
01:09:45.759 these
01:09:46.880 gigantic channels in its wake and
01:09:49.359 there's more over here to the to the
01:09:50.880 east
01:09:51.359 there's more over here to the west
01:09:55.600 and if we look at actually this
01:09:59.280 let me go to a different program here i
01:10:01.360 think that'll actually have
01:10:03.280 some uh that actually i think has the
01:10:06.480 picture in it that you
01:10:09.120 are seeing now what we're looking at
01:10:11.760 here is what's been called the missoula
01:10:13.280 flood
01:10:14.080 right named after the town of missoula
01:10:15.760 montana missoula is in a basin
01:10:18.480 that was part of this hypothesized giant
01:10:21.920 lake
01:10:22.400 that that presumably caused this flood
01:10:24.960 right
01:10:25.840 and again there was an ice dam that
01:10:27.840 there was this ice dam the ice dam broke
01:10:30.400 and as soon as this thing comes up i
01:10:32.480 will be able to show you
01:10:34.320 some slide here we go let's see here we
01:10:37.520 go
01:10:37.920 it should be coming up right here while
01:10:41.040 that's coming up
01:10:42.159 we'll look at this slide right here
01:10:43.600 because this will kind of give you
01:10:45.679 uh a picture of the earth
01:10:49.679 as it was during the height
01:10:53.600 of the ice age
01:10:56.719 so wow that's pretty deep the the sheets
01:10:59.360 of ice go
01:11:00.159 pretty far down that's amazing canada
01:11:02.239 didn't exist canada didn't exist
01:11:04.320 wow yeah poor canadians yeah
01:11:08.080 well yeah and you know and you know
01:11:11.679 the ice part of it is you know a lot of
01:11:13.679 the in the midwest
01:11:14.719 now a lot you know the farming belt of
01:11:17.040 america
01:11:18.080 is basically you know growing out of the
01:11:20.400 fertile soil that the ice scraped off of
01:11:22.560 canada and dumped
01:11:24.080 you know down in minnesota and iowa and
01:11:25.920 wisconsin and so on so
01:11:28.000 um you know someday they may want that
01:11:30.080 back
01:11:31.760 but we're not going to let them have it
01:11:34.320 it's fascinating when you look at that
01:11:36.239 that there's this big ice cap but then
01:11:38.880 the areas around
01:11:40.000 it no ice and why why was that
01:11:44.480 well that's one of the mysteries again
01:11:46.400 like over here in siberia
01:11:48.159 you can see over here this is where all
01:11:49.679 the woolly mammoths were
01:11:51.280 giant herds of oldie mammoths and it
01:11:53.760 appears like it may have been
01:11:55.760 warmer than now during the ice age which
01:11:58.400 is very odd
01:11:59.600 there's some ice up there is that what
01:12:01.280 we're seeing yeah there's some ice up
01:12:02.880 there
01:12:04.000 sporadic glaciers but nothing like what
01:12:06.000 we see in northwestern europe over here
01:12:08.159 this was called
01:12:09.040 the fenno scandian ice sheet and the ice
01:12:12.159 sheet over
01:12:12.960 north america actually consisted of two
01:12:15.280 ice sheets the lauren tide
01:12:17.120 which was centered over hudson bay and
01:12:19.120 the cordiary which was centered over the
01:12:20.880 canadian rockies
01:12:22.400 and in this particular slide you can see
01:12:26.159 uh you can see here this was the
01:12:29.520 cordieran over here
01:12:31.040 on over the canadian rockies and this
01:12:32.800 was the lauren tide was much bigger
01:12:34.960 see and and then there was an area
01:12:37.280 between the two
01:12:38.400 right here which has been theorized as
01:12:41.360 at one point having been a corridor
01:12:44.000 called the ice free corridor and
01:12:46.159 migrants from
01:12:47.280 paleo-indian migrants from siberia
01:12:50.320 would have come across alaska and down
01:12:52.800 through this corridor here to the lower
01:12:55.040 united states and ultimately down here
01:12:58.320 to
01:12:59.440 south america and it was that
01:13:02.480 group these groups of bands of
01:13:04.960 paleo-indian hunters that according to
01:13:06.640 the
01:13:06.960 the overkill or blitzkrieg hypothesis
01:13:09.760 wiped out the
01:13:10.800 the the mega mammals as they as they
01:13:13.360 passed by
01:13:16.840 um that's just
01:13:21.840 let's see okay there we go okay so here
01:13:24.800 this kind of will show
01:13:26.719 uh the coastlines
01:13:29.760 of the uh of the world during
01:13:33.360 the uh during the ice age and uh
01:13:37.280 let me just escape out of this
01:13:42.159 so that we can uh zoom in a little bit
01:13:45.280 and look at it closer okay so
01:13:49.600 here would be
01:13:53.360 as we see now
01:13:56.880 and this is modern coastline this is
01:13:59.040 modern coastlines and now i'm gonna
01:14:00.880 i'm gonna jump to this is actually only
01:14:02.960 300 feet lower than now
01:14:04.719 and
01:14:07.920 quite a bit different let's let's just
01:14:10.800 look at the united states
01:14:12.719 north america that's amazing there's a
01:14:15.440 lot more united states
01:14:16.960 yeah now check this out okay now here
01:14:20.000 here's north america as it is now and
01:14:21.760 you see up here this is what's called
01:14:24.960 this is the bearing straight right here
01:14:27.199 between alaska and siberia
01:14:28.960 right during the ice age this whole area
01:14:33.360 was exposed because of the lowered sea
01:14:36.960 level and we'll go
01:14:37.840 one slide further and you will see take
01:14:39.520 a look now watch what happens up there
01:14:41.040 in
01:14:41.520 beringia boom wow so it's all
01:14:44.800 land it's all land and it's connecting
01:14:46.960 north america to siberia
01:14:48.560 and that's all drowned well i didn't
01:14:50.239 understand that see i always thought the
01:14:51.600 bering strait was an ice mass
01:14:53.440 i thought it was during the ice age that
01:14:55.600 there was some sort of
01:14:56.640 yes that it was ice but it's not it's
01:14:59.600 land
01:15:00.080 it's land wow and it's not glaciated
01:15:03.440 and it was home to these extraordinary
01:15:06.640 herds of mega mammals that ranged over
01:15:10.320 these
01:15:10.800 thousands and thousands of square miles
01:15:12.480 i mean the drowned area is bigger than
01:15:14.080 modern alaska
01:15:15.280 so how how long ago is this well this is
01:15:17.679 you know right at the end up until the
01:15:19.120 end of the ice age
01:15:20.320 you know between like 14 15 000 years
01:15:22.719 ago 14 50
01:15:23.760 000 years ago no glaciers in this area
01:15:25.679 this is all just land and there's
01:15:27.199 animals living in it and people are
01:15:28.560 walking back and forth is i mean
01:15:30.400 essentially it was a continent i mean it
01:15:32.719 was connected
01:15:33.600 it was all one continent it was all one
01:15:36.080 it was all one continent wow that's
01:15:38.560 amazing
01:15:39.600 and not the coastlines of the world look
01:15:43.040 at florida down here
01:15:45.120 see it's double the width of the modern
01:15:47.360 peninsula
01:15:48.239 yeah it's enormous and it's so close to
01:15:51.040 mexico too it's almost like a little
01:15:52.800 yeah a little boat ride
01:15:54.719 now here is indonesia and you know where
01:15:57.600 where
01:15:58.320 stories which i don't know how credible
01:16:00.239 they are but you know there are stories
01:16:01.679 like lemuria in the pacific and all of
01:16:03.679 that
01:16:04.480 again i don't know how credible those
01:16:05.840 are i think the atlanta story actually
01:16:07.440 has a little more credibility we talked
01:16:09.040 about that last time somewhat but
01:16:10.800 here's the modern and you can see the
01:16:12.239 light blue is the is the coastal shelf
01:16:14.400 area
01:16:15.120 right now let's go back drop we're going
01:16:17.679 to drop sea level 300 feet
01:16:19.360 and then you'll see here the enormous
01:16:22.159 change
01:16:23.199 whoa so again enormous areas of land
01:16:27.040 were drowned by the rising sea levels
01:16:29.920 remember this now when we look at the
01:16:31.360 rise of modern cities in modern
01:16:33.199 civilizations where did they first show
01:16:34.960 up
01:16:35.199 where's the coasts on the coasts right
01:16:37.280 at the mouths of rivers on the
01:16:38.640 coastlines
01:16:39.920 and and during the ice age where would
01:16:42.159 have been the most obvious
01:16:43.760 prime habitable real estate you know
01:16:45.840 down close to sea level right so if
01:16:48.239 there were cities built
01:16:50.159 you know if they were thriving
01:16:51.440 communities during the ice age they're
01:16:53.280 now 400 feet under the water
01:16:55.360 it's so amazing that all of these
01:16:57.280 stories of
01:16:58.880 the floods the epic of gilgamesh noah's
01:17:02.239 ark
01:17:02.960 yeah that all of these stories seem to
01:17:07.280 really correlate with with all this data
01:17:10.080 i mean they all
01:17:11.040 seem to coincide that's exactly the
01:17:13.840 point
01:17:14.320 it's so weird okay you know most people
01:17:17.840 would think about the story of noah's
01:17:19.120 ark
01:17:19.600 oh it's just some crazy old horseshit
01:17:22.000 but
01:17:22.719 most likely this they're basing it on
01:17:25.920 something that happened very rapidly in
01:17:28.800 their
01:17:29.199 area yeah now of course we're
01:17:33.120 most familiar with the story of noah's
01:17:34.719 ark you know because of the
01:17:35.920 judeo-christian tradition but there are
01:17:38.159 hundreds literally hundreds of stories
01:17:40.960 from
01:17:41.280 all over the world that parallel the
01:17:43.199 story of noah deukelian
01:17:45.280 uh zisithrus utnapishtum manu
01:17:48.960 that list goes on and on of these
01:17:50.560 culture heroes
01:17:52.159 that somehow had foreknowledge of this
01:17:54.719 impending disaster
01:17:56.320 and were able to take steps to preserve
01:17:59.040 themselves their family
01:18:01.199 some diverse cross-section of of species
01:18:05.280 um which and they all have this you know
01:18:08.560 similarity they all parallel now
01:18:11.440 my way of looking at it is this okay we
01:18:13.840 now know from the hard geological record
01:18:16.719 that massive floods have taken place on
01:18:19.440 the surface of the earth
01:18:20.719 massive floods right beyond anything
01:18:23.440 that we have even imagined
01:18:25.040 right up until a decade or a few decades
01:18:27.520 ago
01:18:28.400 they're real okay on the other hand we
01:18:31.040 have stories and myths and legends
01:18:33.520 repeatedly it's probably the most
01:18:34.880 ubiquitous of all the stories that we've
01:18:37.600 inherited from the past is the story of
01:18:39.679 this
01:18:40.000 gigantic world destroying flood that
01:18:42.719 occurred
01:18:43.520 right now on the one hand we have the
01:18:46.000 geological hard geological record which
01:18:48.080 shows
01:18:48.640 there were giant floods then we have
01:18:50.640 these epic tales and myths from all over
01:18:52.880 the world
01:18:53.360 about giant floods do we now dismiss
01:18:56.719 those floods those those stories out of
01:18:58.640 hand and say oh that's just
01:19:00.480 superstitious pre-literate you know
01:19:02.880 pseudoscientific nonsense
01:19:05.760 i think we'd be making a big mistake to
01:19:07.360 do that now
01:19:09.440 if we accept that those flood stories
01:19:12.560 and maybe they have been altered through
01:19:14.719 the time and through the telling
01:19:17.040 represent something real what about the
01:19:20.159 other
01:19:20.800 other uh elements of the story the fact
01:19:23.120 that in so many cases
01:19:25.360 there was somebody that had
01:19:26.480 foreknowledge do we dismiss that
01:19:29.360 out of hand as well you know or where
01:19:31.360 does that come from that there was
01:19:33.600 one group of people small group of
01:19:35.280 people that saw this thing coming
01:19:37.679 and prepared for it and others who
01:19:40.159 basically
01:19:41.440 paid no attention maybe they were just
01:19:43.120 preppers maybe there's the preppers of
01:19:44.960 ten thousand years ago the preference of
01:19:46.400 ten thousand years ago
01:19:48.159 that explains it right there
01:19:51.360 one last slide quick here here's here's
01:19:53.360 europe and look at the british isles
01:19:55.920 right now we'll drop sea level
01:19:59.120 no british isles that's incredible see
01:20:01.920 that's what i was saying earlier when we
01:20:03.199 started our talk i mean the world
01:20:04.800 of 15 000 years ago was so dramatically
01:20:07.920 different than our modern world
01:20:10.159 that you know it's it's almost difficult
01:20:12.560 to conceive until you start
01:20:14.320 looking at things like this and this is
01:20:16.480 all during the ice age
01:20:17.920 yes and so the melting of the glaciers
01:20:20.639 just changed
01:20:21.679 everything everything and this is why
01:20:24.159 human beings were absolutely alive
01:20:26.159 absolutely absolutely no question human
01:20:29.199 beings
01:20:29.760 were alive yes okay
01:20:32.960 so we'll start looking at some of these
01:20:35.120 pictures here this is from western
01:20:36.639 montana you know it says
01:20:38.320 in genesis 7 19. the waters prevailed
01:20:41.360 exceedingly upon the earth and all the
01:20:43.040 high hills were covered
01:20:44.400 i want you to take a look as you can see
01:20:46.080 many mountains
01:20:47.440 in in western united states if you know
01:20:49.679 what you're looking at
01:20:51.760 that have this on them you know what
01:20:54.080 those are those horizontal lines
01:20:56.239 they look like like where the shore
01:20:58.320 they're shorelines
01:20:59.440 exactly they're shorelines that's
01:21:00.800 absolutely what they are that's
01:21:01.920 absolutely what they are they're
01:21:03.040 shorelines
01:21:04.320 reaching right up to the very tops of
01:21:05.840 the hills you see and and
01:21:07.600 basically what you had was you had this
01:21:10.400 enormous
01:21:11.440 gush of water filling these mountain
01:21:13.840 valleys almost to the
01:21:15.360 mountain peaks and then draining away
01:21:17.440 and as it drained away
01:21:19.360 it left the succession of shorelines
01:21:21.440 etched into the hillside
01:21:22.960 wow
01:21:26.960 and all along the pathway of the floods
01:21:30.080 we're going to see stuff like this
01:21:32.159 this right this was our first stop with
01:21:34.719 graham
01:21:35.280 this is uh la torrell falls this is that
01:21:38.239 basalt i was talking about
01:21:39.920 look at this stuff there's layers of
01:21:42.400 this basalt
01:21:43.280 well that's you guys underneath it um
01:21:46.480 i don't think in this bit i think i took
01:21:47.920 this picture about 10 years ago but yeah
01:21:49.440 i have pictures of
01:21:50.719 me and graham under there well you're so
01:21:52.719 tiny that's so crazy it's so big
01:21:55.440 right now here's what you've got a
01:21:57.280 picture joe
01:21:59.120 picture you've got this nice gentle
01:22:00.960 valley with a nice
01:22:03.120 river very pastoral scene you know trees
01:22:05.679 and stuff
01:22:06.560 probably you know mammoths and herds of
01:22:09.360 these animals
01:22:10.480 grazing along the side of this peaceful
01:22:12.239 river with gentle
01:22:13.679 cha valley slopes here comes this
01:22:16.960 massive flood and we're talking about
01:22:18.719 perhaps a flood wave 800 to a thousand
01:22:21.440 feet high
01:22:22.800 coming through as it comes through it's
01:22:25.040 ripping up everything in its path
01:22:27.199 and it what it does is it now changes
01:22:29.600 the profile of this valley from this
01:22:31.280 gentle
01:22:31.840 profile to down cutting
01:22:34.880 800 1200 feet or more
01:22:38.159 into the bedrock right so now prior
01:22:41.679 to the passage of this giant flood you
01:22:44.080 had streams and
01:22:45.520 nice little rivers flowing into the main
01:22:47.360 river which in this case was the
01:22:48.719 columbia
01:22:49.920 what happens is after the passage of
01:22:51.679 this flood wave it sheared off
01:22:53.920 the sides of the channel so now rather
01:22:56.400 than a gentle slope you've got sheer
01:22:58.000 cliffs four
01:22:58.719 five six hundred feet high these
01:23:00.960 pre-flood
01:23:01.840 streams and rivers come up and they're
01:23:03.760 now waterfalls
01:23:05.120 and that's what we're looking at right
01:23:06.400 here in this picture if that makes sense
01:23:08.320 to you
01:23:09.040 and and you notice how you've got this
01:23:11.760 undercutting here
01:23:13.520 that undercutting only occurs when you
01:23:16.400 have
01:23:16.960 enormous intense turbulence in the water
01:23:20.320 doing this
01:23:22.000 you see the water doing this will
01:23:25.199 undercut see this
01:23:28.239 modern waterfall here had nothing to do
01:23:31.520 with the creation of this cliff
01:23:33.520 this cliff was cut again probably in a
01:23:36.480 matter of days to weeks by the passage
01:23:39.040 of these giant floods
01:23:40.800 and there's dozens of these waterfalls
01:23:43.600 that are left
01:23:44.400 they're called and these are called
01:23:45.679 hanging valleys they can be produced by
01:23:48.239 glaciers but they can also be produced
01:23:50.080 by
01:23:50.960 enormous intense flood waves
01:23:54.560 this is your typical no wait a minute
01:23:57.040 not typical
01:23:57.679 this is called this is a a bar
01:24:01.280 a gravel bar but in this case it's a
01:24:03.440 boulder bar now if you've ever done any
01:24:05.040 walking along a river
01:24:06.560 or a creek or along the beach and you've
01:24:09.520 seen ripples
01:24:10.880 in the sand and they're typically you
01:24:13.920 know if you've got
01:24:14.960 a water that's a foot or two feet deep
01:24:17.679 you'll have ripples that are maybe an
01:24:19.120 inch or two high
01:24:21.040 what we're looking at here is a flood
01:24:23.280 bar that's three miles long
01:24:25.760 it's up to 250 feet above the modern
01:24:28.560 river
01:24:29.360 and the ripples that you can see here
01:24:33.520 are up to
01:24:37.440 50 feet in height and 350 feet in
01:24:40.480 wavelength
01:24:41.760 this was produced again by gigantic
01:24:45.040 flood flows
01:24:46.320 and if we look right over here that's a
01:24:48.560 three-story building you see right there
01:24:50.719 for scale oh wow so this this gives you
01:24:53.920 an idea
01:24:55.040 it's it's features like this that are
01:24:57.120 just unequivocal
01:24:58.880 in terms of realizing that this is this
01:25:01.199 isn't
01:25:02.320 not pseudoscience this really happened
01:25:05.199 and
01:25:05.679 this is there's this date back to a very
01:25:08.239 specific time
01:25:09.199 yes to this thirteen thousand years so
01:25:12.400 it's
01:25:12.639 healthier everywhere you're seeing this
01:25:14.719 you've seen it geologically you've seen
01:25:16.320 in ice cores you've seen it in fossils
01:25:18.400 yes yes wow this is evidence of the big
01:25:21.360 meltdown
01:25:22.480 has anybody ever tried to debate you on
01:25:23.920 this stuff uh
01:25:26.480 i would certainly welcome debate i don't
01:25:28.159 claim to have the final final word on
01:25:30.239 this but you know here's the thing i've
01:25:31.920 i've interacted with a lot of geologists
01:25:34.639 that are studying this
01:25:36.000 professional geologists that are
01:25:37.360 studying this what i can tell you is
01:25:39.280 that in most cases
01:25:40.480 the geologists that are studying this
01:25:42.320 it's it's not something
01:25:43.840 it's basically something they're doing
01:25:45.040 in their spare time um
01:25:47.199 most of them are engaged you know either
01:25:49.040 you know in the uh
01:25:50.400 energy industry or working for
01:25:52.400 government for other purposes
01:25:54.960 what you actually will see here though
01:25:56.480 when you begin to look at the the trend
01:25:58.400 in the evidence is that i think that the
01:26:00.239 geological community is moving much
01:26:02.239 closer
01:26:03.199 to a scenario like i'm describing and
01:26:05.600 right now there's actually a controversy
01:26:07.199 because you know some of the
01:26:08.719 the older guard is wanting to defend
01:26:10.560 this idea of the yokelups this
01:26:13.360 pro this giant lake uh draining out
01:26:16.719 there are a group of canadian geologists
01:26:18.719 though who are challenging that
01:26:20.480 under uh leadership of a man who may now
01:26:23.360 be retired named john
01:26:24.560 shaw who goes back to the 1980s and
01:26:27.360 began
01:26:28.159 um a reinterpretation of a very
01:26:31.040 ubiquitous glacial feature called
01:26:32.800 drumlands
01:26:34.080 um and and that were uh
01:26:37.280 i can show you some pictures of them
01:26:38.480 here after a bit they're they're very
01:26:39.840 interesting um
01:26:41.199 they look like inverted boat hulls and
01:26:43.679 and it was assumed and they're always
01:26:45.199 associated with the
01:26:46.480 the the locations of the glaciers and
01:26:49.440 the ice sheets
01:26:50.480 so it was therefore assumed that they
01:26:51.920 were somehow created by
01:26:53.600 the glaciers themselves but glaciers
01:26:56.000 tend to grind
01:26:57.199 things that they're moving over and
01:26:59.120 level things off
01:27:00.400 and scratch them and leave striations
01:27:03.280 and all of this
01:27:04.320 abrasion these drumlins are smooth
01:27:07.840 streamlined features what what shaw
01:27:11.120 first proposed back in the late 80s was
01:27:13.920 that they had actually been produced by
01:27:15.600 water flowing massive amounts of water
01:27:18.880 flowing under the glaciers and there's a
01:27:22.239 very similar the the the critic said
01:27:24.159 well where did this water come from
01:27:26.320 and he said well i don't know it must
01:27:27.360 have been enormous sub-glacial lakes
01:27:29.360 sub-glacial reservoirs
01:27:31.120 the critics said well there's no way
01:27:32.800 that that a reservoir as
01:27:35.040 huge as your floods would require could
01:27:37.040 have existed under the ice
01:27:38.560 therefore your subglacial floods didn't
01:27:40.880 exist
01:27:42.239 and that was the to me the fatal
01:27:44.960 weakness in his theory was
01:27:46.560 to explain where the water came from but
01:27:48.880 i think now we can't explain where it
01:27:50.320 came from and you believe it's an
01:27:51.840 asteroidal impact
01:27:53.600 again by default i there's there we have
01:27:56.400 we look at all the possible the cross
01:27:58.159 section of possible explanations within
01:28:00.080 the realm of nature
01:28:01.440 we can go through and we can eliminate
01:28:03.040 this one this one this one this one this
01:28:04.880 one and what we're left with is one
01:28:07.360 that of itself would be fully capable of
01:28:09.520 doing it fully capable and makes sense
01:28:11.520 that it would happen instantaneously
01:28:12.800 that would make sense it would happen
01:28:14.080 instantaneously any other sort of thing
01:28:15.600 that would
01:28:16.000 yes so is there an impact crater that
01:28:18.639 corresponds to this
01:28:19.679 timeline well that's what i'm working on
01:28:21.760 uh trying to find it
01:28:23.199 yeah and i think i've i think i've got a
01:28:25.280 pretty good idea but it's going to take
01:28:26.800 some field research and next summer
01:28:29.199 i'm planning to do some some more field
01:28:31.840 is there an idea where it hit
01:28:34.080 uh yeah i have several ideas you don't
01:28:35.760 want to talk about it keep it mom
01:28:38.400 stealing but when i when when it's when
01:28:40.719 it's time to reveal it
01:28:42.000 okay let's do it here i would love that
01:28:43.920 i would love that well
01:28:45.520 you you've shown several impact craters
01:28:48.320 you showed a bunch last time you were
01:28:49.679 here the the one in australia
01:28:51.760 um that was i believe you said 5000
01:28:54.080 years ago
01:28:55.360 yeah yeah and of course everything
01:28:58.000 hypothetically it hasn't been proven yet
01:28:59.920 because again
01:29:00.960 uh some of these more recent craters of
01:29:03.520 the last ten
01:29:04.239 thousand years um some of these that
01:29:06.719 have been hypothesized are
01:29:08.159 actually on the bottom of the ocean the
01:29:09.760 berkel crater that i think we talked
01:29:11.360 about on the bottom of the indian ocean
01:29:13.600 it's under two miles of sea water so
01:29:15.840 until we can actually get back there
01:29:17.840 and and do more in-depth sampling and
01:29:20.719 examination it'll be impossible to prove
01:29:22.719 it but uh
01:29:24.159 i think that the the evidence is
01:29:25.920 strongly supportive of that possibility
01:29:28.400 that
01:29:28.800 maybe five thousand years ago there was
01:29:30.320 a significant impact into the indian
01:29:32.239 ocean
01:29:33.120 that could have caused enormous tsunami
01:29:34.960 waves now i actually posted one of the
01:29:37.600 uh
01:29:38.480 somebody you know uh called into
01:29:41.440 question
01:29:42.000 some of the things i had said in the
01:29:43.360 last interview about tsunamis
01:29:46.320 and that um that the things i was saying
01:29:48.960 weren't really tsunamis so i
01:29:51.040 actually wrote an elaborate response to
01:29:53.600 that which
01:29:54.639 is posted on the sacred geometry website
01:29:57.040 where i've gone into
01:29:58.400 great detail showing that the evidence
01:30:01.920 really in the end i think does support
01:30:04.000 the idea that there had been enormous
01:30:06.080 tsunamis possibly hundreds of feet high
01:30:09.679 sweeping over the coastlines of the
01:30:11.280 indian ocean probably around 5000 years
01:30:13.600 ago
01:30:14.719 that could have been the origin of some
01:30:17.040 of the flood myths
01:30:18.560 and your timeline where this mass
01:30:21.600 extinction event occurred
01:30:23.199 where the massive warming occurred all
01:30:26.320 that
01:30:26.719 also coincides with the discovery of
01:30:29.520 this nuclear glass
01:30:31.440 all over asia and europe um which is
01:30:34.400 somewhere
01:30:35.120 in the when they do the core samples of
01:30:38.000 around the same area right
01:30:39.280 around 12 000 plus years ago yes what we
01:30:42.239 can see
01:30:42.800 here uh we'll go through a second this
01:30:45.840 is some of the research
01:30:47.920 you can see this is this is very typical
01:30:51.280 the mysterious onset of the younger
01:30:53.120 dryas now
01:30:55.040 this is this has been the kind of the
01:30:56.800 consensus view is that okay
01:30:58.719 we don't have an explanation the younger
01:31:00.320 driest remembers that's that interval
01:31:01.840 between those two spikes
01:31:03.440 right where you had the warming then the
01:31:06.000 snap back to glacial cold
01:31:08.080 and then the warming again so that
01:31:09.440 interval in between is the younger
01:31:11.120 driest
01:31:12.159 so here they're saying the mysterious
01:31:14.400 onset of the younger driest the 1300
01:31:16.639 year long younger driest cold
01:31:18.480 reversal and you notice the dates 12 900
01:31:21.120 to 11
01:31:21.920 600 that means calendar years before
01:31:25.120 present
01:31:26.080 so what they've done is they've
01:31:27.120 calibrated this from radiocarbon dating
01:31:29.760 to which is not necessarily going to be
01:31:31.679 the same as the actual calendar years
01:31:33.920 so those dates are very interesting
01:31:37.840 11 600 years ago you may recall from our
01:31:40.800 last interview
01:31:42.159 is the date given by plato for the
01:31:44.239 subsidence of atlantis
01:31:45.920 eleven thousand i mean he says that
01:31:48.159 atlantis subsided in you can
01:31:50.000 anybody can read this if they want to
01:31:51.520 pick up timaeus and critias the two
01:31:53.760 dialogues that he
01:31:55.199 describes atlantis in he gives that date
01:31:57.840 9 000 years
01:31:59.280 before this exile of solon in egypt
01:32:02.560 which took place in 600 bc
01:32:04.400 roughly so 600 bc
01:32:07.440 in rough roughly is 2600 years ago add
01:32:09.920 that to the 9 000 years and there's your
01:32:11.600 eleven thousand six hundred
01:32:13.280 so now what has happened is two thousand
01:32:15.440 five hundred years ago plato gave a date
01:32:17.920 which would seem to suggest that
01:32:19.520 something some something immense
01:32:21.280 happened in the atlantic ocean
01:32:22.960 and you had an island complex that sank
01:32:26.080 perhaps from rapid sea level rise now
01:32:29.199 2500 years later here's modern science
01:32:32.239 coming up with the exact date showing
01:32:33.920 hey there was a massive melt water pulse
01:32:35.840 into the ocean
01:32:36.960 at that date now at this point nobody
01:32:40.159 within mainstream science is going
01:32:42.239 oh well see he doesn't mention here oh
01:32:44.080 that's the date given by plato
01:32:46.159 they don't say that but it's it is the
01:32:48.639 case that's incredible
01:32:50.400 yeah that's so amazing now plato that he
01:32:52.639 was told that right
01:32:54.320 it was all through stories it was yeah
01:32:56.239 it was handed down solon handed it down
01:32:58.320 let's see if i can remember this
01:32:59.520 the the through depridus dropitis to
01:33:02.080 cradius the elder creed is the elder to
01:33:04.080 criticise the younger
01:33:05.679 then cretius the younger i guess the
01:33:07.840 socrates
01:33:09.520 actually at the forum where plato would
01:33:11.600 have heard it would have been the
01:33:12.560 socratic forum
01:33:14.000 where it was told so i think there was
01:33:15.199 like three generations between
01:33:17.920 solon and plato the wise men of the time
01:33:21.440 or the people
01:33:22.000 that were in charge of disseminating
01:33:23.679 knowledge back then it was such a
01:33:25.120 critical job
01:33:26.320 critical job yes no internet no books
01:33:28.639 and and
01:33:29.679 the whole the whole thing was was that
01:33:31.840 the whole emphasis
01:33:33.280 was on transmit the oral transmission
01:33:36.480 had to take place without not one iota
01:33:39.040 of change
01:33:40.239 it had to be transmitted from mouth to
01:33:42.639 ear
01:33:44.080 unbroken without change without
01:33:45.920 alteration which has always been the
01:33:47.760 issue with human beings
01:33:49.040 hence that telephone game yeah you know
01:33:51.360 you tell someone something
01:33:52.639 they tell you something it's but if you
01:33:55.040 start out and you know
01:33:56.639 it's going to be the same with native
01:33:57.760 americans the native american
01:33:59.120 storytellers have to go through a very
01:34:00.880 long arduous
01:34:03.199 term of initiation to show that when
01:34:05.760 they tell the story it's going to be
01:34:07.280 exactly
01:34:08.080 like they heard it that's one of the
01:34:10.080 basis of modern freemasonry too
01:34:12.000 we need to get that with today's modern
01:34:14.080 gossip
01:34:15.040 yeah they need to nail that but let's
01:34:17.040 just run through a quick succession here
01:34:18.480 of some of the most recent research
01:34:20.880 shock synthesized hexagonal diamonds
01:34:24.239 in younger driest boundary sediments
01:34:26.320 whoa now these shock synthesized
01:34:28.320 hexagonal diamonds
01:34:29.520 only occur there's no natural known
01:34:32.560 natural process that will produce them
01:34:34.880 except for the intense heat and
01:34:37.120 pressures of a cosmic impact
01:34:39.679 wow okay and what what year was this
01:34:42.239 study
01:34:43.040 oh this has been very recent this is
01:34:44.960 probably within the last 10 years
01:34:46.880 there was since 2007 this is probably
01:34:49.520 around 2011.
01:34:51.440 there was something that was released
01:34:52.800 very recently about micro
01:34:54.719 diamonds and micro diamonds
01:34:56.320 corresponding last summer yeah and that
01:34:58.400 also was the same timeline so it's just
01:35:00.320 like
01:35:00.719 the evidence keeps accumulating in this
01:35:02.719 time period that something hit us
01:35:04.560 yes the micro diamonds the the the
01:35:07.440 nuclear glass
01:35:08.719 yes the spikes in warming that's
01:35:10.800 observable on the ice cores all
01:35:12.480 correlates the
01:35:13.600 mass extinction events of all these
01:35:15.440 animals this is an event
01:35:17.119 this is an event this is crazy that
01:35:19.600 you're you're the guy talking about this
01:35:21.199 event i mean this is really nuts
01:35:23.679 but not anything taking away from you
01:35:25.520 but there's so few people
01:35:27.119 beating this drum that there's so much
01:35:29.600 information
01:35:30.560 we're talking about hard data you've
01:35:33.280 shown on this show
01:35:35.280 three four different examples of hard
01:35:37.280 data that points
01:35:38.960 to this event well see here's the thing
01:35:42.800 modern science does tend to get over
01:35:44.719 specialized
01:35:45.920 and so what happens is the guy looking
01:35:47.760 at extinctions might not be looking at
01:35:50.400 you know glacial melting the guy who's
01:35:52.400 looking at glacial melting
01:35:53.679 isn't the geologist is not looking at
01:35:56.159 what's going on in the sky
01:35:57.920 they're not looking at you know
01:36:00.239 traditions from thousands of years ago
01:36:02.239 so
01:36:03.199 what it does is because of the the power
01:36:06.159 of
01:36:06.800 this specialization i mean the
01:36:08.560 specialization is extremely powerful
01:36:10.719 but it's shortcoming is is that it's
01:36:12.880 easy to miss the big picture what that
01:36:14.639 does
01:36:15.520 is opens the door for generalists
01:36:18.880 guys who are just you know people who
01:36:20.960 are just
01:36:22.000 i say guys men or women anybody who's
01:36:23.920 curious about this stuff
01:36:25.600 to look into it and try to see the big
01:36:27.760 picture
01:36:28.800 why am i bringing this well it's just
01:36:30.400 because for 40 years
01:36:31.920 i've been obsessed with this stuff and
01:36:33.679 you know i read two or three scientific
01:36:35.760 articles
01:36:36.320 every single day and have done so for 40
01:36:39.360 years
01:36:39.920 plus so that adds up after a while and i
01:36:42.880 don't just read them i study them i take
01:36:44.560 notes you know two or three
01:36:45.840 every single day so you figure what is
01:36:48.000 that a thousand a year
01:36:49.920 you go back 40 years that means i
01:36:51.600 probably read something in the order of
01:36:53.040 40
01:36:53.600 000 scientific articles from
01:36:56.320 anthropology geology when i studied
01:36:58.320 geology and astronomy in college so
01:37:00.880 you know i have some academic background
01:37:03.520 in that but
01:37:04.560 but you know basically what i have done
01:37:06.800 is tried to piece together
01:37:08.560 the big picture because early on i saw
01:37:11.199 nobody's doing that
01:37:12.719 no nobody's doing it really and some of
01:37:15.440 the guys that are out there doing it are
01:37:17.360 not
01:37:17.760 doing it with academic rigor you know
01:37:20.159 they're bringing in all kinds of weird
01:37:22.000 stuff
01:37:22.800 which makes it easy for the critics to
01:37:24.639 attack them and dismiss them as
01:37:26.560 fringe science they're throwing some woo
01:37:28.960 into the mix
01:37:29.679 they're throwing some woo into the mix
01:37:31.440 yeah in fact
01:37:33.280 the one of the
01:37:36.480 the the rational wiki uh entry on me
01:37:39.760 says something about
01:37:40.719 randall carlson and his woo and that's
01:37:42.880 all it says
01:37:44.320 you know so i took that as a sort of a
01:37:46.800 comment well people love to be able to
01:37:48.960 dismiss anything that's not mainstream
01:37:50.880 right that's outside yeah yeah
01:37:52.400 because there's this cult of authority
01:37:54.320 you know that's why you hear
01:37:55.520 somebody says well what does a real
01:37:56.880 scientist say about this what does a
01:37:58.560 real scientist say about this flood in
01:38:00.480 the mike
01:38:01.119 well which real scientist you know
01:38:04.159 uh vic baker richard waite uh you know
01:38:07.040 roy breckenridge you know i've i've read
01:38:09.199 or talked to every almost every
01:38:11.119 scientist that's done work on the
01:38:12.480 missoula flood
01:38:14.000 you know so i know what they're saying
01:38:16.239 and what they're thinking
01:38:17.360 you know and what they've written so so
01:38:19.920 you know when you say well what do the
01:38:20.960 real scientists say well
01:38:22.320 okay let's get a little more specific
01:38:23.840 who are you talking about because there
01:38:25.199 are different points of view
01:38:27.040 you know are you talking about john
01:38:28.560 shaw's idea are you talking about
01:38:30.960 you know victor baker's ideas or or or
01:38:34.400 any of the others well you know and
01:38:36.719 that's the thing they say that because
01:38:38.320 they don't really know they've got this
01:38:39.920 idea in your mind that there's this
01:38:41.440 authority
01:38:42.320 that's got it all explained which makes
01:38:44.800 it easy
01:38:45.520 right because if somebody's got it
01:38:46.800 explained then we don't need to concern
01:38:48.239 ourselves with it or think about it
01:38:49.760 right right so what i say is okay
01:38:53.840 forget about who says what let's just
01:38:56.000 look at the facts
01:38:57.679 let the facts dictate to us what the
01:39:00.800 meaning of all of this is
01:39:02.639 you know and let's look at all points of
01:39:04.639 view because that's what i try to do
01:39:06.880 you know i've got in my in my archives
01:39:08.960 here i've got you know not only
01:39:10.719 the the research that supports the idea
01:39:13.520 of
01:39:13.920 of a cosmic impact back during the
01:39:15.760 younger driest but the criticisms of it
01:39:18.239 as well
01:39:18.960 you know and i go okay how can we
01:39:20.400 explain those criticisms
01:39:22.000 and in the give and take of science
01:39:24.560 that's part of the process
01:39:26.719 you know that's how it evolves because
01:39:29.520 somebody puts out a new idea
01:39:31.920 you're supposed to attack it you know
01:39:33.920 and then if it withstands
01:39:36.000 the assault the onslaught that shows
01:39:38.719 that it's a credible idea
01:39:40.639 you know it's like a last man standing
01:39:42.400 sort of thing and i think that the
01:39:44.320 cosmic impact really is going to end up
01:39:46.000 being the last man standing
01:39:47.360 well it seems like there's so much
01:39:49.360 evidence that you're you're
01:39:50.639 you're bringing up that's so hard you
01:39:52.639 know the this the um
01:39:54.639 the how do you say that word chondrite
01:39:58.320 chondrite chondrite like mineral from
01:40:00.719 black matte
01:40:01.679 i mean all the the the various things
01:40:03.920 the micro diamonds the
01:40:05.600 nuclear glass the mass extinction events
01:40:09.199 the evidence of uh the uh flooding
01:40:12.960 warming the flooding the sea level rise
01:40:14.880 all of it all
01:40:15.679 all this conversion area yeah and this
01:40:18.639 this is basically saint chondrite
01:40:20.159 chondrites are a type of meteorite
01:40:22.239 so this is saying chondrite like
01:40:23.679 material in other words material that
01:40:25.360 would have had its origin in space
01:40:27.280 from the black matte now this black
01:40:28.880 matte is really interesting i'm going to
01:40:30.400 show you a couple of slides of it
01:40:31.679 because this black matte layer
01:40:33.840 it's black the reason it's black is
01:40:35.600 because it's so loaded with soot
01:40:38.000 and what is soot the result of fire
01:40:40.800 right
01:40:41.760 so let's let's go through here yeah this
01:40:43.840 discovery of a nano
01:40:45.119 diamond rich layer in the greenland ice
01:40:47.119 sheet so
01:40:48.159 nobody had looked but when these guys
01:40:50.400 richard firestone and james west and
01:40:52.320 james kenneth these other scientists
01:40:54.000 that are working on this
01:40:55.520 younger dryas impact hypothesis said to
01:40:58.239 their colleagues
01:40:59.280 check out the younger driest boundary
01:41:01.600 layer 12
01:41:02.560 900 years ago and see if there's
01:41:04.000 anything that shows up there
01:41:05.840 they did and what do you suppose they
01:41:07.040 found here it is right here a nano
01:41:09.119 diamond
01:41:09.760 rich layer so there it is showing up in
01:41:12.480 the ice sheets
01:41:13.679 here's new evidence from a black mat
01:41:15.760 site in the northern andes
01:41:17.600 supporting a cosmic impact twelve
01:41:19.679 thousand eight hundred years ago
01:41:22.159 uh very high temperature impact melt
01:41:25.119 products as evidence for cosmic air
01:41:27.199 bursts
01:41:27.679 impacts twelve thousand nine hundred so
01:41:30.320 that you know they haven't they're
01:41:31.119 they're getting closer and closer to
01:41:32.719 refining the date but it's coming in
01:41:34.560 twelve thousand eight hundred to twelve
01:41:35.920 thousand nine hundred years ago
01:41:38.080 um wildlife
01:41:41.280 wildfire and abrupt ecosystem disruption
01:41:44.320 on california's northern channel islands
01:41:47.199 at the allorod
01:41:48.320 younger driest boundary at basically
01:41:50.560 twelve thousand nine hundred
01:41:52.239 twelve point nine ka means twelve
01:41:54.719 thousand
01:41:55.280 nine hundred years ago k you know is the
01:41:57.840 universal
01:41:58.480 means a thousand that's great it's all
01:42:00.320 the same everything
01:42:01.600 keeps coming back the same date yeah
01:42:04.080 nano diamond rich layer across three
01:42:06.080 continents consistent
01:42:07.600 with major cosmic impact to 12 800
01:42:10.880 calendar years before present
01:42:14.719 evidence from central mexico supporting
01:42:16.639 the younger dryas extraterrestrial
01:42:18.560 impact hypothesis
01:42:21.119 evidence from northwestern venezuela and
01:42:23.119 andes for extraterrestrial impact
01:42:25.199 the black matte enigmas
01:42:28.320 evidence for deposition of 10 million
01:42:30.719 tons of
01:42:31.440 impact spirals across four continents 12
01:42:34.320 800 years ago
01:42:35.679 see it's coming in man it's coming in in
01:42:37.440 abundance and what's gratifying to me
01:42:40.159 is i theorize this 25 years ago wow
01:42:43.760 and it to see now the hard evidence
01:42:46.560 coming in
01:42:47.199 supporting a scenario i had pieced
01:42:49.440 together from all of these different
01:42:51.600 realms of knowledge is very gratifying
01:42:54.880 what was the seed in your mind that led
01:42:57.760 you
01:42:58.159 to be obsessed for a lack of a better
01:43:01.040 word
01:43:01.679 with this not only lack of a better word
01:43:03.440 i think it's pretty accurate right with
01:43:04.719 this subject
01:43:06.480 okay i guess it's time to come clean
01:43:10.000 i was on mushrooms i was on top of a
01:43:12.000 mountain well no you're actually pretty
01:43:13.920 close yeah
01:43:14.639 you are okay 1969.
01:43:19.119 oh that's a good year for mushrooms yeah
01:43:21.920 well it wasn't mushrooms but it was
01:43:23.760 something
01:43:24.239 in their family okay okay i'm going to a
01:43:27.679 rock concert
01:43:28.880 right in the beautiful summer day early
01:43:31.679 summer
01:43:32.080 12 up 12 900 years ago no
01:43:36.840 1969. right okay
01:43:39.440 so it's it's on a field next to a little
01:43:42.560 airport
01:43:43.360 in uh just out southwest of many the
01:43:46.080 twin cities minnesota which is near
01:43:47.760 where i grew up
01:43:48.719 okay the minnesota river flows through
01:43:51.520 there
01:43:52.159 right minnesota river flows into the
01:43:55.199 mississippi
01:43:57.040 i think i'll have some slides coming up
01:43:59.840 here i can maybe even show you
01:44:01.360 okay so what we have here is that
01:44:05.760 in the middle of this thing between
01:44:07.440 bands or whatever i wandered off from
01:44:09.760 the main
01:44:10.320 area where the where every the crowd was
01:44:12.639 gathered to listen to the music and i
01:44:14.080 walked over
01:44:14.960 to these 200 foot high bluffs
01:44:17.760 overlooking the valley of the missis
01:44:20.159 of the minnesota river now the minnesota
01:44:23.119 river
01:44:23.760 currently flows in a little channel at
01:44:26.000 the bottom of this valley
01:44:27.760 and i'm standing up on this hill and i'm
01:44:30.159 looking down
01:44:30.960 at this minnesota river you know
01:44:33.679 hundreds of feet below me in this
01:44:35.280 channel
01:44:36.719 and three miles four miles
01:44:40.000 across i see another set of bluffs
01:44:42.239 matching the ones that i'm standing on
01:44:45.280 and i had this all i can say is it was
01:44:47.600 kind of a revelation
01:44:48.960 that i'm looking down here at this
01:44:51.280 little river flowing in a channel
01:44:53.840 and then i'm seeing just a gigantic
01:44:56.239 version of that same channel
01:44:58.400 but it's three and four miles wide and i
01:45:01.360 i just looked at that and it was
01:45:03.360 almost as if for a short period of time
01:45:07.600 i got transplanted out of time or
01:45:10.639 something i don't know how to explain it
01:45:12.560 you can see this raging river i had this
01:45:15.360 sense that
01:45:16.080 this whole thing was a gigantic river
01:45:19.760 at one time i came away from that with
01:45:22.800 this
01:45:23.280 idea planted in the back of my brain and
01:45:25.600 it
01:45:26.320 bugged me for years after that right
01:45:29.760 and it was maybe five six years this is
01:45:32.239 now into the seventies
01:45:33.679 there was not a whole lot on
01:45:35.280 catastrophism available in the seventies
01:45:37.679 there was you know emanuel velikovsky
01:45:39.840 one of the forerunners but you know he
01:45:42.960 he came up with some really wild ideas
01:45:45.280 that made it very easy for mainstream
01:45:47.040 science to dismiss him
01:45:49.040 but he came up with some really solid
01:45:50.719 ideas too his book earth and upheaval
01:45:53.360 basically was just a documentation of
01:45:55.199 all of this geological evidence for
01:45:56.880 great catastrophes in the history of the
01:45:58.480 earth
01:45:59.520 i think he misinterpreted the cause of
01:46:01.679 those catastrophes but nonetheless
01:46:04.239 when you look at the criticisms you've
01:46:05.679 heard of emmanuel velikovsky right
01:46:07.360 velikov's thing i've heard it from you
01:46:09.360 okay well he was
01:46:10.960 famous best-selling author one of the
01:46:13.040 big best-selling authors of the 1950s
01:46:15.520 you know maybe in a sense a forerunner
01:46:17.760 of in fact graham
01:46:19.440 hancock has been compared to velikovsky
01:46:21.679 now and then i've
01:46:22.480 actually seen some of some of that
01:46:25.679 although velikovsky's work i don't think
01:46:28.480 was anywhere near as credible as
01:46:29.760 graham's
01:46:30.400 um graham is very uh very assiduous in
01:46:33.360 his
01:46:33.920 his referencing and his detailing and so
01:46:37.360 velikovsky went way off into this really
01:46:39.199 weird astrophysics to explain
01:46:41.440 his his theories of geological
01:46:43.840 catastrophe
01:46:44.800 which again allowed the critics to
01:46:46.560 basically dismiss everything he had done
01:46:48.639 so his but his book earth and upheaval i
01:46:50.880 think has upheld the test of time or
01:46:52.560 basically in the 1950s he was
01:46:54.800 accumulating all of this evidence
01:46:57.040 suggesting that um
01:46:58.560 there had been catastrophes in earth
01:47:00.000 history and was
01:47:01.840 like i said a bestseller but the
01:47:03.760 mainstream scientific community was very
01:47:06.000 dismissive of it okay and then
01:47:08.800 after that you had um a book called uh
01:47:11.920 uh by charles hapgood called the path of
01:47:15.119 the poll
01:47:15.920 i think it came out in 76. and he he and
01:47:18.880 there theorized that there had been a
01:47:20.239 sudden pole shift that had brought about
01:47:22.159 you know the
01:47:22.719 quick freezing of the mammoths and the
01:47:24.320 end of the ice age and so forth
01:47:26.480 um so you know i was familiar with that
01:47:28.800 stuff and i would i would read that
01:47:30.159 stuff
01:47:30.639 just out of curiosity you know um
01:47:33.360 because that was
01:47:34.239 some of the stuff that was out there and
01:47:35.600 and um you know somebody would say hey
01:47:37.920 did you read
01:47:38.639 velikovsky and so as i was reading this
01:47:40.400 stuff i would keep thinking back to this
01:47:42.800 image i'd had of this you know and then
01:47:45.840 in the early 80s i was talking to
01:47:47.760 somebody i actually gave one of my very
01:47:49.280 early lectures on this stuff and there
01:47:51.040 was a
01:47:51.679 somebody had a degree in geology who
01:47:53.600 stood up and he said
01:47:54.800 no no no that that valley that you're
01:47:57.440 talking about was created over millions
01:47:58.960 of years
01:48:00.400 i said i don't think so and we kind of
01:48:02.560 got into it a little bit and
01:48:04.000 but what that did was it kind of pissed
01:48:05.520 me off and i said okay i'm going to
01:48:07.440 research this thoroughly
01:48:09.040 and i did i thoroughly researched it i
01:48:11.600 went and i found
01:48:12.639 every single thing that had been written
01:48:14.239 on it and discovered that there's
01:48:16.000 actually mainstream geologists that have
01:48:17.840 said yeah
01:48:19.119 that river channel that giant river
01:48:21.520 channel was
01:48:22.159 actually created by a huge melt water
01:48:24.320 flood and they estimated that it's
01:48:26.560 volume they called it river warren
01:48:28.639 they estimated it as volume might have
01:48:30.239 been four thousand times greater
01:48:32.080 than the modern minnesota river that's
01:48:33.840 flowing in there so i felt very
01:48:35.760 vindicated from that and this was by the
01:48:37.520 early 80s
01:48:38.400 um so that was like one of the key
01:48:40.800 things there was other things you know i
01:48:42.320 am i spent the summer of 1970 mostly
01:48:45.760 sitting on a mountaintop in colorado
01:48:48.560 you know in a hut that i had built um
01:48:51.199 studying and reading stuff and
01:48:53.040 and traveling i you know this was back
01:48:54.800 in the days when you could
01:48:56.159 hitchhike and travel all over and i
01:48:58.159 think at one point i was with a buddy
01:48:59.679 and we were in his old
01:49:01.600 camper van and other times i was
01:49:03.040 hitchhiking but i spent the whole summer
01:49:05.600 traveling around the western states
01:49:09.600 and the thing i came away from that
01:49:11.520 summer with the you know i traveled the
01:49:13.280 first time i'd
01:49:14.000 traveled down to columbia gorge and as i
01:49:16.560 did i had this overwhelming sense
01:49:19.599 that there was something in the
01:49:21.040 landscape that i was that was
01:49:24.560 that was waiting to be revealed you know
01:49:26.800 i would look at these features
01:49:28.000 in the columbia gorge when i showed you
01:49:29.360 that huge that that waterfall with the
01:49:31.599 basalt over
01:49:32.480 that's in the columbia gorge so that was
01:49:34.639 the area i had traveled through in 1970
01:49:37.199 and i came away with that with this
01:49:38.719 sense that boy there's something
01:49:40.719 that that landscape is trying to tell me
01:49:43.599 and so
01:49:44.159 it goes back to that and i just you know
01:49:46.159 i got very interested in this stuff
01:49:48.400 um because i'm interested a in science
01:49:50.480 and i love the outdoors
01:49:52.480 so you know i love a good mystery you
01:49:54.719 know and i love
01:49:56.239 you know ancient traditions where sahala
01:49:58.400 sort of came together
01:50:00.239 over a period of you know a couple of
01:50:01.760 decades um
01:50:03.520 so i began really i would say
01:50:05.599 obsessively
01:50:06.719 really going into this um in the early
01:50:09.280 80s
01:50:10.000 you know where it went from just more or
01:50:12.159 less casual reading
01:50:13.599 into you know spending hours
01:50:16.880 in university libraries fi digging up
01:50:19.840 these things going back to the nine
01:50:21.760 going back like to the early geologists
01:50:24.560 to see what were they saying why did
01:50:26.080 they believe
01:50:27.599 that the history of the earth had been
01:50:28.960 catastrophic you know and um
01:50:31.599 and it just accelerated it doesn't seem
01:50:34.080 like
01:50:34.880 a ridiculous idea at all when you
01:50:36.560 consider what we see on the moon
01:50:38.480 the moon is so fascinating because we
01:50:40.320 can look right at it
01:50:41.760 there's no oceans there's no forests we
01:50:44.400 can see the evidence of impacts
01:50:46.320 all over it just completely covered
01:50:48.159 completely covered
01:50:49.360 with our minds living in this very small
01:50:52.159 window of
01:50:52.880 life you know if we're lucky we get a
01:50:54.719 hundred years and then of course you
01:50:56.320 know we have the history which goes back
01:50:58.080 to about seven
01:50:59.119 plus thousand years yeah just not enough
01:51:01.840 to really
01:51:03.199 to represent what we're looking at when
01:51:05.199 we look at the moon
01:51:06.400 we look at the moon this covered with
01:51:08.239 craters we're looking at potentially
01:51:11.280 billions of years of impacts yes and and
01:51:14.719 the assumption that those impacts ceased
01:51:18.400 hundreds of millions or billions of
01:51:19.840 years ago is clearly not correct well
01:51:22.159 there's no evidence that seized or why
01:51:24.080 it would cease
01:51:25.360 when we look at how many known
01:51:28.000 near-earth objects are floating around
01:51:30.639 oh in the last few years there's been
01:51:32.320 dozens of close flybys
01:51:34.480 there was one the other day that had a
01:51:35.920 [ __ ] moon yes
01:51:37.599 yes so something that flew by that had
01:51:41.040 its own moon yeah yeah that's wild
01:51:44.800 and and so think about this joe here's
01:51:47.040 what's happening
01:51:48.159 we've got geologists who are looking at
01:51:51.040 the crust of the earth
01:51:52.159 and discovering that yeah if we strip
01:51:54.159 away the biosphere and the oceans and
01:51:56.880 and account for plate tectonics the
01:51:59.040 earth is going to look like the moon
01:52:00.880 wow right there are now hundreds of
01:52:03.199 identified craters
01:52:04.400 right at the same time astronomers are
01:52:06.719 looking out into the near
01:52:08.400 space near earth neighborhood of space
01:52:10.639 and discovering
01:52:11.920 wait a second we assumed that you know
01:52:14.239 we were pretty much isolated that there
01:52:16.800 was nothing else going on we're now
01:52:18.080 realizing that near earth space is
01:52:19.920 densely populated the inner solar system
01:52:22.159 is densely
01:52:23.280 populated with cosmic debris
01:52:26.400 and this stuff is whizzing by us all the
01:52:28.480 time and it's
01:52:29.760 and now at the same time you've got
01:52:31.800 paleontologists
01:52:33.040 who are looking at the record of life
01:52:35.599 and realizing
01:52:36.719 that the record of life is not a smooth
01:52:39.520 curve
01:52:40.239 it's see-sawed you know life
01:52:42.639 proliferates and then suddenly
01:52:44.000 bam it's like the hammer comes down and
01:52:45.760 you have these mass extinction events
01:52:47.920 so this is our time right now but it
01:52:50.080 could very easily
01:52:51.520 end and there could be some new bug-like
01:52:54.159 creature that takes over
01:52:56.080 and becomes super smart a billion years
01:52:58.320 from now to me it all comes down to this
01:53:00.800 this to me is like okay
01:53:03.920 human species on planet earth it's time
01:53:05.840 for you to grow up and start paying
01:53:07.520 attention to the bigger picture because
01:53:09.280 whether you like it or not
01:53:10.960 you're a part of the bigger picture and
01:53:12.960 if we if we finally accept the fact that
01:53:15.280 maybe our predecessors have undergone
01:53:17.679 in a sense cultural mass extinctions you
01:53:20.719 know it suddenly
01:53:22.320 implies that we can't take our own
01:53:25.599 unending future for granted that we have
01:53:28.560 to we have to incorporate this bigger
01:53:30.480 picture into our thinking
01:53:32.239 and um you know the evidence is
01:53:35.040 continues to um
01:53:37.920 yes like here this was just from 2011
01:53:41.760 multiple lines of evidence for possible
01:53:44.320 human population decline
01:53:46.639 settlement reorganization during the
01:53:49.199 early younger driest
01:53:50.719 in the three years four years since this
01:53:52.560 was published more
01:53:54.239 evidence has emerged that yes the
01:53:57.599 the events that caused the mass
01:53:59.040 extinction of half the great mega
01:54:00.560 mammals on earth
01:54:02.320 did not leave the rest of the mammals
01:54:04.480 the rest of the animals unscathed
01:54:06.400 including humans
01:54:07.760 and there's now emerging evidence hard
01:54:09.599 scientific evidence that the human
01:54:11.199 population crashed
01:54:12.560 during the younger dryas so this would
01:54:15.920 completely
01:54:17.119 coincide with graham hancock's ideas
01:54:20.800 about the sphinx
01:54:22.400 the sphinx absolutely showing very clear
01:54:25.520 according to robert shock boston
01:54:27.599 university
01:54:28.639 geologist john anthony john anthony west
01:54:31.440 that there is
01:54:32.239 clear evidence of water erosion on the
01:54:34.320 sphinx which would indicate
01:54:36.480 thousands of years of rainfall where
01:54:39.440 there hasn't been rainfall in the nile
01:54:41.199 valley since like i believe it was 9000
01:54:43.199 bc
01:54:43.920 yeah so that's 11 000 years ago it's all
01:54:46.719 the same stuff
01:54:47.520 it's all the same stuff god this is
01:54:49.360 crazy
01:54:50.719 yeah we're we're on the verge of a
01:54:53.840 major paradigm shift and and
01:54:57.199 where it's going to go remains to be
01:54:58.560 seen we live in a shooting gallery
01:55:00.320 we live we listen it's not an
01:55:03.040 exaggeration to say that we
01:55:04.719 are sitting ducks in a cosmic shooting
01:55:06.639 gallery exactly
01:55:09.440 but the point is here's the point is
01:55:12.800 the only thing that's see it's like what
01:55:14.960 was it in the in the book of matthew
01:55:16.639 there's an interesting quote and i'm not
01:55:18.719 you know i'm not not thumping the bible
01:55:20.480 here but the bible is full of just like
01:55:22.159 all the traditions
01:55:24.400 of ages are gone the bible is full of
01:55:26.480 some very powerful interesting stuff
01:55:28.960 there's a part in here where one of the
01:55:30.239 disciples asked jesus about
01:55:32.000 when are we going to know about the end
01:55:34.320 of days
01:55:35.440 and he says well as it was in the days
01:55:37.760 of noah
01:55:38.719 when the people were eating and drinking
01:55:41.599 and marrying and giving in marriage
01:55:44.400 so will it be again in the days the end
01:55:47.360 of days
01:55:48.480 when the flood comes when the people
01:55:50.800 were eating and drinking marrying and
01:55:52.320 giving in marriage until the flood came
01:55:54.320 and swept them away
01:55:56.000 so will it be again at the end of days
01:55:58.639 so
01:55:59.119 what that seems to indicate to me is
01:56:00.639 that we just get
01:56:02.159 comfortable and relaxed and do well yeah
01:56:05.280 and when we do well that's when we get
01:56:06.719 hip better
01:56:07.440 it's it's not saying that the everyday
01:56:09.679 stuff the the stuff of everyday life
01:56:12.080 there's anything wrong it's not saying
01:56:13.440 that it's just saying
01:56:14.560 if we get so preoccupied with the
01:56:16.239 minutiae and the trivia of
01:56:17.920 everyday life to the exclusion of the
01:56:20.480 bigger picture
01:56:21.360 that's when we open ourselves up well
01:56:23.360 there's been i've had these weird
01:56:25.119 conversations with people about
01:56:26.639 me asteroidal impacts over the years
01:56:29.360 because i've before i even met you
01:56:31.199 i've been obsessed with this stuff not
01:56:33.280 nearly as much as when i met you in
01:56:35.119 atlanta and we started talking then i
01:56:36.639 got really into it
01:56:37.840 but what they would talk about the the
01:56:40.719 asteroids that killed the dinosaur oh
01:56:42.159 today we'd be able to stop that
01:56:43.920 and i'm like okay really is that true
01:56:46.400 and then i started looking into it well
01:56:47.760 what has been done is there's
01:56:49.280 nothing some [ __ ] theories see here
01:56:51.679 here's the thing
01:56:52.560 potentially yes we could someday we
01:56:55.119 could do it and really
01:56:57.040 you know within within a decade or two
01:56:59.040 yes we could we could do that
01:57:00.880 right now potentially but see what
01:57:03.040 happened on february 15th of 2014 when
01:57:06.000 that
01:57:06.560 little meteor came in and exploded over
01:57:08.400 chelyabinsk siberia
01:57:11.119 injured 1500 people now
01:57:14.400 you know and damaged thousands of
01:57:15.840 buildings that was a wake-up call
01:57:18.000 right that was a little speck that was a
01:57:20.320 little speck
01:57:21.199 now here's the thing if it had been a
01:57:23.280 little bigger
01:57:24.480 a little denser if it's an angle of
01:57:26.880 approach had been a little steeper
01:57:28.960 if its velocity had been a little bit
01:57:30.719 greater we might have been looking at
01:57:32.159 thousands of
01:57:33.119 of deaths rather than just injuries and
01:57:36.080 tunguska as you said
01:57:37.360 only a hundred and fifty foot wide only
01:57:40.159 150 foot wide object right
01:57:42.400 right so that's very very small in the
01:57:44.880 cosmic
01:57:45.920 room yeah well it's the building yeah
01:57:48.800 well from here to the front door
01:57:50.880 yeah you know i mean that's not that big
01:57:52.719 that's not that big what you've got
01:57:53.920 though is velocity
01:57:55.280 and you think like you know think of a
01:57:57.360 say a 38 slug
01:57:59.280 it's not big if i was to throw it at you
01:58:01.119 even as hard as i could it might sting a
01:58:02.880 little bit but it wouldn't do any damage
01:58:04.960 but if it came out of a gun with a
01:58:06.800 muzzle velocity of a thousand feet per
01:58:08.639 second think about that little thing and
01:58:10.159 what the damage it would do to you
01:58:11.840 yeah and see that's the thing about an
01:58:13.840 asteroid or a meteorite or a comet
01:58:15.760 coming in it's moving really really fast
01:58:19.199 you know so uh that's why like i said it
01:58:22.560 packs such a powerful kinetic punch
01:58:24.960 when it hits and some of them are even
01:58:26.880 made of iron
01:58:28.080 some of them are made of iron
01:58:32.719 so so if there's if there's a moral to
01:58:35.360 all of this
01:58:35.920 it's simply this look we are the one
01:58:38.480 species
01:58:39.599 that could prevent the type of mass
01:58:41.920 extinctions that have dominated the
01:58:43.840 biosphere of this planet for a couple of
01:58:45.760 hundred million years
01:58:46.800 or we could keep putting our resources
01:58:48.639 to fracking
01:58:50.000 yeah well i still haven't made up my
01:58:52.880 mind about fracking yet but you know i
01:58:54.960 do believe
01:58:55.760 that what we need to do is be thinking
01:58:58.639 of
01:58:59.199 if we're going to extract the resources
01:59:00.960 of this planet
01:59:02.719 let's do so in such a way that what
01:59:04.480 we're doing is
01:59:06.080 implementing the transcendence of human
01:59:08.480 culture
01:59:09.679 into the cosmos itself because i
01:59:11.280 ultimately believe that
01:59:12.960 is the destiny of terrestrial life is
01:59:14.960 that terrestrial life
01:59:16.400 wants to become cosmic it knows on some
01:59:19.679 level
01:59:20.400 that as long as life is confined to the
01:59:23.520 surface of a planet it's vulnerable
01:59:26.000 right and and you know it's without
01:59:28.080 getting into all of this there's
01:59:29.440 there's growing evidence you know that
01:59:30.880 life originally came to this planet from
01:59:33.199 space
01:59:34.159 right was seeded here probably through
01:59:36.480 comets
01:59:37.199 that carry organic material all the
01:59:39.360 spare panspermia exactly
01:59:41.599 um so here's the thing
01:59:44.719 you know if you're an environmentalist
01:59:47.040 and rightfully critical of some of the
01:59:48.800 things that humans are doing to to
01:59:50.639 to disrupt the environment you gotta
01:59:53.280 though place in context the fact that
01:59:55.360 nature itself
01:59:56.400 has done things to the environment so
01:59:59.280 that so far exceed anything we have done
02:00:01.280 yet
02:00:02.320 what i showed you with that slide
02:00:03.920 showing the ice sheets over
02:00:05.840 canada think about this suppose some
02:00:09.520 logging company got a contract from the
02:00:12.080 government
02:00:12.800 u.s and canadian governments to
02:00:14.719 clear-cut
02:00:15.840 every forest from like the 47th parallel
02:00:19.119 up to the arctic circle from the
02:00:20.560 atlantic to the pacific we're going to
02:00:21.920 cut
02:00:22.320 every single tree from the northern
02:00:24.880 united states up to
02:00:26.880 the tree line in in northern canada
02:00:29.199 we're going to cut
02:00:29.920 billions of trees billions of board feet
02:00:32.320 we're going to clear cut
02:00:33.280 every single tree we would rightfully be
02:00:35.920 up in arms and say no you're not going
02:00:37.440 to do that
02:00:38.320 right well what do you think that ice
02:00:40.159 did
02:00:41.360 it wiped out you know there's evidence
02:00:43.440 now that 35 and 40 000 years ago there
02:00:45.840 were forests growing up there
02:00:48.000 right a few thousand years later the ice
02:00:51.280 has bulldozed everything there's no
02:00:52.960 forests growing under two miles of ice
02:00:55.440 right imagine if we said well we're
02:00:58.000 going to just
02:00:59.040 decimate the shallow marine ecologies
02:01:01.280 we're going to go in there and we're
02:01:02.159 going to just wipe out the coral reefs
02:01:03.920 we're going to overfish until there's no
02:01:05.679 nothing nothing left of the shallow
02:01:07.599 marine college ecologies
02:01:09.599 less than 400 feet you know below sea
02:01:12.239 level
02:01:13.199 well what do you think a drop in 400
02:01:15.199 feet of 400 feet in the sea level did
02:01:17.599 to the shallow marine ecologies to the
02:01:20.560 coral reefs that we're growing there
02:01:22.480 you see that's what i'm just saying it's
02:01:25.119 not to justify
02:01:26.480 that we can ransack nature willy-nilly
02:01:29.440 but it's to say we have to have a
02:01:31.440 realistic context for thinking about
02:01:33.360 this
02:01:33.920 and bear in mind the the environmental
02:01:36.960 movement
02:01:37.520 was born during an era of total
02:01:40.560 gradualistic dominance in the 50s and
02:01:43.119 60s if you go back then
02:01:45.280 again only the fringe the the the you
02:01:47.760 know this
02:01:48.480 the the fringe sciences people like
02:01:51.520 velikovsky and others
02:01:53.040 were talking about catastrophes the
02:01:55.280 assumption was is that all global change
02:01:57.520 occurred one grain of sand or
02:01:59.360 one drop of water at a time right well
02:02:02.480 we've come 180 degrees from that model
02:02:05.679 of earth history
02:02:06.960 but our thinking has not really evolved
02:02:09.760 to
02:02:10.080 to to incorporate such a dynamic planet
02:02:13.679 you know at this point now see so when
02:02:15.840 the environmental movement was born it
02:02:18.080 was easy to think that
02:02:19.280 if if all change had happened at this
02:02:22.000 imperceptibly slow rate
02:02:23.599 yeah obviously then humans have
02:02:25.440 accelerated that pace of change and
02:02:27.040 humans are now contributing
02:02:28.800 to you know more global change than than
02:02:30.800 we've seen in millions of years
02:02:33.119 if that uniformitarian or gradualistic
02:02:35.840 model was correct
02:02:37.119 but it's not and i'm afraid that there's
02:02:40.639 a large faction of the environmental
02:02:42.320 movement that's still
02:02:43.679 locked into that thinking of a
02:02:47.040 gradual evolution of the planet one
02:02:50.000 grain of water
02:02:50.960 one drop of water one grain of sand at a
02:02:52.880 time and it has not suffered
02:02:55.280 any kind of disruption until we bad
02:02:57.840 humans came along
02:02:59.119 and started you know with our factories
02:03:02.239 and our oil wells and
02:03:03.599 our suvs and everything else
02:03:07.440 but you know clearly we have to come to
02:03:09.280 terms with the fact that we live on one
02:03:11.199 hell of a dynamic planet
02:03:12.800 and one hell of a dynamic solar system
02:03:14.800 one hell of a diamond without jupiter
02:03:16.400 right we'd be
02:03:17.199 [ __ ] a long time we would be somebody
02:03:19.440 said they wanted to hear me say the word
02:03:20.960 [ __ ] at least
02:03:21.760 once um
02:03:25.360 so i'll throw i'll go ahead and throw it
02:03:26.719 yeah we would be [ __ ] jupiter is the
02:03:28.800 big kind
02:03:29.760 like the the bouncer for all the the
02:03:32.880 bigger asteroids it gets sucked in
02:03:34.560 well jupiter can play a dual role see
02:03:37.760 jupiter can act as a as yeah the bouncer
02:03:40.320 that that kicks
02:03:41.599 a lot of those guys back out you know
02:03:43.679 back out into the kuiper disk or
02:03:45.199 wherever they came from or from
02:03:47.360 but it can also hurtle stuff in
02:03:50.719 towards us it can do either one sacred
02:03:53.760 geometry is a subject that i wanted to
02:03:55.599 talk to you about
02:03:56.400 because we we could go on about
02:03:58.960 cataclysmic
02:04:00.079 impacts forever but it's one of the
02:04:02.079 things that you mentioned at the end of
02:04:03.440 our last podcast that you wanted to talk
02:04:05.280 about on this one
02:04:06.480 yeah um and it's the name of your
02:04:10.079 organization sacred geometry well it's
02:04:12.239 the name of the website
02:04:13.360 um yeah i could find some stuff here to
02:04:16.560 show you about that and
02:04:17.599 it dovetails because remember we're
02:04:19.840 talking here a lot about
02:04:20.960 geology geometry right they both
02:04:24.639 are sciences that have evolved out of
02:04:26.719 the study of the earth
02:04:28.560 and uh you know one of the things that
02:04:31.199 i've done
02:04:31.760 is is you know in geology we have this
02:04:33.920 thing called scale and variance
02:04:36.079 which is that if you look at a
02:04:37.040 geological picture you're always going
02:04:39.040 to see
02:04:40.000 somebody you're going to see like a rock
02:04:41.840 pick set in the picture
02:04:43.360 you're going to see a person standing
02:04:45.360 there because oftentimes
02:04:46.800 you don't have a sense of the scale of
02:04:48.079 what you're looking at right if
02:04:51.199 and in geometry we have the same
02:04:53.440 phenomena it's also kind of the modern
02:04:55.199 term for it is fractalization
02:04:56.960 where the part looks the the smaller
02:04:59.760 part looks like the bigger hole and
02:05:01.040 that's one of the basic
02:05:02.239 working ideas of sacred geometry and
02:05:05.599 it's the same idea of what i was
02:05:07.360 describing
02:05:08.320 standing there looking into the
02:05:09.840 minnesota river valley
02:05:11.679 this was an example of scale in variance
02:05:14.239 that
02:05:15.119 you had the same that the big channel
02:05:17.119 was just a much much
02:05:18.719 larger version of this small channel and
02:05:21.119 that if you didn't have a scale of
02:05:22.560 reference
02:05:23.360 you couldn't tell really what you're
02:05:25.280 looking at how how big or how small it
02:05:27.360 is see
02:05:28.320 so in the study of sacred geometry one
02:05:30.800 of the fundamental ideas is this idea of
02:05:32.880 scale and variance so
02:05:34.400 when i first was interested in geometry
02:05:37.199 because
02:05:38.000 geometry i think is one of the keys to
02:05:40.560 deciphering many of the ancient
02:05:41.920 traditions like
02:05:43.280 you know i became a somebody wanted me
02:05:44.960 to talk about freemasonry and i
02:05:46.719 you know can talk about that up to a
02:05:48.079 certain extent you know i
02:05:50.239 you know one of the things that that i
02:05:53.040 learned as soon as
02:05:53.920 actually i think i learned it before i
02:05:55.119 was actually initiated into the masonic
02:05:57.440 fraternity in 1978
02:05:59.679 was that at the core of all the masonic
02:06:02.000 symbolism was geometry
02:06:04.079 if you wanted to understand the message
02:06:06.000 of the great cathedrals
02:06:07.599 you had to have geometry if you wanted
02:06:09.599 to understand
02:06:10.800 the the the this amazing plethora of
02:06:13.760 symbolism
02:06:14.639 that is of which masons are the
02:06:17.199 custodians
02:06:18.400 you had to study geometry and
02:06:20.719 secondarily you had to study astronomy
02:06:23.040 so that sort of confirmed some of the
02:06:25.679 ideas i had already been thinking at the
02:06:27.679 time that i went in
02:06:28.960 in the late 70s freemasonry is
02:06:32.719 full of symbolism why did you join the
02:06:34.800 freemasons
02:06:35.920 well you know because for one thing i've
02:06:37.920 always loved our you know i come from a
02:06:39.440 family of builders
02:06:40.880 i build things for a living that's what
02:06:42.560 i do i design things
02:06:44.000 and i build things for a living that's
02:06:45.440 what i how i make my money
02:06:47.199 so i was always interested in the built
02:06:49.599 environment
02:06:50.560 and somewhere along the line i just
02:06:52.719 began to realize that there was a whole
02:06:54.239 lot more to the built environment of
02:06:56.000 ancient times
02:06:57.520 that in modern times you look at
02:06:59.920 architecture
02:07:00.719 and that architecture is not necessarily
02:07:03.679 symbolical
02:07:04.800 except on a very abstract sense i became
02:07:07.520 aware of the fact that the ancient
02:07:09.119 architecture the ancient structures
02:07:10.480 whether it's the pyramids of giza or
02:07:12.159 stonehenge or angkor wat or the mayan
02:07:14.719 temples
02:07:15.920 they're all profoundly symbolic
02:07:19.280 they're not just built because hey it
02:07:22.159 looks good
02:07:22.960 no it's they convey information
02:07:26.560 um you know cathedrals it was victor
02:07:28.800 hugo who referred to some of the great
02:07:30.639 cathedrals as being
02:07:31.760 literal textbooks in stone and that's
02:07:34.639 what they are
02:07:35.520 shark cathedral beautiful example of a
02:07:37.760 textbook in stone
02:07:39.440 and and uh i have i don't know if you've
02:07:42.719 ever been
02:07:43.360 to any of the cathedrals no that's
02:07:46.079 something you need to put on your bucket
02:07:47.599 list joe
02:07:48.560 yeah i'm planning on going to europe
02:07:50.239 this summer so when i do
02:07:52.079 uh on a vacation instead of working yeah
02:07:54.560 that's
02:07:55.280 yeah make it a research vacation it'll
02:07:57.520 make it a lot more interesting and
02:07:58.719 before you go
02:07:59.760 have kids it's tough to do a lot of
02:08:01.679 research we've got little kids that get
02:08:03.199 bored real easy but i'm gonna check some
02:08:04.719 [ __ ] out yeah check check some [ __ ] out
02:08:06.480 you know
02:08:07.760 i can send you some places that that i
02:08:10.000 don't know about your kids but i could
02:08:11.360 easily have been eight years old and
02:08:12.480 been totally blown away by
02:08:13.920 okay you know well one of the things
02:08:16.000 about
02:08:17.040 the freemasons the idea of the
02:08:18.719 freemasons is
02:08:20.159 that it's a secret society yeah and
02:08:22.400 there's a secret you know and people
02:08:24.320 associate it with the illuminati and the
02:08:27.119 people that control the world
02:08:28.800 and don't i wish but
02:08:32.000 you know joe i think i would love to be
02:08:34.000 the dick dick supreme dictator of the
02:08:35.920 world
02:08:36.639 really what would you do differently uh
02:08:38.960 differently
02:08:41.199 we could get in that's going to be yeah
02:08:42.639 that's a five-hour budget yeah that's a
02:08:44.079 different podcast
02:08:45.040 right um the but
02:08:48.800 when you say like uh i'm a mason people
02:08:51.199 would automatically
02:08:52.320 you know especially ignorant people
02:08:53.760 would automatically assume that you're a
02:08:55.520 part of some sort of society
02:08:57.679 that's victimizing the general
02:09:00.320 population and you're
02:09:02.079 involved with the people that put the
02:09:04.000 eyeball on top of the pyramid that's on
02:09:06.000 the dollar bill
02:09:07.119 and you're you know i don't even know
02:09:09.840 where to start with some of that
02:09:11.119 are there secrets in the freemasons were
02:09:13.119 you not allowed to talk about it
02:09:14.400 well bear in mind now secrets
02:09:17.520 you know in in the middle ages there
02:09:19.199 were trade secrets
02:09:21.199 and you know uh building secrets clearly
02:09:23.920 you know
02:09:24.560 um and when you went through the process
02:09:27.599 of initiation you learned about these
02:09:29.360 secrets
02:09:30.159 right but it's it's not that really that
02:09:32.960 different the idea than say modern
02:09:34.719 uh you know uh commercial or industrial
02:09:37.599 secrets
02:09:38.159 you know coke has it keeps it formula
02:09:40.880 secret
02:09:41.440 right right and it's done so for a
02:09:42.719 hundred years right
02:09:44.480 but the thing was is you got to realize
02:09:47.280 that freemasonry became an outlawed
02:09:49.040 organization
02:09:50.560 right during the middle ages when the
02:09:52.880 church was persecuting
02:09:54.480 anybody who was branded a heretic which
02:09:57.280 could have meant
02:09:58.239 anything that they wanted to be
02:10:00.639 freemasonry had to go underground
02:10:02.880 and that's the primary reason for the
02:10:05.360 secrecy
02:10:06.159 um is because it was a survival strategy
02:10:10.320 and it only re-emerged in the early
02:10:12.079 1700s with the consolidation
02:10:14.000 of four lodges in britain to become the
02:10:16.880 modern institution freemason
02:10:19.280 and you know to anybody who comes up
02:10:20.719 with that i would just challenge them
02:10:21.840 show me the hard evidence show me that
02:10:23.440 you know
02:10:24.000 i like to say that well yeah i'll admit
02:10:26.000 you know 14 of the american presidents
02:10:28.000 have been freemasons but 22 of them were
02:10:30.560 episcopalians
02:10:31.840 so clearly that implies to me that it's
02:10:33.599 the episcopalians who are the puppet
02:10:35.360 masters ruling the world
02:10:36.880 right if you want to make that argument
02:10:39.760 well why
02:10:40.400 were they freemasons like what's the
02:10:42.079 benefits of being a freemason
02:10:43.920 well for one thing what you're doing is
02:10:46.000 you're aligning yourself
02:10:47.360 with probably the oldest institution
02:10:49.520 that still exists on the planet
02:10:51.280 that goes back now we can historically
02:10:53.280 trace it back to the middle ages
02:10:55.280 but if you go back further than that
02:10:57.760 while the historical continuity
02:11:00.239 breaks down we can go back and we can
02:11:02.719 talk about the coma chains in italy we
02:11:05.119 can talk about the martinis
02:11:06.639 we can talk about the um the mithraeus
02:11:10.000 tradition we can talk about the
02:11:11.440 mysteries of egypt
02:11:13.199 uh we can talk about the the zoroastrian
02:11:15.920 tradition
02:11:16.880 um the list goes on the elusinian
02:11:19.199 mysteries and what we see
02:11:20.639 is a structure of initiation that's
02:11:22.400 virtually identical in all these cases
02:11:24.560 to what modern freemasonry is
02:11:27.040 and um with modern freemasonry basically
02:11:31.199 you know you have a whole cross-section
02:11:33.520 of individuals that join who
02:11:35.199 who a lot of them join simply because
02:11:37.679 hey my dad was a freemason or my uncle
02:11:39.920 it was a family tradition
02:11:41.440 so that's why i joined others joined
02:11:43.840 because freemasons raised every year
02:11:45.599 raised
02:11:46.000 millions of dollars for charity mostly
02:11:49.119 for children's charitable causes you
02:11:51.599 know they run the
02:11:52.639 uh scottish right hospital for crippled
02:11:54.639 and burned children they run eye
02:11:56.159 hospitals and
02:11:57.280 you know children that need medical care
02:12:00.239 they can go to these hospitals
02:12:02.079 and not have to pay anything so their
02:12:04.639 their fraternal organization they're one
02:12:06.159 of the largest charitable organizations
02:12:08.000 on the planet in terms of the money that
02:12:09.599 they raise
02:12:10.480 you know again jesus said you by their
02:12:12.960 by their works ye shall know them
02:12:14.800 you know um you know you can
02:12:17.840 twist that around perversely twist that
02:12:20.000 around and say that's some kind of
02:12:21.280 nefarious strategy to
02:12:22.960 you know whatever get control the other
02:12:25.199 side of the equation is that they're
02:12:26.639 also custodians
02:12:27.920 of this body of ancient symbolism where
02:12:31.199 all of these things that we have been
02:12:32.719 talking about uh
02:12:34.480 basically are encoded um and
02:12:38.000 and i could pull up some interesting
02:12:40.000 stuff here that you you know that you
02:12:41.599 could
02:12:42.159 could look at to see um what we're
02:12:45.199 actually talking about there but
02:12:46.800 but yeah they have this amazing body of
02:12:49.760 symbolism let me let me pull it here's
02:12:51.440 an example of a masonic
02:12:53.040 apron okay let's take a look at this
02:12:56.480 we'll zoom in here
02:12:58.639 and what do you see right at the very
02:13:00.800 center of this
02:13:02.159 symbol symbolical array what do you what
02:13:04.800 is that
02:13:06.800 i think it's a barn it's not a bar it's
02:13:09.040 not the ark it's the ark
02:13:11.040 it's you know it's probably it's noah's
02:13:12.480 ark because noah's ark so that's the
02:13:14.400 so that's supposed to be the ocean
02:13:15.679 around it it's floating in the waters of
02:13:18.079 the great flood
02:13:19.040 and and if you look closely i know it's
02:13:20.560 hard to tell but growing out of here
02:13:22.320 it's a chicken no it's an acacia
02:13:25.520 the occasion it's a masonic symbol for
02:13:29.040 rebirth regeneration rejuvenation so the
02:13:32.400 idea here is that in that
02:13:34.000 arc has preserved all of the seeds the
02:13:37.040 biological diversity of the world that
02:13:39.440 is now being erased from the planet by
02:13:41.199 the waters of the flood
02:13:42.400 the acacia is it related to the acacia
02:13:44.800 tree or the acacia bush is it the same
02:13:46.719 sort of thing yeah
02:13:47.760 you know that's the same bush that they
02:13:49.440 believe is responsible for moses having
02:13:51.679 the visions
02:13:53.040 of god so what are giving him the ten
02:13:56.239 commandments because the acacia
02:13:58.000 bush is rich in dimethyltryptamine ah
02:14:01.520 the flaming bush this being symbolic of
02:14:05.040 somehow another extracting the dmt from
02:14:08.000 that
02:14:08.800 smoking it or lighting it on fire and
02:14:11.920 that being the transmission method for
02:14:13.760 the dimethyltryptamine which of course
02:14:15.599 is one of the most profound psychedelic
02:14:17.360 experiences
02:14:18.239 and gives people this feeling of being
02:14:21.040 in contact with the divine
02:14:23.440 now do you think it's any coincidence
02:14:25.360 that the freemasons have
02:14:26.880 venerated the acacia for hundreds of
02:14:28.960 years it makes a lot of sense it makes a
02:14:30.639 lot of sense doesn't it yeah
02:14:32.400 yeah well there's modern-day scholars
02:14:34.800 who are looking at this
02:14:36.400 the story of moses and connecting it to
02:14:38.480 some sort of a psychedelic trip
02:14:40.400 yeah here is which is another thing
02:14:43.599 that's slowly
02:14:45.199 being exonerated today those ideas are
02:14:47.440 being vindicated today
02:14:49.199 yeah that before you know you would say
02:14:51.440 just a few decades ago that somehow or
02:14:53.199 another moses was on drugs
02:14:54.719 like get the [ __ ] out of here yeah and
02:14:56.480 people would just and any
02:14:58.960 real legitimate sort of uh stories being
02:15:02.159 connected to psychedelic drugs people
02:15:03.920 would think of as being preposterous and
02:15:05.679 now
02:15:06.320 it's more and more accepted every day
02:15:08.079 right simply because
02:15:09.840 the evidence is accumulation it's
02:15:11.119 overwhelming the election there's no
02:15:12.960 question that in the alessinian
02:15:14.320 mysteries they were imbibing some type
02:15:16.000 of a consciousness altering
02:15:17.679 substance i think that there's no
02:15:19.040 question during the mithraic mysteries
02:15:20.800 also they were they don't know what that
02:15:24.000 was though right
02:15:24.719 not exactly unless you you know i think
02:15:26.639 um who was it maybe albert hoffman and a
02:15:29.520 couple others
02:15:30.239 they they wrote a book in the 70s on the
02:15:33.280 yellowstone mysteries where they were
02:15:34.800 talking about that and i read it so long
02:15:36.320 ago i've kind of forgotten
02:15:38.960 what their what their final conclusion
02:15:41.360 was but it was definitely that they were
02:15:42.880 doing some type of a psychedelic potion
02:15:44.880 believe in
02:15:45.520 soma when you go back to yeah the
02:15:47.840 ancient hindus the soma being
02:15:50.320 some sort of a mystery concoction they
02:15:52.639 don't know what it was but
02:15:54.320 most likely had some sort of psychedelic
02:15:57.119 properties too because they don't know
02:15:58.400 what it was
02:15:59.119 they don't know exactly what it was this
02:16:00.480 is amazing when you consider the fact
02:16:02.239 that
02:16:02.639 this stuff was so profound so important
02:16:05.599 to them
02:16:06.320 and now we don't even know what was in
02:16:08.159 it most likely some concoction with
02:16:11.360 probably included psychedelic mushrooms
02:16:14.320 yeah
02:16:15.040 well i'm convinced that you know one of
02:16:17.119 the that one of the great boons to
02:16:19.040 humankind is
02:16:20.239 psychedelics and it was a profound
02:16:22.960 mistake to criminalize it when we should
02:16:24.800 have venerated it as ancient cultures
02:16:26.800 did and provided a
02:16:28.239 context in which people could do it with
02:16:30.719 wisdom
02:16:31.280 you know and propriety rather than
02:16:33.120 driving it underground you know turning
02:16:35.040 it into a
02:16:35.679 criminal enterprise that has been i
02:16:37.359 think enormously had enormous
02:16:39.599 destructive consequences for our society
02:16:41.920 by by criminalizing this for the last
02:16:43.920 half century
02:16:44.799 yeah well most certainly and you can see
02:16:46.398 the difference in the art of the 1960s
02:16:48.558 especially when
02:16:49.280 it comes to music the difference between
02:16:50.799 the 60s and the 70s
02:16:52.398 the shallow nature of a lot of the music
02:16:54.240 that came out of the 70s and the disco
02:16:56.240 and all that stuff
02:16:57.280 and then look at what was going on the
02:16:58.558 60s with hendricks and yeah jim morrison
02:17:01.679 most likely psychedelic related oh of
02:17:04.240 course it was
02:17:05.200 yeah yeah of course led zeppelin the
02:17:07.200 beatles yeah the profound change in the
02:17:09.120 music of the beatles once they
02:17:10.240 discovered the lsd
02:17:12.160 oh it inspired an enormous burst of
02:17:15.120 creativity
02:17:16.318 what's really interesting that what
02:17:17.599 we're seeing now is huge benefits in
02:17:20.398 psychedelic therapy for people with
02:17:22.638 post-traumatic stress disorder right
02:17:24.879 and it's out of war that we're finding
02:17:27.840 these
02:17:28.558 therapies for people that went to war
02:17:31.359 and these therapies the best ones
02:17:33.840 are psychedelics yeah which is really
02:17:36.000 amazing well you know in my own case you
02:17:38.000 know i basically went from
02:17:39.599 essentially being a juvenile delinquent
02:17:41.519 to the quest for god in one weekend
02:17:44.318 after my first
02:17:46.718 basically so wow
02:17:50.558 it was that that quick a lot of people
02:17:53.120 have had the same story i mean
02:17:54.558 terence mckenna spoke of his uh one of
02:17:57.519 his trips to the jungle
02:17:59.200 being that he was this sort of narrative
02:18:01.040 well just couldn't get it together
02:18:02.799 and then he came out of it the
02:18:04.160 psychedelic shaman who had this intense
02:18:06.718 desire to spread the word
02:18:08.080 yeah yeah yep so
02:18:11.439 yeah and i think it's we're definitely
02:18:13.760 moving in the right direction i just
02:18:15.439 it's of course you know
02:18:17.040 for me i'm impatient i want to see it
02:18:18.879 move a lot faster i want to see us just
02:18:21.519 end this ridiculous drug war yeah you
02:18:23.920 know and and yeah of course there's
02:18:25.599 going to be a downside to it there's
02:18:27.280 downside to everything you know and but
02:18:30.000 the upside is so substantive the upside
02:18:32.080 is so substantial and the downside of it
02:18:34.240 is minuscule compared to the downside of
02:18:36.398 the drug war itself
02:18:37.599 not only that how about the drugs that
02:18:39.200 we already have that are legal that
02:18:41.760 those drugs that are sanctioned are the
02:18:43.200 worst ones worse ones yeah
02:18:45.840 we're not going to have a drug free
02:18:47.599 society i've had dr carl hart
02:18:49.920 on the podcast who's an expert in this
02:18:52.000 has written
02:18:53.439 some uh pretty uh amazing stuff on it
02:18:56.000 and one of the things that he said is
02:18:57.280 not only do we not
02:18:58.718 want a drug free culture we've never had
02:19:02.240 one
02:19:02.799 right no one has ever had this idea of a
02:19:04.879 drug free culture they've never existed
02:19:07.200 right once people figured out a way to
02:19:09.599 perturb their normal states of
02:19:11.120 consciousness and the benefits of that
02:19:12.478 whether it's alcohol
02:19:13.679 or psychedelics or whatever it's been
02:19:15.519 even yoga and meditation you're
02:19:17.040 essentially
02:19:18.160 you're you're stimulating endogenous
02:19:20.558 drugs yes
02:19:21.519 yes and and see here's the thing it's
02:19:23.599 somebody brought this up i don't
02:19:24.959 remember who it might have been somebody
02:19:26.318 like richard albert or something back in
02:19:28.080 the day
02:19:28.799 saying that you know you can go you can
02:19:30.718 embark on a quest
02:19:32.959 for spiritual enlightenment and mystical
02:19:35.439 at one minute right
02:19:36.799 through through this arduous program of
02:19:39.040 of yoga and meditation and
02:19:41.200 and all of that and it'll take you years
02:19:44.000 but
02:19:44.638 who is going to embark upon such a
02:19:46.398 program not really knowing
02:19:48.080 that the end of it is this ecstatic
02:19:50.800 mystical union with
02:19:52.560 the godhead right well they said that
02:19:55.920 basically
02:19:56.640 nature's provided shortcuts so that you
02:19:59.359 know we could actually see
02:20:01.040 what the goal of it was and know that
02:20:03.920 yeah at the end of this
02:20:05.200 process that might take you 10 years or
02:20:07.600 five years or whatever
02:20:09.040 depending on your dedication there is
02:20:11.760 this
02:20:12.160 all this experience of your
02:20:13.600 consciousness expanding
02:20:15.200 into these ecstatic states agents of
02:20:17.600 evolution as it were and
02:20:19.280 that's the thing that people i think
02:20:22.080 universally
02:20:23.040 feel from psychedelic experiences is
02:20:25.359 that it allows you to get over
02:20:27.840 a lot of these sort of built-in
02:20:31.120 instincts that we have from our
02:20:33.040 thousands of years of evolution
02:20:35.439 and the the time that we're essentially
02:20:38.399 living
02:20:38.880 like wild animals i mean those those
02:20:41.280 genes
02:20:42.080 are still in our system and we have all
02:20:44.800 these
02:20:45.680 ideas of paranoia and fear
02:20:48.720 and ego and the you know jealousy and
02:20:52.000 all these different things that allowed
02:20:53.280 us
02:20:53.680 to be ultra competitive which allowed us
02:20:55.760 to innovate at a faster rate which
02:20:58.240 allowed us to get to where we are in
02:20:59.680 2015 but those things are kind of
02:21:01.920 hampering us
02:21:02.800 yeah because we're outgrowing the monkey
02:21:05.280 body
02:21:06.000 it's like you know if we're gonna travel
02:21:08.319 to um
02:21:09.280 we want to travel to europe right you
02:21:11.439 can't drive there in a car you can go
02:21:13.120 drive from here to the east coast but
02:21:14.800 once you get to the coastline you have
02:21:16.240 to get out of the car and get into a
02:21:17.600 different vehicle
02:21:18.880 right because if you keep driving in the
02:21:20.479 same car you're gonna go into the ocean
02:21:22.319 and you're gonna drown
02:21:23.359 right we're kind of like that in the
02:21:25.680 sense that you know
02:21:27.200 see i think that war was perhaps
02:21:29.760 inevitable
02:21:30.479 you know this this because it's em
02:21:31.920 embedded in our consciousness you see
02:21:34.240 i just showed you here evidence that the
02:21:35.920 human population crashed
02:21:37.920 coming out of the younger dryas well
02:21:40.160 what's ironic is that
02:21:41.520 after the after the ice age was over for
02:21:44.319 about three or four thousand years from
02:21:46.240 six thousand to about nine thousand
02:21:48.399 nine thousand five hundred years ago
02:21:50.720 what we had was a period
02:21:52.080 known as the climatic optimum by the
02:21:54.960 scientists who've looked at it
02:21:56.479 in which some of the estimates are that
02:21:58.479 global average climate might have been
02:22:00.080 two to four degrees warmer than now
02:22:02.479 what that meant was that you had a much
02:22:05.520 longer growing season and
02:22:07.120 anybody who doubts this please do your
02:22:08.640 own research or i can post
02:22:10.399 all kinds of stuff online that anybody
02:22:12.479 who's not immediately
02:22:14.080 you know you know
02:22:17.760 can't handle this this can kind of
02:22:19.520 information anybody who's open-minded
02:22:21.120 can actually go and do their homework
02:22:22.560 and see that the
02:22:23.359 the climate climatic optimum is well
02:22:25.920 documented
02:22:27.040 and for about three to four thousand
02:22:28.960 years
02:22:30.319 basically we were living in an almost
02:22:33.240 quasi-paradisial state
02:22:34.880 almost a garden of eden like it was
02:22:36.960 almost like after the traumatic
02:22:38.720 birth of this modern age the holocene
02:22:41.760 that we're in
02:22:42.800 it's like nature just sort of was this
02:22:46.319 nurturing environment it was during this
02:22:49.280 period
02:22:50.160 that humans were worshiping the earth in
02:22:52.319 the form of this
02:22:53.600 corpulent pregnant goddess right it's
02:22:56.640 been called the goddess civilization by
02:22:58.560 maria gimboutus who was the
02:23:00.160 archaeologist who did all of this work
02:23:02.399 and what was interesting if you look
02:23:03.680 into her work is that during this period
02:23:06.080 of the
02:23:06.479 of the early neolithic in the
02:23:08.560 archaeological terminology
02:23:11.040 there's no evidence that of any warfare
02:23:13.840 there's no evidence that people
02:23:15.359 you know looking at at the the carvings
02:23:18.479 that people did the the the artwork that
02:23:20.399 people did
02:23:21.359 looking at the communities there were
02:23:22.960 not stockades like there were later
02:23:25.359 there was no evidence um in the in the
02:23:28.560 archaeological record of you know
02:23:30.840 weaponization
02:23:32.399 and it makes sense because in the
02:23:35.040 aftermath
02:23:35.840 of this extreme event that ended the ice
02:23:38.479 age what you had was
02:23:39.920 huge areas of the planet that were
02:23:42.240 depopulated
02:23:44.000 nature quickly begins to reclaim um
02:23:47.200 and what you now have is you have this
02:23:50.000 sort of this benign
02:23:51.359 warmth where growing seasons are
02:23:55.120 months longer than now you know farming
02:23:58.160 you know 14 1500 feet higher in the
02:24:00.800 mountains than is now
02:24:01.920 possible um you know uh
02:24:05.439 you know long longer growing seasons and
02:24:07.600 rapid expansion of population during
02:24:09.520 this this era
02:24:10.560 this would have been the era you know
02:24:12.720 think think about what was the biblical
02:24:14.240 injunction that yahweh gave to adam and
02:24:16.479 eve what did he say
02:24:17.439 be fruitful and multiply replenish the
02:24:21.439 earth
02:24:21.920 and subdue it be fruitful and multiply
02:24:24.720 well if
02:24:25.280 you've got a species hovering on the
02:24:27.120 brink of extinction what's the most
02:24:28.720 important thing that that species can do
02:24:31.280 lots of sex lots of reproduction right
02:24:35.600 in the context of those times it would
02:24:38.720 have been very important for people to
02:24:40.560 have
02:24:41.200 lots of sex to quickly re-establish the
02:24:43.520 viability of the human species because
02:24:45.680 we were literally
02:24:47.120 it now appears hovering on the brink of
02:24:49.359 extinction as were
02:24:50.960 so many of the other large mammals of
02:24:52.880 the planet right
02:24:54.479 and nature gave us this interval this
02:24:57.200 window of three or four thousand years
02:24:59.040 of extremely
02:25:00.399 mild climate right during this time
02:25:04.399 human population rapidly expanded and
02:25:06.560 moved into these vacated habitats
02:25:09.520 around six thousand years ago the
02:25:11.840 climate shifted
02:25:13.600 what started was has been called by the
02:25:16.200 paleoclimatologist the neo-glaciation
02:25:19.760 because the planet cooled a couple of
02:25:22.080 degrees
02:25:23.200 what happened agricultural habitats
02:25:26.640 contracted the the growing the the
02:25:29.680 the elevation of viable agriculture came
02:25:32.160 down
02:25:33.120 okay now if you've got settled human
02:25:35.040 communities that have become well
02:25:36.840 established
02:25:38.000 and living in the context of that
02:25:41.600 environment
02:25:42.560 and now suddenly that environment
02:25:44.160 changes right
02:25:46.080 exactly coincident with those
02:25:47.840 environmental changes around 6000 years
02:25:50.240 ago is when we see
02:25:51.760 the first appearance of human conflict
02:25:54.160 because now with this change in climate
02:25:55.920 you've got this disruption this major
02:25:57.680 disruption in human communities that
02:25:59.359 have been
02:26:00.000 well established and proliferating for
02:26:01.680 three or four thousand years
02:26:03.920 think about you know if you're you know
02:26:05.520 living in a in a community and you're
02:26:07.280 farming at 10 000 feet above sea level
02:26:09.840 a smaller example a micro example would
02:26:12.319 be the freezing out of the of the
02:26:14.319 greenland colonists
02:26:15.840 with the onset of the little ice age
02:26:18.319 right
02:26:18.880 for 500 years they were able to farm on
02:26:21.680 the west coast of greenland
02:26:23.200 and then the little ice age came on and
02:26:25.359 they were frozen out
02:26:26.800 and they tried to hang on as long as
02:26:29.040 they could but it kept getting harder
02:26:30.960 and harder to grow crops
02:26:33.600 and then the climate declined further
02:26:35.680 and the sea ice began to move
02:26:37.120 south and the one they who waited too
02:26:39.840 long
02:26:40.240 lost their opportunity because once the
02:26:41.920 sea ice had moved south it cut off the
02:26:43.760 sea lanes
02:26:44.640 so that they could actually evacuate the
02:26:47.359 greenland colonies completely went
02:26:48.960 extinct
02:26:49.760 iceland itself was almost completely
02:26:51.600 depopulated during this
02:26:53.760 if we take that scenario expand it and
02:26:56.720 go back 6000 years ago
02:26:58.240 we essentially see a very similar
02:27:00.160 parallel phenomena going on
02:27:02.160 and so when you figure for during that a
02:27:05.040 civilization
02:27:05.920 age of the goddess this this time that
02:27:07.760 people were worshiping the earth in the
02:27:09.359 form of this corpulent
02:27:10.800 pregnant goddess this benign motherly
02:27:13.760 nurturing goddess
02:27:15.200 there was no reason for conflict because
02:27:17.359 human populations were small they were
02:27:19.359 isolated
02:27:20.240 resource base was enormous and then
02:27:23.680 with the climate change what happened
02:27:26.319 suddenly now
02:27:27.280 human communities and populations are
02:27:29.200 disrupted
02:27:30.399 migrations began happening one group
02:27:33.200 conflicts with another group
02:27:34.720 and now we see the implements and the
02:27:37.359 evidence of warfare
02:27:39.439 if we go back to ten thousand twelve
02:27:41.600 thousand years ago
02:27:42.880 clearly whatever happened then must have
02:27:45.760 been profoundly traumatic to the
02:27:47.520 survivors
02:27:48.800 think about this if you were the
02:27:50.160 survivor of an event
02:27:52.319 that basically erased modern
02:27:53.920 civilization and you were living in a
02:27:56.160 small
02:27:56.640 isolated band of survivors with no way
02:27:59.439 to communicate with the rest of the
02:28:01.040 world
02:28:01.680 and no knowledge of whether there was
02:28:03.359 even other survivors anywhere on the
02:28:05.280 earth
02:28:06.640 it could profoundly affect you your your
02:28:08.800 consciousness
02:28:10.000 and and that could be so profound that
02:28:12.960 it's
02:28:13.520 the imprint of those events could be so
02:28:15.280 profound that it could be
02:28:16.640 passed on you know for generations
02:28:20.319 and and be lodged in our subconscious
02:28:22.399 this idea of human conflict necessary
02:28:25.040 for human survival and the traumas that
02:28:27.040 have been visited upon our species by
02:28:29.120 nature itself
02:28:31.920 so i think that once we come to terms
02:28:34.720 with the
02:28:35.439 possibly origins of huma only until we
02:28:38.000 come to terms with the origin of human
02:28:39.680 conflict
02:28:40.720 are we going to be able to purge it once
02:28:43.040 and for all
02:28:44.080 and and realize that that the modern
02:28:47.760 analog for that scenario was that
02:28:51.600 coming out of that catastrophe abundant
02:28:54.240 resources
02:28:55.359 abundance habitat abundant space
02:28:58.640 no conflict for territory resources
02:29:00.640 because the human population was
02:29:02.319 limited what i suggest is that if people
02:29:05.520 want to understand
02:29:06.720 the viable future of the human species
02:29:09.040 go out on a
02:29:10.479 crystal clear night and look at the sky
02:29:14.640 there is the future there's our
02:29:16.160 potential future because
02:29:17.840 the scenarios that have been around
02:29:19.280 since the 1970s show
02:29:21.280 that everything that we're extracting
02:29:23.520 now from the earth
02:29:24.880 the minerals the precious metals the
02:29:27.359 hydrocarbons
02:29:28.720 it's all out there in infinite abundance
02:29:31.359 and it's basically
02:29:32.560 just outside of our doorstep and we are
02:29:35.520 as close
02:29:36.160 now to being able to harvest the
02:29:38.560 resources of the cosmic environment
02:29:40.960 as we were from setting foot on the moon
02:29:43.359 in 1960.
02:29:44.800 do you think we've been visited before
02:29:46.800 by something from other planets
02:29:49.680 i think perhaps long long ago maybe but
02:29:53.120 there's another scenario there that
02:29:55.040 has been overlooked in all of the
02:29:56.640 discussions about ufos and aliens and at
02:29:59.040 some point we'll talk about that
02:30:01.200 at some point yeah you tease
02:30:07.920 well you know it's the kind of thing
02:30:10.319 where you kind of need to
02:30:11.520 lay out the case and and what i like to
02:30:14.240 do
02:30:14.800 is basically present the evidence and
02:30:17.439 see if
02:30:18.720 whoever then draws the same conclusions
02:30:21.439 from that evidence that i have
02:30:23.200 so okay let me let me put it to you this
02:30:25.520 way
02:30:26.800 in what we were talking about at the
02:30:28.080 very beginning of this interview
02:30:30.319 and and talking about 7 000 generations
02:30:32.720 of people
02:30:33.359 and and the fact that in in four or five
02:30:36.080 generations we went from horseback to
02:30:38.000 rocket ships
02:30:40.640 how many times in the last 7 000 years
02:30:42.800 do you suppose
02:30:43.840 that we could have done that to me it's
02:30:46.479 not impossible that we could have
02:30:47.840 achieved
02:30:48.319 flight even inter in interplanetary
02:30:51.760 flight
02:30:52.720 more than once just as we have now just
02:30:55.200 think about it
02:30:56.080 we have we have achieved interplanetary
02:30:58.000 flight even though only manned
02:30:59.840 expeditions to to nearer space but we're
02:31:02.240 sending our
02:31:03.200 satellites out beyond the solar system
02:31:05.680 all of this has come about in my
02:31:07.040 lifetime
02:31:07.840 right totally in my lifetime all of it
02:31:09.680 since the 1950s my grandfather
02:31:12.000 when he was a kid you know it was horses
02:31:14.800 and a big point
02:31:15.760 is that if we died off now for some sort
02:31:18.319 of mass extinction event there'd be very
02:31:20.080 little evidence of this
02:31:21.439 space travel thousands there'd be no
02:31:23.280 evidence yet all the aluminum all the
02:31:25.200 the stuff that the rockets you got out
02:31:26.720 of it would all be gone
02:31:27.760 right the earth would absorb it now
02:31:29.760 let's just consider
02:31:31.600 as a wild outrageous working hypothesis
02:31:35.439 that humans have been able to offload
02:31:38.240 from the planet
02:31:39.600 prior to it prior to the modern space
02:31:42.399 age
02:31:43.439 so one point in time we went to mars
02:31:46.000 there's probably somewhere a little
02:31:47.120 closer than that it would have made
02:31:48.399 sense
02:31:49.520 like the moon like the moon like we've
02:31:51.920 been able to establish a base on the
02:31:53.600 moon
02:31:54.399 yeah now this isn't like i said i'm just
02:31:57.920 crazy right up front this is an
02:31:59.359 outrageous mason crazy you're a heretic
02:32:02.399 what else you've done drugs dismiss this
02:32:05.439 man
02:32:06.000 this this is over it's time to lock me
02:32:09.840 away
02:32:11.680 gag me muzzle me and laugh we consider
02:32:14.160 the fact that our civilization
02:32:16.080 you know if all your theories are true
02:32:18.080 which they most certainly appear to be
02:32:20.080 our civilization has been rebooted as of
02:32:22.479 12 000 years ago
02:32:24.160 modern civilization emerges somewhere
02:32:26.160 around 7 000 years ago
02:32:28.240 in 4.6 billion years of life on earth or
02:32:31.840 excuse me of the life of the earth the
02:32:33.439 earth existing and then life on earth
02:32:35.600 being
02:32:36.080 you know in our form what few hundred
02:32:39.680 thousand years
02:32:40.960 right in a hundred thousand years is a
02:32:43.399 long time that's
02:32:45.120 ten ten events since the big
02:32:48.560 impact ten times well remember the
02:32:51.359 greenland ice core graph that i showed
02:32:52.880 you i mean
02:32:53.439 what you're seeing there is a dozen or
02:32:56.160 more
02:32:56.640 enormous events in the last quarter
02:32:58.960 million years
02:32:59.920 in the time probably the huma again the
02:33:02.560 oldest human skeleton
02:33:03.840 modern modern human skeleton is now
02:33:05.520 dated to about 180 000 years
02:33:07.680 how much earlier than that were we i
02:33:10.000 don't know but
02:33:11.280 conservatively we can say 180 000 years
02:33:13.359 that greenland ice core graph that i
02:33:14.720 showed you goes back 250
02:33:17.040 000. so the rigveda stories of the
02:33:19.280 vamanas and the flying
02:33:21.200 crafts and all that could actually have
02:33:23.040 been based on real
02:33:24.880 live objects real live spaceships
02:33:28.640 read the sumerian stories what did they
02:33:30.800 say in the wake of the flood it was so
02:33:32.880 disastrous that what did the gods do
02:33:35.280 they fled the earth and went to space it
02:33:37.280 says right there in the myth itself
02:33:40.000 says they left they went went they left
02:33:42.160 the earth and went to the heavens
02:33:43.600 because what was going on on the earth
02:33:45.439 was so traumatic it even freaked them
02:33:47.200 out
02:33:48.399 read the story the gods the gods anki
02:33:51.359 and eon
02:33:52.240 and nina ninerta and the rest of them
02:33:54.960 what did you think of zechariah sitchin
02:33:56.880 and his
02:33:58.200 fantastical translations of the sumerian
02:34:01.520 texts
02:34:02.000 i'm dubious about some of history most
02:34:04.640 are right yeah
02:34:05.520 most people who are experts in the
02:34:07.200 sumerian languages in cuny forum
02:34:09.520 yeah think that he was kind of cuckoo
02:34:11.439 kind of cuckoo yeah well but
02:34:13.120 what's fascinating is there's so much
02:34:15.040 that they absolutely
02:34:17.200 understood that's really confusing like
02:34:19.520 they understood
02:34:20.640 they had an accurate depiction of our
02:34:23.200 solar system which included
02:34:24.800 pluto which included all the planets
02:34:28.319 in all the orbit in in in the correct
02:34:31.760 you know relatively correct sizes on
02:34:34.880 these clay tablets
02:34:36.479 that they made nine thousand seven
02:34:39.120 thousand who knows how many thousand
02:34:40.640 years ago
02:34:41.680 you know yeah i i guess i'm you know i
02:34:44.080 read some sitchin stuff
02:34:45.840 years and years ago and at the time took
02:34:48.800 it with a grain of salt
02:34:50.160 and subsequent to that you know after
02:34:51.840 i've seen some of the the critiques of
02:34:53.439 him
02:34:54.160 you know i'm kind of in that category
02:34:56.800 myself of thinking his is
02:34:58.319 you know his some of his translations
02:34:59.920 are are dubious he made some leaps
02:35:02.640 for sure but what they did discover what
02:35:05.280 they have this
02:35:06.000 just it's so fascinating to me when you
02:35:08.160 look at like the caduceus
02:35:09.920 which will very clearly resembles the
02:35:12.160 double helix of dna
02:35:14.000 and how it's closely associated with
02:35:15.920 some of these images of
02:35:17.280 larger beings holding little smaller
02:35:19.840 people
02:35:20.479 with tails like what the [ __ ] is that
02:35:23.520 like this idea of genetic engineering of
02:35:26.080 taking lower primates and introducing
02:35:29.120 human or alien dna into these lower
02:35:32.399 primates to create modern humans
02:35:35.520 i don't know what to think about that it
02:35:37.120 sounds ridiculous
02:35:39.280 but if we found a planet like let's say
02:35:42.000 we exist
02:35:43.040 in this state right now and uh we
02:35:46.160 uh we evolve without getting hit in the
02:35:48.720 head by a big rock from space
02:35:50.640 for another thousand years or another 10
02:35:53.359 000 years let's
02:35:54.000 get really [ __ ] crazy just imagine
02:35:56.319 how far we could come if we don't blow
02:35:57.920 ourselves up
02:35:58.880 we don't yellowstone doesn't explode we
02:36:01.439 live another
02:36:02.160 10 000 years and we jet off into the
02:36:05.600 cosmos and find some planet with a bunch
02:36:07.359 of dumb monkeys on it
02:36:08.640 you don't think we would splice our dna
02:36:10.479 into those dumb monkeys just to say
02:36:12.000 listen i think you guys could do better
02:36:14.880 you could be like us we're going to give
02:36:16.160 you a little bump we know what's coming
02:36:18.080 if you guys keep going along this way
02:36:20.160 you could get to where we are
02:36:22.080 in the million plus years we can get a
02:36:24.080 little injection maybe it's in how about
02:36:26.080 a scenario like this okay
02:36:28.319 well from our superior perspective we
02:36:30.240 know that you guys down there are living
02:36:32.000 on a vulnerable planet that's going to
02:36:33.680 be
02:36:34.240 have its ass kicked every so often right
02:36:36.720 so we're going to do something to
02:36:38.240 accelerate your evolution a bit
02:36:40.000 so that perhaps you can uh become a
02:36:42.160 little bit more intelligent and figure
02:36:43.840 this out
02:36:44.560 we're going to leave some clues behind
02:36:46.319 for you and
02:36:48.319 you know then we're going to leave it in
02:36:49.600 your hands to basically redeem to redeem
02:36:52.880 the planet
02:36:54.399 it's amazing how often people just like
02:36:56.000 will completely dismiss any ideas like
02:36:58.080 that but yet
02:36:59.920 we clearly are we're very advanced and
02:37:03.520 compared to life on earth
02:37:05.280 but clearly we're advancing
02:37:08.720 into the solar system at the very least
02:37:10.880 with robots
02:37:12.240 you know we haven't really been doing
02:37:14.800 manned space trips anymore but we're
02:37:16.960 sending a lot of [ __ ] robots
02:37:18.880 yeah we're sending satellites we're
02:37:21.040 sending all these things to
02:37:23.439 go around other planets and take images
02:37:26.160 we're
02:37:26.560 sending robots that land on mars to rove
02:37:29.359 around
02:37:30.080 and take photos and soil samples and
02:37:32.960 send
02:37:33.600 information back through the sky to
02:37:35.520 earth i mean that's pretty
02:37:37.520 it is fantastic stuff well imagine
02:37:40.800 if you tried to describe to this this to
02:37:42.800 somebody 100 years ago
02:37:44.240 they'd go get out of here yeah this is
02:37:46.000 outrageous i don't even want to hear
02:37:47.680 such
02:37:48.080 ridiculous times but like you just said
02:37:51.520 considering the pace of change over the
02:37:53.680 last century
02:37:54.960 you know given us a century ago there
02:37:56.240 was no airline industry right
02:37:58.399 of course the thing was if you know if
02:38:00.000 you had the you know
02:38:01.520 government bureaucracies like you like
02:38:03.680 you have now back then
02:38:04.960 orville and wilbur would have never been
02:38:06.479 able to test their flights because some
02:38:08.080 government bureaucrat
02:38:09.200 would have been out there saying you
02:38:10.240 don't have the proper permits to do this
02:38:12.160 right
02:38:12.640 and right now that's i you know one of
02:38:14.319 the big obstacles is that we've gotten
02:38:16.479 we've got these top heavy political
02:38:18.080 systems that are really i think
02:38:20.160 really encumbering the creative process
02:38:22.880 the evolutionary process that's why i'm
02:38:25.280 such a big supporter of of basically
02:38:28.160 freedom
02:38:28.880 you know getting back to the idea of
02:38:31.120 individual liberty
02:38:32.160 because i think the upside of people
02:38:34.399 being free
02:38:35.680 yeah of course there's a cost of freedom
02:38:37.120 and there's going to be a downside to it
02:38:38.960 but
02:38:39.520 the upside i think again is so much
02:38:41.840 greater than the downside that
02:38:43.920 that's what the internet is showing the
02:38:45.920 internet is it represents freedom the
02:38:48.319 free
02:38:49.040 the ability to freely distribute
02:38:50.960 information
02:38:52.080 this show itself would have never
02:38:53.840 existed this podcast
02:38:56.000 could not have existed without something
02:38:58.000 like the internet no one would have ever
02:38:59.359 given me a show
02:39:00.640 no one ever like said yeah go talk to
02:39:03.200 this guy from
02:39:04.080 georgia for three hours about asteroid
02:39:06.560 impacts people will like it
02:39:08.080 you know get out of here get the [ __ ]
02:39:10.160 out of here actually i'm from minnesota
02:39:11.760 well i mean you live there yeah you know
02:39:14.080 right but it's just
02:39:15.120 the whole idea is that freedom allows
02:39:18.319 people to innovate at a much quicker
02:39:19.680 pace yes
02:39:20.399 it allows negative things too but so
02:39:22.479 does life itself there's
02:39:23.840 there's more of a chance of negative
02:39:26.720 things
02:39:27.120 if things are controlled yeah if things
02:39:29.359 are
02:39:30.560 locked down and innovation goes where
02:39:33.760 does you know it goes right out i
02:39:35.200 mean in my own personal sphere like 20
02:39:37.359 years like i'm building a project right
02:39:39.280 now
02:39:39.680 in atlanta took me six months and nine
02:39:43.200 trips
02:39:44.000 down to city hall to get permission from
02:39:46.399 the bureaucrats to do a small project
02:39:48.479 which 20 years ago i could have gotten
02:39:50.720 that permission
02:39:51.600 in an hour or two 20 years before that i
02:39:54.319 didn't even
02:39:54.880 would have would not have even needed
02:39:56.479 permission from anybody
02:39:58.160 you know oh you've got your own house
02:39:59.920 you want to do this your neighbors don't
02:40:01.600 care
02:40:02.240 we'll do it see right so this is
02:40:05.520 what my experience there multiply that
02:40:08.240 by millions across the board you know
02:40:10.160 it's like
02:40:11.600 you know it's going to get to the point
02:40:12.880 where you know can we do we dare
02:40:15.040 breathe out without a permit because
02:40:16.640 we're exhaling carbon dioxide
02:40:19.439 you know right so um
02:40:22.560 yeah i just i think that a couple of
02:40:24.960 things need to happen one we need to
02:40:26.560 really
02:40:27.279 get back to the idea and america that's
02:40:30.240 the great dream and vision of america
02:40:32.160 was that this was supposed to be the
02:40:33.920 home of
02:40:34.560 freedom on planet earth yeah bureaucracy
02:40:37.040 is pretty disgusting but it's also i
02:40:38.880 feel like
02:40:39.760 sometimes we need some resistance in
02:40:42.560 order to facilitate action
02:40:44.560 some resistance yeah and some resistance
02:40:46.720 sometimes
02:40:47.680 gives us this real desire to overcome
02:40:51.040 that resistance which
02:40:52.319 makes innovation yeah you know and that
02:40:55.359 might be one of the things that we're
02:40:56.880 experiencing with this new culture
02:40:59.120 that's emerging from the internet
02:41:00.960 it's kind of emerging in response to the
02:41:03.439 resistance that we
02:41:04.800 received from i mean going back to
02:41:07.359 psychedelics from the 60s to the 70s
02:41:10.000 70s into the 80s and the 90s the
02:41:12.000 internet emerges
02:41:13.200 and the internet is causing this big
02:41:15.760 push back
02:41:16.720 on all the archaic ideas of being
02:41:18.880 promoted during those
02:41:20.399 dark decades yeah
02:41:23.680 and i totally agree with you i mean
02:41:25.040 without some resist i mean
02:41:26.800 after all i mean if there's no
02:41:28.080 resistance you know we're going to
02:41:29.439 basically turn into slugs
02:41:30.880 we turn into couch potatoes we turn the
02:41:32.479 couch delays right we're lazy
02:41:34.399 yeah it's very rare that human beings by
02:41:36.720 default
02:41:37.520 are ambitious it's like in response to
02:41:40.479 something like
02:41:41.520 one of the worst things you could do to
02:41:43.040 a kid is
02:41:44.560 give the kid everything they want and
02:41:46.640 not have them work
02:41:47.760 right they'd never develop any instincts
02:41:50.160 to work towards things they never
02:41:51.760 develop any
02:41:52.720 any instincts to to recognize that
02:41:55.920 there's a benefit to struggling and
02:41:58.000 being uncomfortable and that the rewards
02:42:00.479 when when you have a hard day's work and
02:42:03.760 a job completed that you feel satisfied
02:42:06.479 by
02:42:06.880 then the beer tastes so much better so
02:42:08.880 much better the jewish kabbalists have a
02:42:11.200 term for that which i can't remember but
02:42:12.880 it translates as the bread of shame
02:42:15.040 and it's like the bread of shame is the
02:42:16.640 bread you get that you didn't really
02:42:18.160 have to work for you didn't have to
02:42:19.520 struggle you didn't have to put forward
02:42:21.200 any effort it's just given to you you
02:42:23.439 know and
02:42:24.560 and you know it's like one of the the
02:42:27.680 the the stories that kind of goes along
02:42:30.080 with presenting that is
02:42:31.439 you know the the the the man who builds
02:42:34.080 up this great business empire you know
02:42:36.160 and then
02:42:36.800 um you know he's getting ready to retire
02:42:39.200 and he wants to pass it on to his son
02:42:40.960 and he says
02:42:41.840 you know come in i'm going to make you
02:42:43.359 ceo of my business empire and the whole
02:42:46.080 you're going to be able to run the whole
02:42:47.120 thing and the sun says no thanks i don't
02:42:48.640 want and he goes
02:42:49.279 what do you mean he says well let me
02:42:51.439 start at the bottom and work my way up
02:42:53.120 and earn
02:42:54.080 that position and it's going to mean a
02:42:55.840 whole lot more to me and i'm going to be
02:42:57.279 a hell of a lot more
02:42:58.399 effective in that position and if it's
02:43:00.160 just dumped in my lap
02:43:01.439 it's just so rare that anybody has that
02:43:03.200 mentality though most people would take
02:43:05.439 the easy road every single time
02:43:07.680 well and that is to the consternation i
02:43:10.160 think of our ancestors who didn't look
02:43:11.680 at it that way
02:43:12.880 you know the people that came across the
02:43:14.960 ocean you know at
02:43:16.399 great hardship didn't look at it that
02:43:18.000 way and i think that they would be
02:43:19.920 pretty much rolling in their graves if
02:43:21.439 they could see you know what's
02:43:23.359 basically oh well let's we'll just let
02:43:25.439 the government take care of us
02:43:26.880 right i don't have to get a job because
02:43:28.800 the government's going to take care of
02:43:30.080 us
02:43:30.319 but they would also look at our
02:43:31.600 computers and go holy [ __ ] you guys have
02:43:33.760 figured some things out
02:43:34.960 yeah wait a minute hold on you ask a
02:43:37.279 question to your phone and it gives you
02:43:38.800 the answer
02:43:39.520 yeah i mean they never even thought
02:43:41.279 about that on star trek
02:43:42.720 yeah and and see what that does is it
02:43:44.399 shows there's these parallel trends that
02:43:46.640 are that are happening you know so yeah
02:43:48.640 i'm i'm
02:43:49.279 you know i'm that's why i tend to be
02:43:51.279 more optimistic i'm not a pessimist i i
02:43:53.600 have great hopes for our future
02:43:55.279 i do too and people give me a hard time
02:43:57.120 for it sometimes you know they think i'm
02:43:58.560 unrealistic
02:43:59.439 or that that's the the hippie side of me
02:44:02.319 you know that i have a hippie ideology
02:44:04.080 as well um the sacred geometry
02:44:07.600 sacred geometry name like why did you
02:44:09.520 choose that as the name for your website
02:44:11.600 well because at the time i was looking
02:44:13.840 at there was so much interest
02:44:15.840 um and because i saw it as a a venue for
02:44:19.439 putting information out there about that
02:44:21.279 and showing some of the amazing
02:44:22.880 correlations and linkages
02:44:24.479 um you know between the subject of
02:44:27.120 geometry
02:44:28.000 and so many of these other things like i
02:44:29.680 said you know the mayan temples
02:44:31.680 egyptian structures and helping using
02:44:34.640 that
02:44:35.200 as a key to decipher or decode these
02:44:38.399 messages that have been
02:44:39.920 have been um embodied in architecture
02:44:43.760 it's the key it's the it's a master it's
02:44:45.760 one of the master keys to decoding
02:44:48.000 the archaic wisdom tradition there's no
02:44:50.319 question and geometry pervades
02:44:52.160 everything i mean geometry pervades
02:44:54.319 you know we can actually i can show you
02:44:56.479 now studies that have shown that the the
02:44:58.240 exact architecture of the solar system
02:45:00.560 if you changed it even a little bit
02:45:03.359 none of this could happen you know
02:45:04.800 because as it is now you have this
02:45:06.880 great reservoir of comets outside the
02:45:08.880 orbit of neptune called the kuiper disk
02:45:10.720 right
02:45:12.319 at the inside of that on the inner
02:45:14.560 perimeter of that disk of comets
02:45:16.800 uh comets are in a quasi-stable
02:45:19.279 condition
02:45:19.920 in other words it doesn't take much to
02:45:21.920 perturb them from that position
02:45:24.399 but at the same time there isn't much
02:45:26.160 there to perturb them so they generally
02:45:28.240 are just slowly orbiting the sun
02:45:31.120 well what happens is conjunctions of the
02:45:33.359 great outer planets
02:45:34.880 uranus and neptune primarily the
02:45:37.040 combined gravitational forces exerted on
02:45:39.520 the inner part of the kuiper disk are
02:45:41.120 enough to dislodge comets
02:45:43.279 and send them either either the gravity
02:45:46.160 effect think of this
02:45:47.439 if you've got a gravity effect pulling
02:45:49.200 on something from behind and it's moving
02:45:51.040 this way it's going to
02:45:51.920 act as a breaking mechanism if it's a
02:45:54.399 head
02:45:55.040 in drawing on it it's going to act as an
02:45:56.880 accelerating mechanism
02:45:58.479 so if you accelerate one of these
02:46:00.720 objects it moves out further from the
02:46:02.720 sun
02:46:03.279 if you decelerate it it moves in closer
02:46:06.000 to the sun
02:46:07.200 what happens is is that the conjunctions
02:46:09.760 of the outer planets
02:46:10.880 can move these comets inside the
02:46:14.080 the become within the sphere of
02:46:15.439 influence of the planets
02:46:17.279 and it just so happens in in
02:46:19.439 astrophysicists have worked out the
02:46:21.200 mathematics of it
02:46:22.560 that the masses and the spacing of the
02:46:25.040 four great outer planets jupiter saturn
02:46:27.279 uranus and neptune
02:46:28.560 are exactly what they need to be to
02:46:31.600 transport comets from the kuiper disk to
02:46:33.920 the inner solar system and if you change
02:46:35.840 that
02:46:36.560 even a little bit you would lose this
02:46:38.880 they've referred to it as the
02:46:40.240 the the uh the bucket mechanism or the
02:46:43.120 uh
02:46:43.840 uh like a bucket handoff each planet
02:46:46.880 will hand off
02:46:47.760 the comet to the next one and then when
02:46:49.520 it gets to jupiter the big one like you
02:46:51.439 said earlier jupiter is either going to
02:46:53.600 accelerate it and throw it back out
02:46:55.520 or it's going to decelerate it and send
02:46:57.279 it in towards the sun where it becomes
02:46:58.800 an earth crosser
02:46:59.840 where it begins to disaggregate and in
02:47:02.560 the process
02:47:04.640 fertilize the earth with its
02:47:06.880 constituents
02:47:08.080 which we now know are all kinds of
02:47:11.040 interesting and exotic materials
02:47:13.680 so if it turns out and it almost
02:47:15.920 certainly will and
02:47:16.720 in terms of the the panspermia idea that
02:47:19.279 that life was
02:47:20.240 originated on earth by comets that you
02:47:23.279 had to have an environment that was
02:47:24.800 conducive
02:47:25.600 you had to have this matrix of
02:47:27.040 environmental conditions that if were
02:47:28.880 altered slightly
02:47:30.399 would not allow the proliferation of
02:47:32.000 higher life you now have the
02:47:33.840 introduction of cometary material into
02:47:35.920 that
02:47:36.240 well if the architecture of the outer
02:47:37.840 solar system was not exactly lined up in
02:47:40.080 the geometry that it is
02:47:42.479 then you would never have that delivery
02:47:44.560 of the organics and the volatiles from
02:47:46.560 the comet
02:47:47.439 it's fact it's likely that the oceans
02:47:49.760 that the hydrosphere originated from
02:47:52.240 space
02:47:52.880 without the oceans where would life on
02:47:54.880 earth be you see
02:47:56.479 now here's where it gets interesting the
02:47:58.960 architecture of the solar system is
02:48:00.800 what's condensed
02:48:02.000 and embodied within the sacred
02:48:04.080 architecture of old
02:48:06.399 so they've taken that those proportions
02:48:08.319 however that got there
02:48:10.080 whether they knew it directly or on some
02:48:12.640 subconscious level
02:48:14.000 and incorporated that into the designs
02:48:16.319 and the proportions of the ancient
02:48:17.840 sacred structures
02:48:19.040 it's there basically the model of the
02:48:22.000 holy city the new jerusalem is described
02:48:24.319 in the
02:48:24.800 book of revelations is basically a model
02:48:28.160 of the solar system architecture
02:48:30.720 so it abides by bowed's law is that what
02:48:34.000 it is
02:48:34.960 yes i think it's bidet i think that's
02:48:37.040 how you say it
02:48:38.080 b-o-d-e-s is that what it was just
02:48:39.760 b-o-d-e b-o-d-e
02:48:41.680 oh it's boday yeah and i've only seen it
02:48:43.680 written um and it
02:48:45.439 that that law being that the size and
02:48:48.880 mass of a planet
02:48:50.560 allows you to extrapolate and find out
02:48:53.520 how
02:48:54.000 big and far away the next planet would
02:48:56.000 be
02:48:57.359 and so yeah it shows up that one of the
02:48:59.920 intervals within that sequence is
02:49:01.680 for example where the asteroid belt is
02:49:03.600 there's there's no planet there but
02:49:05.120 there's an asteroid
02:49:06.080 right and that sort of coincides with
02:49:08.080 the ancient sumerian myth of the
02:49:10.000 creation of earth being an
02:49:11.600 impact that there was a and also earth 1
02:49:14.960 and earth 2.
02:49:15.840 they've they know that earth was at one
02:49:18.000 point in time
02:49:19.279 different and it was impacted and that's
02:49:21.200 also what created the moon
02:49:22.720 right yes well that's that's the theory
02:49:25.359 about the moon but
02:49:27.040 got the moon i mean the moon is really
02:49:29.120 something we could talk about for the
02:49:30.479 next hour
02:49:31.200 and you know in it we can save that for
02:49:33.680 for a future
02:49:34.560 uh broadcast but the moon is really one
02:49:37.279 of the grand
02:49:38.319 symbols of the great mysteries with a
02:49:40.240 capital m no question um
02:49:42.319 and it's right there every night i mean
02:49:43.760 right now i think we're like one day
02:49:45.040 away from the full moon right now as
02:49:46.560 we're sitting here and
02:49:48.000 i would highly recommend that anybody
02:49:49.760 listening to this go out and begin
02:49:52.000 uh contemplating the moon unless you're
02:49:54.000 afraid of werewolves unless you're
02:49:55.279 afraid of werewolves
02:49:57.600 unless you're afraid of becoming
02:49:59.200 transformed into a werewolf
02:50:01.520 um yeah so the the how is jerusalem
02:50:05.439 designed in representation
02:50:08.479 as a representation of the solar system
02:50:10.960 uh well
02:50:12.160 the the uh the hypothetical jerusalem
02:50:14.720 the new jerusalem
02:50:16.319 well you know it describes this layout
02:50:19.359 um it gets complex um
02:50:22.960 and again when i show this to people i
02:50:25.279 usually rely on a lot of graphs and
02:50:27.200 images
02:50:28.000 and and reproductions uh geometric
02:50:30.479 diagrams and so on
02:50:32.080 but basically it's describing the city
02:50:33.680 lieth four square the length the height
02:50:35.359 and the breadth of it are equal twelve
02:50:36.720 thousand furlongs and there's a wall
02:50:38.240 great and high 144 cubits
02:50:40.399 according to the measure of a man that
02:50:41.920 is of the angel
02:50:43.439 and then it goes on to describe other
02:50:45.040 things but it's when you begin to
02:50:47.279 begin to do the analysis of these
02:50:49.040 numbers you discover
02:50:50.720 it it opens up this whole world of of
02:50:53.520 numerical symbolism
02:50:55.840 the twelve thousand furlongs you know
02:50:58.080 how much a furlong is
02:51:00.160 no furlong is one-eighth of a mile it
02:51:02.160 still exists it's a very ancient unit of
02:51:04.160 measurement still exists it's used in
02:51:05.840 horse racing that's the one place that i
02:51:07.600 know of it still exists
02:51:09.359 1 8 of a mile that's 660 feet right
02:51:12.640 now if you were to take the earth right
02:51:15.359 the earth you know is an oblate spheroid
02:51:17.359 it spins on its axis so it bulges
02:51:19.279 towards the equator
02:51:20.640 shrinks towards the polar axis so the
02:51:22.640 difference is about 7
02:51:24.080 900 miles at the polar axis about 7
02:51:27.240 926 miles at the equatorial axis
02:51:30.399 but if you were to take a perfect sphere
02:51:32.800 with the same
02:51:33.680 area surface area as the earth actually
02:51:35.840 has that sphere would be 7
02:51:38.319 920 miles in diameter now that number
02:51:42.359 729
02:51:44.040 7920 is a very interesting number
02:51:46.880 because for one thing if we look at a
02:51:49.439 furlong
02:51:50.319 a furlong is 660 feet so
02:51:53.520 i'm putting 660. once you take that
02:51:55.680 calculator okay
02:51:56.880 okay now that's a furlong 660 feet
02:52:01.439 convert that to inches by going times 12
02:52:04.399 times 12
02:52:05.279 times 12. one two okay and equals
02:52:08.800 equals seven nine
02:52:11.920 two zero there it is diameter of the
02:52:14.560 earth in miles
02:52:15.760 that i just said right right the the
02:52:18.479 perfect sphere
02:52:20.399 that would have the same surface area
02:52:22.080 and the same volume as the earth is 7920
02:52:25.279 miles that's
02:52:25.920 and that's actually the the diameter of
02:52:27.520 the earth if you took
02:52:28.960 a line from the tropic of cancer 23.5
02:52:32.000 degrees north
02:52:32.960 through the earth to the tropic of
02:52:34.479 capricorn you would discover that that
02:52:36.720 diameter is about 7
02:52:38.240 920 miles that's the number which i'm
02:52:42.080 theorizing and i'm thinking with a lot
02:52:44.319 of
02:52:45.359 evidence to back up that ancient peoples
02:52:47.680 used to symbolize the earth
02:52:49.800 7920 but what you've just seen here
02:52:52.720 is that this ancient unit of measurement
02:52:54.399 called the furlong which is 660 feet
02:52:57.840 is to the inch exactly as the earth
02:53:00.960 is to the mile now what was the origin
02:53:03.920 of the mile
02:53:05.040 what where did this mile we we brought
02:53:07.439 it up earlier
02:53:08.880 length of the mile 5280 feet
02:53:11.920 right what's the or think about the
02:53:14.319 latin word mill what does that mean
02:53:16.720 a thousand right like a million is a
02:53:19.600 thousand thousands
02:53:21.279 uh a a millimeter is one thousandth of a
02:53:24.399 meter
02:53:24.960 right because they're prefixing mil the
02:53:28.000 mill the latin
02:53:29.359 prefix that means a thousand right so in
02:53:32.479 the that's where the
02:53:33.600 actual word mile comes from so a mile
02:53:37.120 is a thousand what it's a thousand paces
02:53:40.880 human paces so if you were to go out and
02:53:44.640 walk off a thousand paces say counting
02:53:47.600 every time your right foot hit the
02:53:48.880 ground
02:53:50.399 and you did that a thousand times you're
02:53:52.240 gonna have a mile more or less depending
02:53:54.399 on
02:53:54.720 your size you know i'm six foot one so
02:53:56.960 i'm gonna have a slightly longer pace
02:53:58.880 than somebody who's five foot five right
02:54:02.080 but that's where the origin of the mile
02:54:03.920 comes from from five thousand uh
02:54:06.080 from a thousand paces and given that the
02:54:08.800 the
02:54:09.359 that's standardized but it's very
02:54:10.720 ancient see now
02:54:13.600 the outer circle of stonehenge the
02:54:15.680 sarson stone circle
02:54:17.359 if you were to encompass it in a circle
02:54:19.840 that just
02:54:20.720 tangent to the outer faces of the stone
02:54:23.520 the radius of that circle
02:54:25.520 is 50 has been has been measured and
02:54:27.840 it's almost exactly 52.8
02:54:30.640 feet right or one hundredth of a mile
02:54:35.920 now if you take the diameter of
02:54:37.840 stonehenge it's double that
02:54:39.359 which is 105.6 feet
02:54:42.560 right 50 times 100 point
02:54:45.960 105.6 there's your mile it suggests that
02:54:49.279 the mile was being used
02:54:51.279 by those who built stonehenge 5000 years
02:54:55.200 ago
02:54:56.080 but you see this number 5.28 is a
02:54:59.200 universal
02:55:00.840 relationship it it for one thing it says
02:55:04.560 the average human pace related to the
02:55:07.600 foot
02:55:08.240 which again remember protagoras said man
02:55:11.120 is the measure of all things
02:55:12.800 right where comes the inch it's this
02:55:15.920 here's the inch right here the origin of
02:55:17.680 the inch the distance between your thumb
02:55:20.319 yeah or it's or the width of your thumb
02:55:22.240 it's this well yeah so you can you can
02:55:24.000 measure here and that's going to be
02:55:25.680 an inch or you can take this and that's
02:55:28.720 an inch as well
02:55:30.080 so okay so it's the tip of your thumb to
02:55:32.800 the
02:55:33.120 the first joint yes that's essentially
02:55:35.600 nice and it depends because obviously
02:55:37.439 humans vary in size right right but the
02:55:40.319 idea here is that
02:55:41.840 the units of ancient measurement derive
02:55:44.160 from one of two sources
02:55:46.000 from the human yardstick or the earth
02:55:49.120 itself
02:55:49.920 okay so now if you take the average
02:55:53.040 human pace
02:55:54.319 divide it by the average human foot it's
02:55:56.960 5.28
02:55:58.640 multiply that by a thousand and you have
02:56:00.319 the mile of 5280 feet
02:56:02.960 right i'm suggesting that that
02:56:06.080 unit of measurement was actually
02:56:07.760 incorporated into the design
02:56:09.439 of stonehenge right now what we have
02:56:12.720 just seen
02:56:13.520 is that the description of the new
02:56:15.359 jerusalem in the book of revelations
02:56:17.920 describes it as being 12
02:56:19.439 000 furlongs which again is an ancient
02:56:22.479 british unit of measurement
02:56:24.240 but probably used way beyond britain
02:56:27.279 and when we look at the ratio of the
02:56:29.200 furlong if we took
02:56:31.120 out in the parking lot here and laid out
02:56:33.279 a furlong 660 feet
02:56:35.680 and then marked off one inch on it that
02:56:38.160 furlong
02:56:38.800 to that inch would be exactly the same
02:56:41.040 as the diameter of the earth
02:56:42.640 to the mile now in
02:56:45.920 in the book of revelations what it says
02:56:48.000 is that the new jerusalem
02:56:49.680 is twelve thousand of these furlongs so
02:56:52.640 if you take
02:56:53.479 660 which i put in there
02:56:56.640 times 12 000
02:57:00.240 look at the number that comes up again
02:57:03.439 there's that number again 792.00
02:57:07.359 but it's been raised by orders of
02:57:08.640 magnitude yeah divide that
02:57:11.359 by the number of feet in a mile put the
02:57:13.760 divide button
02:57:14.880 okay divide by 5280
02:57:18.560 divide by 5280
02:57:22.000 there is what they're describing a body
02:57:25.200 that's 1500 miles in diameter
02:57:28.319 right so what is that what is 1500 miles
02:57:31.520 in diameter
02:57:32.319 that's the mystery now if you take
02:57:35.359 that number and i'm going to go to the
02:57:38.240 earth itself 7920
02:57:40.479 and divide it by the new jerusalem
02:57:43.359 divide by
02:57:45.160 1500 there's the ratio we get
02:57:50.319 the human pace to the human foot whoa
02:57:54.160 coincidence or are we beginning to see
02:57:56.560 that there's an
02:57:57.279 underlying pattern now five two eight
02:58:00.560 yeah five to eight so the ratio is there
02:58:03.439 right i'm not making any of this up
02:58:05.359 so you either dismiss it as coincidence
02:58:08.000 or you go okay there's an underlying
02:58:09.680 pattern here
02:58:11.120 and it's got some meaning to it now i
02:58:13.840 think
02:58:14.240 it's going to be beyond our ability
02:58:17.040 today to really get into that but
02:58:19.040 this is the kind of thing when you begin
02:58:20.319 to peel back these layers you begin to
02:58:22.000 discover
02:58:22.560 that there are these ratios built into
02:58:24.240 this so it's some
02:58:25.680 in in a sense fractal it's fractal yes
02:58:29.279 wow and and the idea here just like
02:58:31.439 protagoras said
02:58:32.880 that that we humans we're the measure of
02:58:36.160 of all things and and all of these
02:58:38.399 cosmic dimensions
02:58:40.080 are miniaturized and encoded in our very
02:58:42.800 anatomy
02:58:44.000 randall carlson we have run out of time
02:58:46.399 but you have blown minds on multiple
02:58:48.240 fronts
02:58:48.960 once again man we got to do another one
02:58:53.040 when's the next time you tell me uh
02:58:56.319 uh money's good well give me a few
02:58:57.840 months to recover from this one
02:59:01.439 okay you tell me i'm going to bed for a
02:59:03.680 week now
02:59:05.600 yeah i'm sure it's quite a burst of
02:59:07.520 information but thank you sir really
02:59:09.600 really appreciate it it's always a
02:59:10.880 pleasure having you here
02:59:12.000 you're one of my favorite podcast guests
02:59:13.439 without a doubt i enjoy it so much
02:59:15.600 and i'm going to go over this podcast
02:59:17.120 with a fine tooth comb and try to figure
02:59:18.800 it out i want to say one more quick
02:59:20.240 thing
02:59:20.720 a lot of this information that i've been
02:59:22.399 talking about here is on
02:59:24.000 our dvd that you can get uh online
02:59:28.399 cosmic patterns and cycles of
02:59:29.920 catastrophe where you get all of the
02:59:31.920 images and a lot of the background and
02:59:33.680 the stuff that we went into so if you go
02:59:35.279 to the sacred geometry international
02:59:36.880 website
02:59:37.760 you'll be able to find a link and find
02:59:39.359 out all about it what is the exact
02:59:40.960 website
02:59:41.520 sacred geometry geometry international
02:59:44.640 dot com i guess so if you just put
02:59:46.160 sacred geometry international in the
02:59:47.760 search engine it'll be the first thing
02:59:49.040 that comes up
02:59:49.760 and google and your twitter handle is
02:59:52.720 sacred geometry int correct
02:59:56.319 yeah right yeah is it right hold on a
02:59:58.319 second i'll check it on the profile real
