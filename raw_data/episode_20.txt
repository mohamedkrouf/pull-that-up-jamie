00:00:00.799 hello ben hey how's it going dude we're
00:00:02.639 here
00:00:03.360 we did it we did we're both alive first
00:00:05.440 of all congratulations on your thinness
00:00:07.839 thanks slender and healthy you look good
00:00:09.920 oh thank you i appreciate it turns out
00:00:11.519 running away from my children for
00:00:12.880 four months straight will do that to you
00:00:14.639 i literally took up running just to get
00:00:15.839 away from my
00:00:16.800 children just going outside just for
00:00:18.480 some mine space
00:00:19.920 it's la man you can't get outside unless
00:00:21.600 you're actively exercising are they
00:00:23.039 coming to arrest you
00:00:23.760 oh i could alluded to [ __ ] foot locker
00:00:25.599 right then they would have that would be
00:00:26.720 okay do you run with a mask on
00:00:28.320 no does anybody yell at you no no no
00:00:30.800 what do you
00:00:31.359 go to a track like what do you do no i
00:00:32.800 literally just run around on the streets
00:00:34.559 hoping that one day i will be hunted
00:00:37.120 down by the rioters
00:00:39.040 so i don't have to go deal with my
00:00:41.520 children screaming at me but yeah that's
00:00:43.040 that's the that's the goal
00:00:44.239 did you try to get healthier when covid
00:00:46.399 hit like were you worried and
00:00:48.480 a little bit it really wasn't about
00:00:49.600 covered it was just i was eating out too
00:00:50.879 much and
00:00:51.520 when i was relegated to home it was like
00:00:52.960 i had to learn how to use the barbecue
00:00:54.640 which i never learned how to use a
00:00:56.719 barbecue actually
00:00:58.079 and then it turned out it was actually
00:00:59.120 not that hard so i don't know what i was
00:01:00.800 doing for
00:01:01.520 years i got to give you some elk meat
00:01:03.520 are you barbecuing right now
00:01:04.959 oh yeah you're still doing it yeah i'll
00:01:06.320 give you some elk sausages
00:01:08.159 you have to do kosher right so i have to
00:01:09.520 oh that's not cool at all we'll have to
00:01:11.040 go get the elk and i'll have to actually
00:01:12.240 like kill it myself
00:01:13.360 is that what you have to do you'd have
00:01:14.640 to get the elk and then you'd have to
00:01:16.000 slice its throat or something like that
00:01:17.520 oh yeah it's good times
00:01:18.640 what how that what's the logic behind
00:01:20.720 that so i mean
00:01:22.159 not too fast into the biblical stuff but
00:01:24.720 the the original logic was that you were
00:01:26.640 supposed to
00:01:27.439 kill the animal in the most humane way
00:01:29.040 was the idea now do i know if it's the
00:01:30.640 most humane way now i have no idea it's
00:01:32.640 most certainly not okay
00:01:35.759 because you have to slice it up with the
00:01:37.040 rabbis man i don't know yeah
00:01:39.040 i get it how back in the day a very
00:01:41.200 sharp knife
00:01:42.960 going through the throat would have been
00:01:44.720 the most humane way because it's almost
00:01:46.320 painless
00:01:47.119 and then the blood just sort of pours
00:01:48.960 out and that's a wrap right
00:01:50.399 you don't want the blood anyway because
00:01:51.439 you're not allowed to eat blood and
00:01:52.320 judaism so oh really yeah yeah
00:01:54.880 so what do you do when you have a medium
00:01:56.000 rare steak i mean you salt the steak
00:01:58.240 really heavily
00:01:58.960 that's why this is why kosher meat is
00:02:00.399 pretty salty so if you go to a steak
00:02:02.320 house are you allowed to go to a steak
00:02:03.520 house
00:02:03.920 uh kosher steakhouse there are kosher
00:02:05.360 steakhouses ah you're so deep in that
00:02:06.880 one no man but you're a logical
00:02:08.959 intelligent guy does part does it every
00:02:10.959 now and then i like juxtapose those
00:02:13.040 but does every now and then it [ __ ] with
00:02:14.879 your head you're like what is this
00:02:16.480 i mean of course
00:02:19.760 i don't know there's a religious person
00:02:20.959 alive i mean who doesn't eventually go
00:02:22.640 like
00:02:22.959 okay it's a little weird but all right
00:02:25.280 you got to embrace the system
00:02:26.640 but you feel like for tradition and for
00:02:29.599 just the whole
00:02:30.800 jewish culture it's worth doing exactly
00:02:32.879 i mean you
00:02:33.920 you live the lifestyle and i feel like
00:02:35.519 it ain't that big a sacrifice to eat at
00:02:37.440 particular restaurants the restaurants
00:02:38.879 are still good
00:02:39.440 they've still got good kosher
00:02:40.239 restaurants one thing that we're seeing
00:02:42.319 with society
00:02:43.519 and culture in general and one thing
00:02:45.040 that sort of does support the idea of
00:02:47.200 maintaining these sort of rigid
00:02:48.879 disciplines is that
00:02:50.959 when things start to slide just a little
00:02:53.360 you lose like a
00:02:54.480 lit these little incremental steps they
00:02:57.360 slide
00:02:58.159 and people go oh god what's the big deal
00:03:00.400 what do you care
00:03:01.360 and you're like i see where this is
00:03:02.879 going like i said there's so
00:03:04.800 this is it's going down that way this is
00:03:07.840 not gonna stop
00:03:08.800 it's sliding oh yeah and you saw it in
00:03:11.360 l.a i mean i've lived in l.a my whole
00:03:13.200 life
00:03:13.599 and the the move from la being a
00:03:16.800 pretty safe fairly nice city suburban
00:03:19.680 orientation to
00:03:20.800 just overrun with with horror shows
00:03:24.159 is really it was a lot faster than i
00:03:26.400 thought it would be but
00:03:27.200 it's sort of a you're right it's a
00:03:28.319 gradual decline and then it's just off a
00:03:29.599 cliff well you started to see
00:03:31.120 tents and you didn't see them at all
00:03:34.159 for decades and then all of a sudden i
00:03:36.720 started seeing tents i remember
00:03:38.000 i was doing fear factor in skid row in
00:03:40.720 the early 2000s we would film down there
00:03:43.120 and i'd be like this is crazy
00:03:44.959 like has anybody seen this does anybody
00:03:46.879 know this because there was these
00:03:47.840 homeless
00:03:49.280 streets like you go down these gigantic
00:03:51.680 and downtown l.a back then for people
00:03:53.920 don't live in la you would think oh
00:03:55.280 downtown's like downtown new york or
00:03:56.879 downtown cleveland
00:03:58.080 no downtown la was uh no man's land
00:04:00.640 nothing's going on in downtown l.a
00:04:02.159 it is now like there's what was
00:04:05.040 pre-covered
00:04:06.400 it was like there was some bars and
00:04:08.239 there was some really cool upscale
00:04:09.599 apartment buildings it was kind of
00:04:11.360 picking up
00:04:12.480 but uh i took my family there before
00:04:15.040 kovid like
00:04:15.840 a few four months before covert or so we
00:04:18.079 went to we we're gonna go to there's a
00:04:19.918 famous donut place there
00:04:21.600 so we said just uh one of those goofy
00:04:23.680 sunday things like what do you guys want
00:04:24.880 to do today let's go get donuts
00:04:26.400 so we went to downtown l.a like holy
00:04:28.400 [ __ ] literally [ __ ]
00:04:30.720 human [ __ ] on the streets everything
00:04:33.440 smelled like piss
00:04:34.720 bums everywhere and i'm like okay stay
00:04:36.800 close to me stay over here
00:04:38.720 if anybody comes near you move move
00:04:40.479 closer to me like jesus christ like this
00:04:42.560 is crazy i don't want him to be freaked
00:04:44.320 out but i'm like this is nuts well the
00:04:45.919 thing is that that sort of disaster area
00:04:48.320 stuff in l.a was sort of localized right
00:04:50.400 it really like i worked in the lida's
00:04:52.160 office for a summer when i was when i
00:04:53.680 was in law school it's been like 2007
00:04:55.520 says a while ago
00:04:56.880 and i remember they had a giant tent
00:04:58.560 city and you had to walk from
00:05:00.000 the car they made you park a mile away
00:05:01.759 and walk it and so you were walking
00:05:02.880 through skid row
00:05:04.000 and it's like okay well this this is
00:05:05.600 really terrible and honestly i feel bad
00:05:07.360 for these people because i don't think
00:05:08.160 the best solution for people who are
00:05:09.280 drug addicted or mentally ill is to live
00:05:10.639 on the street and a heavy percentage of
00:05:12.160 people who are homeless are drug
00:05:13.360 addicted or mentally ill
00:05:14.880 but you know is it for for people who
00:05:17.039 are living in the suburbs like this is
00:05:18.080 at least localized it's not like
00:05:19.120 reaching into your life
00:05:20.160 and then over the past 13 years like i
00:05:21.759 live in a pretty decent suburban area
00:05:24.080 and i'm seeing like open needles on the
00:05:25.520 street and walk out of my house one day
00:05:26.880 there's just a guy lying face down in
00:05:28.479 the gutter like edgar allan poe
00:05:31.360 and i thought well this is this is
00:05:32.880 falling apart rather quickly
00:05:34.400 what do you think caused the slide or
00:05:37.199 the
00:05:37.520 expansion of the slide because i agree
00:05:39.840 with you that it was very
00:05:41.280 it was very isolated skid row was very
00:05:44.400 isolated downtown l.a was very i
00:05:46.000 remember one time we were filming in
00:05:47.440 downtown l.a
00:05:48.560 and we were on a gurney or i guess
00:05:50.400 that's one of those things called
00:05:52.639 where it lifts up oh all right anyway
00:05:54.960 we're filming some fear factor stunt
00:05:57.039 and as we got up we could see people
00:05:59.120 smoke and crack
00:06:00.160 and i go look there's people smoking
00:06:01.600 crack right there and the the guests
00:06:04.080 on the show like a lot of them they fly
00:06:05.600 from all over the country and they're
00:06:06.639 like is that real
00:06:07.600 they're really smoking crack going
00:06:08.960 that's crack that's a homeless person
00:06:10.880 smoking crack
00:06:11.759 welcome to l.a it's right there but i
00:06:13.759 didn't feel bad about it i felt like
00:06:15.280 look
00:06:16.240 it's unfortunate but this is not like
00:06:18.479 indicative of all of la
00:06:20.080 we're just in a shitty spot because it's
00:06:21.520 really cheap to film here right here you
00:06:23.039 go
00:06:23.600 you know you got a little gift you get
00:06:24.880 to see some weird [ __ ] while you're here
00:06:26.720 but
00:06:27.039 i didn't i didn't think it was ever
00:06:28.960 going to get to the point where you're
00:06:30.720 on
00:06:31.120 like winnetka off the 101 and there's 80
00:06:34.400 [ __ ] tents and they put a porta potty
00:06:36.720 there they put a port-a-potty
00:06:38.880 we're doing real building and real
00:06:40.160 development here in los angeles
00:06:42.160 not apartment buildings we got some
00:06:43.440 porta-potties we put every underpass
00:06:45.360 shall have a port-a-potty
00:06:46.720 thanks to mayor eric garcetti you pay
00:06:49.039 attention to
00:06:50.000 politics far more than i do and and law
00:06:53.360 enforcement and all that
00:06:54.240 what happened how did it get to this
00:06:56.800 well on this particular problem this
00:06:58.319 actually started with a bunch of
00:06:59.120 lawsuits so the lapd used to have the
00:07:01.199 authority to move people's [ __ ] if it
00:07:02.479 was on the sidewalk
00:07:03.680 if people had a bunch of stuff that was
00:07:04.800 on the sidewalk and they're just camping
00:07:06.000 out there the lapd could come they could
00:07:07.840 take their stuff away
00:07:08.960 and they could rouse them or they could
00:07:10.400 arrest them for trespass or for
00:07:12.000 loitering
00:07:12.880 and then the aclu actually sued and they
00:07:14.400 said that this is a violation of
00:07:15.599 people's personal property
00:07:16.800 oh and the courts tell you you do such
00:07:18.400 good work sometimes and the court's
00:07:20.080 ruled that you actually are not allowed
00:07:21.440 to move people's stuff that that's
00:07:22.720 actually personal property
00:07:24.080 even though it's in a public area and
00:07:25.520 then they got a ruling from a court that
00:07:26.800 you're allowed to live in your car
00:07:27.680 because for a while you weren't allowed
00:07:28.560 to live in your car and then it was
00:07:29.520 you're allowed to live in your car
00:07:30.639 so now you're basically allowed to leave
00:07:32.479 your stuff on the sidewalk and the
00:07:33.440 police are not allowed to move it
00:07:34.720 and you're allowed to live in your car
00:07:36.400 and then
00:07:37.759 there was this sort of equity movement
00:07:39.919 that said okay well things do it in
00:07:41.199 business districts but
00:07:42.560 why can't they do it in like more
00:07:44.160 suburban areas why can't they just move
00:07:45.840 into nicer areas after all if there's
00:07:47.599 misery it should be equally spread
00:07:48.800 across the city
00:07:49.919 and and that's kind of what you're
00:07:51.520 seeing i mean this is there have been so
00:07:53.199 many breaking points over the last year
00:07:54.400 in the city and for me
00:07:55.840 for me and my wife i mean we looked at
00:07:57.520 the rioting and they shut down the
00:07:59.360 entire city at 6 p.m it's a county of 12
00:08:01.840 million people
00:08:02.639 and they shut down the entire county so
00:08:04.400 that douche bags could run around
00:08:05.759 shattering windows pretending that they
00:08:07.120 were standing up for social justice
00:08:08.720 they shut down beverly hills at then
00:08:11.039 rodeo drive 1pm
00:08:11.840 1pm so that people could run up and down
00:08:14.160 rodeo drive talking about how capitalism
00:08:15.840 sucks while
00:08:16.800 tweeting from their iphone while
00:08:18.000 stealing stealing nikes
00:08:20.080 you know there was two moments where i
00:08:22.160 was like this is a real opportunity for
00:08:23.759 us to come together and one of them was
00:08:25.919 the moment the lockdown happened
00:08:28.319 it it felt to me very similar to right
00:08:31.520 after 9 11 where everybody was
00:08:33.200 confronted with their own mortality
00:08:34.958 like holy [ __ ] like we we
00:08:38.000 might be on the verge of a pandemic like
00:08:40.240 in a movie
00:08:41.120 where a lot of the people we know die
00:08:43.120 and here
00:08:44.159 we we have to be kind to each other we
00:08:45.600 have to be this is what's important
00:08:46.880 family is important
00:08:47.839 and i remember thinking i've never been
00:08:49.440 closer to my family
00:08:50.880 never been closer to my friends we're
00:08:52.399 calling each other all the time we were
00:08:54.240 it was like it was a there was there was
00:08:56.480 real hope in that i was like if
00:08:58.320 we get through this we're going to be
00:08:59.839 tighter we're going to know what means
00:09:01.120 something what counts
00:09:02.399 [ __ ] stand up comedy [ __ ] everything
00:09:04.880 else man
00:09:05.839 what's important is love and friendship
00:09:08.880 then it started to get angry
00:09:12.399 it only took like three or four weeks
00:09:14.800 where people started getting
00:09:16.160 like they were scared so people started
00:09:17.920 getting shittier with each other online
00:09:19.839 and then i basically swore off twitter i
00:09:22.480 was like this is just too
00:09:24.080 toxic and too hostile the second moment
00:09:27.760 where i thought we had the opportunity
00:09:28.880 to come together was george floyd
00:09:31.040 so george floyd died and all of a sudden
00:09:34.160 you have these black lives pro matter
00:09:35.760 protests and and i'm like
00:09:37.600 maybe we can finally make a dent on
00:09:40.640 racism maybe we can finally make a dent
00:09:43.279 in police brutality maybe this is a
00:09:45.360 moment where we can come together
00:09:47.200 and realize what's important is
00:09:48.399 community solidarity that
00:09:50.800 we we we're all in this together like
00:09:52.480 this is crazy and then the cops need to
00:09:54.480 be reformed like they can't live like
00:09:56.240 and maybe we should take into into
00:09:58.000 account ptsd maybe we should take into
00:10:00.160 account the fact that these [ __ ] guys
00:10:01.440 are
00:10:01.839 pulling up on people every day that
00:10:03.519 might shoot them in the face they might
00:10:04.800 never be able to see their family and
00:10:05.920 their kids
00:10:06.560 let's rework this let's think this [ __ ]
00:10:08.640 through
00:10:10.079 nope then chaos and then all of a sudden
00:10:12.000 it became like
00:10:13.279 what we saw yesterday where they're
00:10:14.800 breaking into amazon
00:10:16.320 go in seattle like that [ __ ] guy
00:10:19.440 owns the washington post he owns the
00:10:21.920 most
00:10:22.720 left-wing newspaper in america and
00:10:25.760 you're like not good enough well you saw
00:10:27.839 they set up a
00:10:28.399 like a fake guillotine outside of
00:10:29.440 beethoven's house in washington dc it's
00:10:31.279 insane and
00:10:32.079 it's it's just it's madness i'm too rich
00:10:34.079 i totally agree with you by the way like
00:10:35.440 when
00:10:35.760 when the when covet happened i thought i
00:10:37.600 can't really see how we're going to
00:10:38.480 split in partisan fashion over this
00:10:40.079 thing right like
00:10:41.040 everybody wants to live and everybody
00:10:42.640 would also like to eventually get back
00:10:44.480 to regular life
00:10:45.519 and the better we can live the better we
00:10:46.800 can get back to regular life so it seems
00:10:48.320 like
00:10:48.959 okay we're on board when it came to the
00:10:50.560 lockdowns the original lockdowns i was
00:10:52.240 like okay i'm on board you know i'm
00:10:53.839 taking this thing really seriously i've
00:10:55.120 got parents in there in their 60s i feel
00:10:56.720 like
00:10:57.040 you know i'm in good health i'm fairly
00:10:58.880 young i'm 36
00:11:00.079 but for my parents i don't want my
00:11:01.519 parents getting this thing and so we're
00:11:02.959 still taking this thing real seriously i
00:11:04.640 mean i'm still wearing a mask around to
00:11:06.000 public places and i think people should
00:11:07.360 i think that's a responsible thing to do
00:11:08.800 but it immediately turned into who can
00:11:11.040 we blame for this who can we blame
00:11:12.560 who's doing it wrong and it seems like
00:11:14.320 there are only like a couple
00:11:15.839 of things that you really can do that
00:11:17.440 are obviously wrong like nobody has a
00:11:19.200 good solution on this thing okay it
00:11:20.720 ravaged
00:11:21.440 italy it ravaged spain it ravaged new
00:11:24.240 york like
00:11:25.200 there are a couple things you shouldn't
00:11:26.000 do don't take the olds and send them
00:11:27.120 back into the nursing homes with coveted
00:11:28.320 right
00:11:28.800 that's like an obvious one but beyond
00:11:30.720 that like just staying away from each
00:11:32.640 other
00:11:33.120 and socially distancing and worrying
00:11:34.640 like this is all kind of common sensical
00:11:36.079 stuff that
00:11:36.640 people have known since the flu pandemic
00:11:38.320 event 1918 like nothing nothing has
00:11:39.920 really changed
00:11:40.640 and yet it immediately turned into who
00:11:42.240 can we blame who's who's to blame for
00:11:44.079 all these dead people maybe it's ron
00:11:45.279 desantis or maybe it's cuomo like who
00:11:47.120 who can we blame so that was terrible
00:11:48.720 and then on the floyd stuff
00:11:49.839 i had the same feelings like i don't
00:11:51.440 know a single human being who watched
00:11:52.880 that tape and didn't think okay that guy
00:11:54.160 deserves to go to jail
00:11:55.360 chalvin right the officer in that case
00:11:56.800 and the george foreign everyone and
00:11:59.120 everybody
00:11:59.760 every single person was like yeah that's
00:12:01.279 that's real bad like that's and
00:12:02.800 cops like i know tons of cops i'm
00:12:04.480 friendly with tons of cops and not one
00:12:06.000 of them was like yeah that's good police
00:12:07.200 procedure i'm glad he did that like no
00:12:08.800 one thought that
00:12:09.760 and so when people like okay we're gonna
00:12:11.519 look at police brutality maybe we'll
00:12:13.040 take a look at qualified immunity
00:12:14.639 maybe we'll take a look at police unions
00:12:16.320 and the kind of restrictive covenants
00:12:17.600 that they have with the cities and
00:12:19.040 and how we make sure that everybody
00:12:20.399 knows who the bad cops are so they can't
00:12:21.839 get hired at different places
00:12:23.200 like all those are solutions but they
00:12:25.279 quickly turn from well we don't want to
00:12:26.560 talk about solutions solutions are a bad
00:12:28.240 idea what we need to do
00:12:29.440 is we need to shout about everything we
00:12:31.360 can possibly imagine
00:12:32.880 all at once and you know what instead
00:12:34.720 let's have a conversation about like
00:12:36.320 was george washington a bad guy let's
00:12:38.320 have a conversation instead
00:12:39.920 about like just completely defunding the
00:12:41.519 police we don't have like a responsible
00:12:42.880 conversation
00:12:43.600 about things that make sense we'll talk
00:12:44.880 about like what if we just got rid of
00:12:46.240 the police
00:12:46.959 how crazy is that discussion that
00:12:49.040 discussion uh
00:12:50.160 when when people were really saying
00:12:51.440 defund the police i'm like cooler heads
00:12:52.880 will prevail
00:12:53.920 but they're going to realize and i think
00:12:55.360 they're realizing it now in new york
00:12:56.639 city
00:12:57.120 i mean new york city has had record
00:12:58.639 crime record homicides
00:13:00.240 who would have thought who would have
00:13:01.440 thought de blasio is
00:13:03.440 i mean i would have never i would have
00:13:05.519 never imagined
00:13:06.560 i would look at garcetti and go well
00:13:08.560 he's better
00:13:09.600 that's exactly right
00:13:13.200 i look at garcetti and i look at de
00:13:14.639 plasio i'm like garcetti i'll have him
00:13:16.240 over my house for dinner he's way better
00:13:20.720 so weird he's so you can have protests
00:13:23.760 but only black lives matter protests
00:13:26.320 that one that was that was a solid you
00:13:28.160 know that was that may have been the
00:13:29.680 moment when i realized that we were all
00:13:31.200 effed
00:13:31.839 right it was the moment when like we're
00:13:33.279 in the middle of a global pandemic
00:13:35.040 with hundreds of thousands of people
00:13:36.399 dead and an entire swath
00:13:38.880 of our media and health elites just
00:13:40.720 decided randomly
00:13:42.160 that if you were protesting against
00:13:43.360 lockdown you were very bad right then
00:13:44.560 you were a racist and you're going to
00:13:45.600 get people killed and you should wear a
00:13:46.639 mask and i was like well if you're pro
00:13:48.240 i sort of agree with the mask thing like
00:13:49.600 yeah okay and then
00:13:51.600 you get millions of people in the
00:13:53.519 streets yelling at each other and
00:13:55.199 breathing on each other and spitting on
00:13:56.639 each other
00:13:57.120 and you got health professionals on tv
00:13:58.639 being like well racism is a public
00:14:00.000 health threat i guess that you can do
00:14:01.120 that now it's like
00:14:02.320 what the i know people who died in the
00:14:04.079 hospital of covet and their family could
00:14:05.440 not visit them
00:14:06.320 like they literally died alone in the
00:14:07.680 hospital of covet and family could not
00:14:09.120 visit them and you're telling me
00:14:10.240 that it's deeply important that we have
00:14:11.839 like dance lines this was stuff
00:14:13.120 happening at rallies like dance lines in
00:14:14.720 the streets in new york to fight racism
00:14:16.800 that's deeply important but a daughter
00:14:18.480 being able to visit her dad before he
00:14:19.680 dies that's not important
00:14:20.800 i am but what [ __ ] i am for your
00:14:22.639 freedom to protest i'm 100
00:14:24.560 for your freedom to protest i'm also for
00:14:26.959 your freedom to go to the gym
00:14:28.480 i'm also for your freedom to go to a
00:14:30.480 comedy club if you so choose
00:14:32.000 um for your freedom to go to a
00:14:33.519 restaurant look they figured out how to
00:14:35.279 do restaurants in a lot of places the
00:14:37.040 the servers wear masks
00:14:38.959 and many of them wear face shields you
00:14:41.199 distance the tables apart from each
00:14:42.639 other you do temperature checks you take
00:14:44.240 people's names and addresses down
00:14:46.079 when they enter so that if anybody gets
00:14:48.560 sick if there's any sort of kind
00:14:50.320 and they've been able to do this no this
00:14:51.680 is right the vectors of transmission are
00:14:53.440 typically
00:14:54.399 closed areas people in solid proximity
00:14:57.440 with each other for long periods of time
00:14:59.120 yes right that that's the stuff where
00:15:00.320 people are getting this stuff and
00:15:01.680 i i i trust most americans not like some
00:15:04.639 americans would be dumb asses some
00:15:05.920 people are just dumbasses oh there's a
00:15:06.959 lot of videos
00:15:07.760 oh yes you watch youtube there's plenty
00:15:09.199 of karen's out there how sad is it if
00:15:11.040 your name is karen and you're a good
00:15:12.240 person
00:15:13.440 all the good karen's out there i'm sorry
00:15:15.920 ladies
00:15:16.800 i'm really sorry but it's like this is
00:15:20.320 i made this point online i got
00:15:21.600 shellacked for it but i was pointing out
00:15:23.199 that
00:15:24.000 most americans are wearing masks right
00:15:25.519 now bipolar data 59 of americans say
00:15:27.600 that they always wear a mask when they
00:15:28.800 leave the house
00:15:29.519 and if you look at the map of mask
00:15:30.800 wearing across the board in the places
00:15:32.880 where
00:15:33.279 there are the most cases people are
00:15:34.320 wearing masks that's not i wasn't saying
00:15:36.079 masks don't work i wear a mask i think
00:15:37.759 that
00:15:38.160 the evidence shows that they do
00:15:39.279 something and we don't know that they're
00:15:40.240 not like full protective they're
00:15:41.759 the cloth masks are not as effective as
00:15:43.360 surgical masks which are not as
00:15:44.399 effective as m95s but
00:15:46.000 wear a mask good the point that i was
00:15:47.759 making is people are acting
00:15:49.360 in fairly rational fashion meaning if
00:15:50.880 you think kovit is like around you
00:15:52.399 you're wearing a mask and you're
00:15:53.279 socially distancing so this this idea
00:15:55.360 that
00:15:55.759 gavin newsom knows best how you ought to
00:15:57.519 live your life
00:15:58.880 like i i got some trouble with that
00:16:00.320 especially because california saw the
00:16:01.600 same uptick as texas and florida and
00:16:02.880 california never opened i mean we've
00:16:04.079 been here the whole time california
00:16:05.199 never really opened well we were doing
00:16:06.800 pretty good
00:16:07.519 up until the protests yes everything
00:16:09.440 seemed like it was on an uptick the
00:16:10.800 comedy store was talking to them about
00:16:12.959 becoming an essential business and and
00:16:14.800 opening up because
00:16:15.600 they had opened up bars and they had
00:16:17.440 opened up restaurants
00:16:18.639 and they didn't really have a
00:16:20.000 designation for comedy clubs they they
00:16:22.079 sort of talked about it as a live
00:16:24.720 performance venue but then
00:16:26.480 that puts comedy clubs at the same place
00:16:28.560 as the staples center
00:16:29.600 which sounds crazy right right so like
00:16:31.440 listen we can do this we can just have
00:16:33.279 half capacity
00:16:34.399 temperature checks do it right they're
00:16:36.240 doing it right in a lot of places all
00:16:37.440 over the country
00:16:38.160 we can do this the audience has to wear
00:16:39.920 masks this is totally doable
00:16:41.920 and so they were right about to do that
00:16:43.839 and then post
00:16:45.120 this other thing is we were trying to
00:16:46.560 figure out like is it protest only i
00:16:48.560 think it's bars too
00:16:50.000 yeah the thing about bars is close talk
00:16:52.720 people are
00:16:53.600 talking yeah they're drunk and they're
00:16:55.199 on top of each other i think bars
00:16:56.480 probably have a church significant
00:16:57.680 update
00:16:58.240 lots of singing lots of lots of
00:17:00.480 vocalizing right churches and synagogues
00:17:02.240 were a main vector for this
00:17:03.680 yeah i mean but again these are all
00:17:05.359 things that are fairly common sensical
00:17:06.880 and we can agree on and yet we're
00:17:08.000 beating the hell out of each other
00:17:09.919 over this stuff and there's the
00:17:10.959 suggestion we know what to do if only we
00:17:12.720 just did it this would stop it's not
00:17:13.839 gonna stop
00:17:14.319 okay it's not gonna stop it's a very
00:17:15.599 transmissible disease we don't have a
00:17:17.199 vaccine as long as people are out there
00:17:19.199 it's going to continue to pass wear mask
00:17:21.039 if you're in close proximity with others
00:17:22.799 and that's
00:17:23.439 pretty much it the hospitals are getting
00:17:24.880 better at this thank god yes they are
00:17:26.559 and the crazy thing was that they were
00:17:27.919 saying
00:17:28.720 like the you can only protest if it's a
00:17:31.200 black lives matter protest
00:17:32.640 what about a protest for increasing your
00:17:35.440 immunity
00:17:36.080 what about a protest for educating
00:17:38.080 people to
00:17:39.280 the the the techniques and the
00:17:40.720 strategies for increasing your immune
00:17:42.160 system
00:17:42.640 it is there are they're out there and
00:17:44.559 there's no discussion about this amongst
00:17:46.240 health professionals
00:17:47.280 excuse me amongst politicians if you
00:17:49.520 listen to health professionals
00:17:50.799 people that really understand the human
00:17:52.400 body they'll tell you there's a lot of
00:17:54.000 strategies there's a lot of things you
00:17:55.120 could do first of all eliminate
00:17:56.480 alcohol eliminate caffeine eliminate
00:17:59.039 sugar
00:17:59.600 eliminate all the [ __ ] in your diet
00:18:01.520 start taking vitamin supplements get
00:18:03.440 outside get some vitamin d
00:18:05.520 get get your body healthy exercise do do
00:18:08.640 all these things
00:18:09.360 and you will increase your immune system
00:18:11.520 you increase your body's health
00:18:12.880 you don't hear a word of that all of it
00:18:14.400 is just stay inside
00:18:15.919 lock you know we have to stay apart to
00:18:18.240 keep everybody safe and
00:18:19.760 god damn the number one vector for
00:18:21.600 transmission remains the home
00:18:23.280 right that's still the number one vector
00:18:24.640 in every society is the home people
00:18:26.000 going home and giving it to each other
00:18:27.360 and
00:18:28.000 when they i remember for for me one of
00:18:29.600 the breaking points in la was
00:18:31.039 was when they decided they were going to
00:18:32.480 shut down all open
00:18:34.160 areas they're going to shut down all the
00:18:35.200 parks they're going to shut down all the
00:18:36.240 beaches and i was like what is this well
00:18:38.160 not only that it goes against science
00:18:39.600 because
00:18:40.160 there's been papers that have been
00:18:41.200 studied that show that this virus dies
00:18:43.520 almost instantaneously when it's exposed
00:18:45.760 to sunlight or even artificial sunlight
00:18:48.480 yeah none of it makes any sense but it
00:18:50.480 does feel like bottom line there were a
00:18:51.919 bunch of gaps in american society
00:18:53.440 and then a bad thing happened and all
00:18:55.280 everything just sort of fell apart it
00:18:56.640 was sort of like a house of cards and
00:18:58.000 then
00:18:58.559 there's a little bit of weight put right
00:18:59.679 on top of the house of cards and
00:19:00.799 everything just collapsed in on itself
00:19:02.559 well people are panicking you know
00:19:04.000 they're getting scared and then the
00:19:05.280 economy's collapsing
00:19:06.480 so the economy collapsing at the same
00:19:08.720 time as the george floyd protests
00:19:10.960 led people to start looting and then
00:19:12.880 people that didn't give a
00:19:14.320 [ __ ] about george floyd or black lives
00:19:16.480 matter were just stealing [ __ ]
00:19:18.000 and then this police was letting them
00:19:19.919 steal [ __ ] they were standing down in
00:19:21.919 beverly hills and santa monica literally
00:19:25.039 cops standing there while people are
00:19:26.799 saying i gotta say the media coverage of
00:19:28.799 this stuff is just awful
00:19:30.000 the media were cheering this stuff on
00:19:31.600 and they were simultaneously making two
00:19:33.760 arguments that conflict with each other
00:19:35.200 one was these are mostly peaceful
00:19:36.960 protests first of all mostly peaceful is
00:19:38.480 the most
00:19:39.679 it's it's the loosest most loosely
00:19:41.360 defined arbitrarily applied term in
00:19:43.919 history
00:19:44.960 simpson was mostly peaceful that night
00:19:46.640 oj simpson was mostly peaceful that
00:19:48.480 night for like an hour 15 he was really
00:19:50.400 not peaceful but for the other
00:19:52.000 hours between sunset and sunrise he was
00:19:53.919 unbelievably peaceful like i've never
00:19:55.600 heard this term before where
00:19:56.960 a protest turns into a vast riot you
00:19:59.440 know wrecking all of melrose
00:20:01.039 and everybody's like well it was mostly
00:20:02.799 peaceful what what is that
00:20:05.039 what is that true so how about this how
00:20:07.200 about you either say
00:20:08.080 that the protesters and looters are two
00:20:09.520 different groups of people and we treat
00:20:10.720 them differently if you're protesting
00:20:12.080 that's first amendment activity the
00:20:13.200 minute you shatter a store window you go
00:20:14.400 to jail
00:20:15.039 right that's the way they should run or
00:20:17.200 alternatively
00:20:18.320 if it's if you're saying they're the
00:20:19.679 same group then they need to be treated
00:20:21.200 as law breakers so
00:20:22.320 i i believe the first i believe you're a
00:20:23.760 protester you should be protesting if
00:20:25.120 you're a looter and a rioter
00:20:26.400 then you should go to jail but the media
00:20:28.080 refused to make that distinction and
00:20:29.520 then they act like the cops are the bad
00:20:30.880 guys when they come in to to arrest
00:20:32.400 people
00:20:33.039 who are violating the laws i think it's
00:20:34.159 in portland right now they're trying to
00:20:35.280 burn down the damn courthouse yeah and
00:20:37.280 the and the feds come in and start
00:20:38.720 arresting people and people like this is
00:20:40.320 the gestapo it's like
00:20:41.679 okay speaking as one of the tribe let me
00:20:44.320 say this is not like the gestapo
00:20:46.240 okay like the gestapo was not famous for
00:20:47.919 rolling up on people and then
00:20:49.600 charging them and then if they didn't
00:20:50.720 have a charge releasing them that wasn't
00:20:52.000 like the gestapo's thing
00:20:53.840 i'm sorry but you decided that you want
00:20:56.159 to throw a fire bomb at the federal
00:20:57.679 courthouse
00:20:58.559 and your local mayor said he wasn't
00:21:00.400 going to let the police do anything and
00:21:01.919 so dhs came in and arrested you
00:21:04.880 tough [ __ ] i mean like i'm sorry that's
00:21:06.880 at some point somebody's got to restore
00:21:08.240 some semblance of law and order here
00:21:09.840 well it's it's a weird situation because
00:21:12.640 i don't
00:21:13.280 exactly understand why they're attacking
00:21:15.360 the courthouse
00:21:16.400 i don't exactly understand why they're
00:21:18.159 smashing the windows at amazon go
00:21:20.240 it's it's steve martin right they think
00:21:22.159 they must hate these paint cans
00:21:24.000 really from the jerk right but it's
00:21:28.000 it's it went from this to
00:21:31.280 literally tear down the structure of
00:21:34.159 society
00:21:35.039 well this is where we get into sort of
00:21:36.400 the deep philosophy point and this is
00:21:38.320 this is actually really
00:21:39.760 the the biggest problem right now on the
00:21:41.280 racism point is the shifting definition
00:21:43.280 of racism
00:21:44.159 so i had the unfortunate experience of
00:21:45.840 actually reading one of the best-selling
00:21:46.960 books in the country robin d'angelo's
00:21:48.240 white fragility
00:21:49.200 and let me just tell you a greater pile
00:21:50.799 of horseshit has never been produced by
00:21:52.320 a bevy of horses
00:21:53.520 it is an awful book and it is basically
00:21:55.840 rooted in the same theory as ibrahim
00:21:57.440 kendy's how to be an anti-racist
00:21:59.200 the the basic definition of racism
00:22:01.360 changes in this theory so racism
00:22:03.200 you and i were sitting here discussing
00:22:04.400 racism and the way i define racism is
00:22:06.640 probably the same way you define racism
00:22:08.000 you believe in the inferiority or
00:22:09.440 superiority of a group based on race of
00:22:11.919 an individual based on their membership
00:22:13.200 in that group too right that would be
00:22:14.400 racism
00:22:15.120 i believe that you're inferior or you're
00:22:16.400 superior based on your race end of story
00:22:18.559 right that's that's racist
00:22:19.919 so robin d'angelo and ibram kendi
00:22:22.240 redefine racism to mean
00:22:23.679 any societal structure that results
00:22:26.799 in a racial inequality is itself racist
00:22:29.520 so any structure
00:22:30.799 that results in a not exact proportion
00:22:33.760 between whites and blacks does that make
00:22:35.600 the nba racist
00:22:36.720 exactly exactly the answer is kind of
00:22:39.120 yes except that
00:22:40.240 the nba is not racist because obviously
00:22:41.760 it benefits black people right i mean
00:22:43.200 now
00:22:43.600 the nba is not racist in except it's
00:22:45.760 because it's meritocracy it's the reason
00:22:47.039 the nba is not racist
00:22:48.080 but robin d'angelo and kendy both
00:22:51.200 suggest that meritocracy is an aspect of
00:22:53.200 whiteness
00:22:54.080 they say that meritocracy and individual
00:22:55.679 are aspects of whiteness because
00:22:57.200 these institutions things like
00:22:58.720 meritocracy and individualism
00:23:00.960 and not seeing people's colors these
00:23:02.640 just reinforce hierarchies that end
00:23:04.880 with disparate outcomes and so what they
00:23:07.039 say is in order to be anti-racist
00:23:09.039 you have to want to tear down the entire
00:23:10.559 system they literally say this i'm not
00:23:12.320 i'm not
00:23:13.200 really i know that i'm not
00:23:15.120 misidentifying the argument because
00:23:16.720 again i've read their books the the
00:23:19.120 basic notion
00:23:20.000 that to be anti-racist you have to tear
00:23:21.919 down free markets
00:23:23.039 or you have to tear down free speech or
00:23:25.039 you have to and what that means is of
00:23:26.960 course
00:23:27.360 that any time there's rioting and
00:23:28.559 looting that's really just an expression
00:23:30.000 of outrage at the broader american
00:23:31.440 system
00:23:32.000 and so it justifies that sort of stuff
00:23:33.360 this is why you saw nicole hannah jones
00:23:34.640 the de facto editor of the
00:23:36.159 new york times 1619 project lady
00:23:38.159 tweeting out that she appreciated the
00:23:39.520 people were calling these the 16 19
00:23:41.039 riots
00:23:42.000 because once you say america is rooted
00:23:44.240 in slavery and rooted in evil in a
00:23:45.600 terrible horrible no good very bad place
00:23:47.520 then robbing a shop is just the latest
00:23:49.600 iteration of you fighting the system
00:23:51.440 explain the 1619 correlation to people
00:23:53.760 if you would sure so the 1619 project is
00:23:55.840 is something put forward by the new york
00:23:57.039 times
00:23:57.600 it's not good history there are four
00:23:58.960 pulitzer prize-winning historians who
00:24:00.400 said this is not good history
00:24:01.600 the basic argument is the united states
00:24:02.960 was not founded in 1776 with the
00:24:04.799 principles of the declaration of
00:24:06.000 independence
00:24:06.960 the count the country was actually
00:24:08.480 founded in 1619 with the importation of
00:24:10.960 african slaves to american shores
00:24:12.720 because that's when the first african
00:24:13.760 slave arrived in the united states was
00:24:15.120 1619.
00:24:16.000 so the idea is that the entire history
00:24:18.159 of america
00:24:19.039 is a history of a system that is
00:24:21.360 endemically white supremacist
00:24:23.279 and that all of the declaration of
00:24:24.799 independence is basically a lie that the
00:24:26.400 principles of all men are created equal
00:24:28.240 that was a lie when it was written and
00:24:29.520 it's a lie now
00:24:30.320 that the idea that we have rights that
00:24:32.159 pre-exist government that's a lie
00:24:33.840 all of these things are lies the
00:24:34.799 constitution was built in order to
00:24:36.320 enshrine white supremacy
00:24:37.760 and no evolution has taken place so they
00:24:39.840 they essentially make the argument
00:24:41.200 that from 1619 to 2020 is a continuum
00:24:44.880 racism has gone underground a little bit
00:24:46.799 but it's still there and it's still
00:24:48.320 it's still implicit in all of our
00:24:49.600 systems so the 1619 project has essays
00:24:51.520 blaming
00:24:52.080 literally everything on racism so
00:24:53.919 disparities in maternal mortality
00:24:55.360 between black women and white women
00:24:56.559 which by the way exist in europe and in
00:24:57.919 canada
00:24:58.640 that's due to american racism traffic
00:25:00.559 patterns in the united states
00:25:02.159 is due to systematic american racism
00:25:04.799 every racial disparity
00:25:06.240 is attributable to a system that was
00:25:08.480 rooted in slavery
00:25:09.919 now the traditional notion of america
00:25:11.760 that america was founded in 1776
00:25:13.760 and that the story of america is that
00:25:15.919 america did tolerate
00:25:17.440 the great original sin of slavery up
00:25:19.679 until the civil war and then
00:25:20.720 tolerated jim crow up until the civil
00:25:23.039 rights movement of the 1960s and that is
00:25:24.880 a great stain and a blood on america but
00:25:26.799 the story of america is trying to
00:25:28.720 fulfill the promises of the declaration
00:25:30.320 of independence over time make those
00:25:31.919 promises available to everybody
00:25:33.360 and this isn't my argument this is
00:25:34.480 martin luther king jr's argument when he
00:25:36.080 talks on
00:25:36.559 in the march in washington about
00:25:38.000 fulfilling the promissory note of the
00:25:39.440 declaration of independence he says
00:25:40.799 we're here to cash the check right you
00:25:42.080 issued us the check and then you didn't
00:25:43.440 let black americans be americans
00:25:45.200 we're here to cash the check is the
00:25:46.559 argument frederick douglass the freed
00:25:47.919 slave makes in 1852
00:25:49.360 makes a famous speech before slavery is
00:25:50.960 ended he says july 4th doesn't mean
00:25:52.640 anything to black americans
00:25:53.840 because we're not included in the
00:25:55.120 bargain include us in the bargain
00:25:56.960 the story of america is the declaration
00:25:58.960 of independence those principles that we
00:26:00.720 should all basically
00:26:01.520 still agree on because they're pretty
00:26:02.640 good principles free speech
00:26:04.640 free assembly all the things you see in
00:26:06.159 the constitution
00:26:07.760 that those things brought about greater
00:26:10.400 freedom and prosperity than anything
00:26:11.679 else and helped us overcome
00:26:13.520 the sins that are present in all human
00:26:15.200 societies and were present in the united
00:26:16.559 states in extreme ways as well
00:26:18.320 but that's that's the counter-narrative
00:26:20.240 right the 16-19 project says
00:26:21.760 that all that was basically nonsense and
00:26:23.520 that america's just a history of
00:26:25.520 whites keeping blacks down and that no
00:26:27.679 progress has essentially been made if
00:26:28.960 there is progress it's mostly a lie
00:26:31.360 and so every disparity now can be
00:26:33.679 attributed to historic disparities
00:26:35.360 between white and black
00:26:36.559 is there middle ground d so
00:26:39.760 if we look at 1776 and we look at the
00:26:42.880 declaration of independence and we look
00:26:44.559 at america today in 2020
00:26:47.440 there clearly is some impact
00:26:50.960 in the echoes of slavery and then after
00:26:54.000 that jim crow there's clearly
00:26:55.520 some impact in these deeply impoverished
00:26:57.600 communities that don't seem to advance
00:26:59.840 yes so the to to make the argument about
00:27:02.400 institutional racism
00:27:03.679 there's a couple ways you can read this
00:27:04.640 when people say systemic racism or
00:27:06.159 institutional racism
00:27:07.440 i usually ask them to be a little more
00:27:08.960 specific in what they mean because there
00:27:10.000 are a few ways you can read that one is
00:27:11.600 history has impact of course that's true
00:27:13.600 right that's true for everybody
00:27:14.880 it's true in your family history if you
00:27:16.400 have a grandfather who
00:27:18.240 went to who went to prison on a
00:27:19.679 particular charge that leads to poverty
00:27:21.120 for your parents which led to more
00:27:22.320 poverty for you right
00:27:23.200 people have histories those histories
00:27:24.559 are embedded in their life experiences
00:27:26.240 and that's true for societies as well
00:27:28.000 all of that is for sure true
00:27:29.600 then there's the question as to whether
00:27:30.799 the institutions today are racist
00:27:33.279 and that's not quite the same thing
00:27:34.960 right because history has consequences
00:27:37.120 is not the same thing as saying the
00:27:38.240 rules today are racist
00:27:39.919 because the rules today are not racist
00:27:41.520 actually the rules today are quite not
00:27:42.880 racist
00:27:43.679 so but historically it's fairly recent
00:27:46.880 if you go from the civil rights movement
00:27:48.559 to 2020 we're really not talking about
00:27:50.960 that much time
00:27:51.679 it's about three generations 50 plus
00:27:53.520 years 60 years yeah
00:27:54.960 i mean it's 50 plus right in the world
00:27:57.039 of you know
00:27:58.720 in the best span of human history it's
00:28:00.159 not a very small amount of time right
00:28:02.000 so clearly there's some impact of both
00:28:04.720 racism
00:28:05.360 and then jim crow laws so that that's
00:28:08.399 where i'm saying there's a middle ground
00:28:09.760 yeah
00:28:10.080 and it's independent it is important for
00:28:12.480 people on my side of the conservatives
00:28:14.080 to
00:28:14.399 acknowledge and recognize the importance
00:28:16.559 of of history in people's living
00:28:18.480 situations now
00:28:19.520 and it's important for people on the
00:28:20.559 other side of the aisle to at the same
00:28:21.840 time not attribute every single thing
00:28:24.000 to history because right but people who
00:28:25.840 are bullies something like that
00:28:27.360 there's always like extremes on each
00:28:29.840 position
00:28:30.559 and the truth lies somewhere in the
00:28:32.320 middle yeah but i don't think that it
00:28:33.600 lies as far
00:28:34.480 in in the dead center of that as people
00:28:36.480 i think want it to
00:28:37.840 what i mean by that is the problems that
00:28:40.159 have plagued communities in the united
00:28:41.440 states not just the black community in
00:28:42.559 the united states but problems of racism
00:28:44.000 or problems of sexism
00:28:45.360 the way those get alleviated is people
00:28:46.720 making better choices over time
00:28:48.399 right that is the problem that's the way
00:28:49.840 that those issues get alleviated when
00:28:51.200 jews arrived in the united states in the
00:28:52.720 in the early 20th century to talk of my
00:28:54.240 people
00:28:54.720 when they when they came they were
00:28:56.399 impoverished they didn't speak the
00:28:57.360 language
00:28:58.000 they were banned from country clubs
00:28:59.279 there was open discrimination against
00:29:00.559 them they were banned from harvard right
00:29:02.000 harvard law school had quotas on jews
00:29:04.640 the the way to fight against that is to
00:29:07.600 make
00:29:08.080 good decisions and so the you fight
00:29:11.120 against the system to make sure that the
00:29:12.320 system has
00:29:13.039 rules that apply equally to everyone
00:29:15.039 right but you clearly see that there's a
00:29:17.039 big difference between people coming
00:29:18.559 over here willingly
00:29:20.000 and doing so in order to better their
00:29:22.000 lives versus someone
00:29:24.000 whose ancestors were dragged over here
00:29:26.559 to be sold as property
00:29:28.240 and then dealing with the repercussions
00:29:30.799 of that being your family history
00:29:32.960 and redline laws and all the other
00:29:35.760 things that were put in place to sort of
00:29:37.600 keep them in very specific areas which
00:29:40.159 to this day remain crime-ridden
00:29:42.960 gang-ridden
00:29:44.399 deeply impoverished communities well
00:29:46.640 that's true but the question is how much
00:29:48.159 of that is historic redlining and how
00:29:49.600 much of that is an 18 year old kid today
00:29:51.279 deciding to pipe a gun and shoot
00:29:52.320 somebody but how much of that 18 year
00:29:54.159 old kid today
00:29:55.039 deciding to pick up a gun and shoot
00:29:56.720 somebody is based on him
00:29:58.720 growing up in this [ __ ] up environment
00:30:01.039 where that's what he models where
00:30:02.559 everything around him is crime
00:30:04.480 and gangs and you imitate your
00:30:06.240 atmosphere which what all humans do
00:30:08.000 right but the answer is there's only one
00:30:09.200 way to break that chain what what way is
00:30:11.440 that
00:30:11.760 that way is to not pick up a gun and
00:30:13.039 shoot somebody i think that's a
00:30:14.559 simplistic
00:30:15.520 way of looking at it if you're on the
00:30:17.279 outside of that community and you're not
00:30:18.960 one of those 18 year old kids that grows
00:30:20.880 up
00:30:21.200 with the incredible influence of all the
00:30:23.120 people around him and that's all you see
00:30:25.279 and that's all you know well but the
00:30:27.120 problem is the only way that's going to
00:30:28.480 be
00:30:29.039 the thing that your kid doesn't know is
00:30:30.320 for you not to do it at some point
00:30:31.760 personal agency has to come in some
00:30:33.840 it does because the expectation
00:30:35.760 education and and teaching them
00:30:38.000 about personal agency and and letting
00:30:40.960 them
00:30:41.360 understand that there's a way out of
00:30:42.960 this and that the path that they see
00:30:45.120 being replicated over and over again by
00:30:47.440 these people that wind up dying young
00:30:48.880 that wind up going to jail
00:30:50.320 that there are other options there's a
00:30:52.159 lot of kids that never get that other
00:30:54.320 information or if they get it
00:30:56.000 they get little blips of it but the vast
00:30:58.080 majority of the information the vast
00:30:59.760 majority of the influence they get is
00:31:01.440 terrible well
00:31:02.320 i totally agree with this and this is
00:31:03.679 why i think the worst thing that you can
00:31:05.120 say to a kid
00:31:06.000 is you're born behind the eight ball and
00:31:07.360 no matter what you do you're not gonna
00:31:08.559 succeed
00:31:09.120 right that's literally the worst thing
00:31:10.159 you can say to a kid what you should be
00:31:11.360 saying is look at how your grandfather
00:31:13.360 was born behind the eightfall and look
00:31:15.120 how hard he had to work
00:31:16.399 in order to get ahead and look at all
00:31:17.840 the options that's true though but if
00:31:19.679 your grandfather
00:31:20.799 wasn't ahead didn't get ahead if your
00:31:23.840 grandfather
00:31:24.559 was in and out of jail if your father
00:31:26.640 was in and out of jail everyone around
00:31:28.480 you is like that
00:31:29.360 if there's literally no influence that's
00:31:32.320 positive in your life
00:31:34.159 the idea of saying to a kid like that
00:31:36.080 hey don't pick up a gun and shoot
00:31:37.679 somebody
00:31:38.559 it's way that's way too simplistic a
00:31:41.519 version
00:31:42.159 of of their future in my mind i mean the
00:31:45.039 problem is i don't see an alternative
00:31:46.240 solution
00:31:48.880 i think an alternative solution is there
00:31:51.120 has to be some sort of
00:31:53.080 large-scale intervention in these
00:31:56.240 communities to do something
00:31:58.159 about what what what has already been
00:32:00.480 set in motion and the momentum that
00:32:01.919 keeps continuing decade after decade
00:32:04.080 i don't know what could be done well but
00:32:05.840 that's the problem is that i think that
00:32:07.039 a lot of the solutions that have been
00:32:08.240 proposed have already been tried meaning
00:32:10.159 okay so for example lbj thought that the
00:32:12.559 way to alleviate a lot of these
00:32:13.760 inequalities was the war on poverty
00:32:15.360 and he openly talked about this he
00:32:17.039 talked about he gave a speech very
00:32:18.640 famously in which he said we're trying
00:32:19.840 to guarantee equality
00:32:21.200 of outcome not just equality of
00:32:22.720 opportunity equality of outcome
00:32:24.559 and you can't hold the race where
00:32:26.159 somebody is starting 20 yards behind
00:32:28.159 and then fire the gun and say okay
00:32:29.679 that's an equal race right so you have
00:32:31.360 to get the person who's 20 yards behind
00:32:32.960 to actually get up to the starting lines
00:32:34.320 that they're equal
00:32:35.120 and so the idea was we're going to fight
00:32:36.960 this war in poverty and alleviate
00:32:38.240 poverty
00:32:38.960 largely through transfer payments and
00:32:41.279 and through the government taking a
00:32:42.799 forcible step
00:32:43.840 in favor of alleviating people's lives
00:32:45.519 we've now spent 22 trillion dollars in
00:32:47.120 the war on poverty
00:32:48.000 and we have about the same number of
00:32:49.360 black americans living under the poverty
00:32:50.799 line as we're living under the poverty
00:32:52.000 line
00:32:52.480 by the late 70s the the the real issues
00:32:56.240 that that are inter
00:32:57.360 that are creating intergenerational
00:32:59.039 poverty everyone knows this but remains
00:33:00.799 true
00:33:01.279 the number one predictor of
00:33:02.240 intergenerational poverty in the united
00:33:03.840 states remains single motherhood
00:33:05.200 the single motherhood rate in the black
00:33:06.240 community was 20 in 1960 it is upward of
00:33:08.559 70
00:33:09.200 today that's not unique to the black
00:33:10.720 community by the way it's true in the
00:33:11.519 white community as well the five five
00:33:12.960 percent
00:33:13.679 of white kids were born out of wedlock
00:33:15.360 in 1960 today is upward of 40 percent
00:33:18.080 that is not something has happened and
00:33:20.320 it is not
00:33:21.200 a matter of increased racism that's not
00:33:23.360 happening because of increased racism
00:33:25.279 right that is happening because there's
00:33:27.440 been a
00:33:28.640 cultural change that does not place
00:33:30.960 tremendous emphasis for black or white
00:33:32.559 or for anybody
00:33:33.440 on personal responsibility and personal
00:33:35.039 agency there needs to be a mindset
00:33:36.720 change
00:33:37.120 we do this by the way in all other areas
00:33:38.720 of american life except for
00:33:40.320 the most important decisions in the area
00:33:42.000 of sports nobody does this routine
00:33:43.440 and there is a point shelby steele makes
00:33:44.880 in the area of sports if a kid is not
00:33:47.120 does not have a good jump shot nobody
00:33:48.559 says to him you know what you don't have
00:33:49.440 a good jump shot because your father
00:33:50.559 didn't have a good jump shot his
00:33:51.519 grandfather didn't have a good jump shot
00:33:52.799 and the game is
00:33:53.440 biased against you we say okay if you
00:33:55.200 want to be on the team you're going to
00:33:56.480 have to learn to shoot a jump shot
00:33:58.000 right that that sounds harsh that sounds
00:34:00.080 bad but sports are different
00:34:01.679 and here's why sports are different
00:34:02.960 because sports you enter them
00:34:04.320 independently of your culture
00:34:06.080 you you you base what you're trying to
00:34:09.040 do
00:34:09.440 on the parameters of the rules and the
00:34:11.918 people that you're competing against
00:34:13.199 that's how you look at it so you
00:34:14.560 whatever culture you're from
00:34:16.000 you you walk into this new thing with
00:34:19.199 this very rigid set of rules
00:34:22.399 i don't think white people are good or
00:34:23.520 asians have a monopoly on valuing
00:34:25.199 education or monopoly on hard work or
00:34:26.960 punctuality or anything i think that
00:34:28.239 black people
00:34:28.960 have exactly the the same capacity as
00:34:32.480 any
00:34:32.879 people of any other race to do all of
00:34:34.320 these things and those are the
00:34:35.280 preconditions for success you either
00:34:36.560 meet them or you don't i mean
00:34:37.679 that's true for everybody but don't for
00:34:39.359 success but don't you think
00:34:40.879 that a lot of that is predicated on the
00:34:43.520 environment that you develop in
00:34:45.520 and the people that you're around and
00:34:47.599 the lives that you imitate
00:34:49.359 and the influences that you have around
00:34:50.960 you someone has to do something to
00:34:53.440 influence those kids in a different way
00:34:55.280 look i was very fortunate when i was
00:34:57.280 young that i discovered martial arts and
00:34:59.119 it
00:34:59.599 kept me from being what i could have
00:35:02.079 potentially been
00:35:02.960 a bad kid like it gave me something to
00:35:06.960 focus on
00:35:07.760 there's and i didn't grow up in a bad
00:35:09.839 environment but it wasn't the best
00:35:12.079 there's a lot of people out there that
00:35:13.839 grow up in horrific environments and
00:35:15.440 they never
00:35:16.160 have that thing they never have
00:35:17.839 something they they don't have a father
00:35:20.079 around
00:35:20.640 or they don't have a mother around or
00:35:22.079 whatever whatever bad
00:35:23.839 influences they have are overwhelming
00:35:26.640 and they
00:35:27.119 they don't it's it's very difficult
00:35:30.560 for someone to just air quotes get their
00:35:33.280 [ __ ] together it's very difficult for
00:35:35.200 sure that's why
00:35:36.079 to this day there's so many books about
00:35:38.480 losing weight
00:35:39.359 don't you think everybody wants to lose
00:35:40.880 weight that's fat they do they everybody
00:35:42.960 who's fat wants to be thin
00:35:44.400 they do but it's [ __ ] hard for sure
00:35:46.960 and that's nothing
00:35:48.000 in comparison to changing your whole
00:35:49.680 life but but you would say about
00:35:51.040 somebody losing weight you know what's
00:35:52.240 not useful here is lamenting
00:35:54.000 how bad your family has had it with
00:35:55.359 regard to losing weight like at a
00:35:56.800 certain point if you want to lose the
00:35:57.839 weight you got to figure out a way to
00:35:58.960 lose the weight that's true
00:36:00.240 this is based on the information that i
00:36:02.000 have i have this vast
00:36:04.000 scope of information that i've been able
00:36:05.760 to absorb if you're in these isolated
00:36:08.400 environments and
00:36:09.280 everyone around you is involved in gangs
00:36:11.920 and crime and drugs
00:36:13.599 it's very difficult to model yourself
00:36:16.240 after something that you don't see in
00:36:17.760 real life
00:36:18.560 so totally true totally true and that's
00:36:20.640 why again more information needs to get
00:36:22.560 into areas
00:36:23.599 i agree with a lot of the opportunities
00:36:25.520 that need to be provided by
00:36:27.040 education getting people to be educated
00:36:28.880 outside their local public school would
00:36:29.920 be a good change i mean being able to
00:36:31.200 like move outside your crap local public
00:36:32.960 schools
00:36:33.839 would be good the best influences for
00:36:35.920 kids that grow up in these environments
00:36:37.680 seem to be
00:36:38.720 people that have gotten out and then
00:36:40.960 come back and talk to them
00:36:42.400 right and tell them how to do it but
00:36:44.160 none of this can be done but to go back
00:36:45.760 to the original conversation none of
00:36:47.040 this has to do
00:36:48.000 with telling kids that you live in an
00:36:49.440 evil country that's seeking to keep you
00:36:50.640 down
00:36:51.200 well maybe not but there there has been
00:36:55.200 a very small amount of emphasis placed
00:36:57.920 on
00:36:58.480 taking these impoverished communities
00:37:00.240 and figure out how to engineer them out
00:37:01.920 of this situation
00:37:03.520 that's true so i don't think that's true
00:37:05.119 yeah i mean the amount that we've spent
00:37:06.480 on a federal level and a state level
00:37:08.400 on educational programs and poverty
00:37:10.640 programs over time
00:37:12.400 but on a year-to-year level i mean these
00:37:14.800 are these are enormous quantities of
00:37:16.160 money this is not a mon
00:37:17.119 this is not really a money problem it
00:37:19.520 really is not a money problem in just
00:37:20.880 terms of
00:37:21.440 you could sign everybody a check
00:37:22.480 tomorrow right the predicate so the the
00:37:24.400 predicate for the
00:37:25.200 slavery reparations movement is exactly
00:37:26.720 this sign everybody a 80 thousand dollar
00:37:29.040 check
00:37:29.520 and the problem will be alleviated no it
00:37:31.520 won't i don't think that's i don't think
00:37:33.200 i think they'll spend 80 000 and they'll
00:37:34.800 be right back where they started from
00:37:36.079 but i do think that there is
00:37:37.680 an argument that there can be some way
00:37:40.880 of engineering whether it's community
00:37:42.800 centers or education or doing something
00:37:45.359 differently in these places
00:37:47.040 to chip away at this problem so on that
00:37:49.680 stuff we totally agree
00:37:51.200 the only point that i'm making about the
00:37:52.480 16 19 project is when you teach people
00:37:54.800 that they are the victims of a society
00:37:57.839 it makes it very difficult for them to
00:37:59.599 succeed the story of black america
00:38:02.320 should be a story
00:38:03.359 of unbelievably brave people triumphing
00:38:06.000 over systems that sucked
00:38:07.599 right i mean that that is the story of
00:38:08.960 black america most black americans do
00:38:10.560 not live under the poverty line in the
00:38:11.680 united states
00:38:12.560 there's a huge black middle class
00:38:14.079 there's a black upper class yes there is
00:38:15.599 let's
00:38:16.000 let's simplify this if we can sure if
00:38:18.160 ben shapiro is the king of the world
00:38:19.839 how do you fix baltimore how do you fix
00:38:22.480 detroit how do you fix
00:38:24.560 the south side of chicago okay so here's
00:38:26.960 the unpopular view but it happens to be
00:38:29.200 empirically correct the first thing you
00:38:30.800 have to do is you have to load the place
00:38:32.480 of the police
00:38:33.680 you got to load the place of the police
00:38:34.880 because you have to stop crime once you
00:38:36.400 stop crime
00:38:37.119 then businesses are happy to invest in
00:38:38.640 those areas you're not going to get
00:38:39.760 businesses to invest in those areas and
00:38:41.040 provide jobs unless the crime is gone
00:38:42.720 you need in fact one of the reasons that
00:38:44.640 you have such a vast differential in
00:38:46.000 racial crime in the united states is
00:38:47.440 because of white racism
00:38:48.800 and there's a point that jane levy
00:38:50.079 writer for the la times has made and she
00:38:51.920 writes a book called ghetto side and she
00:38:53.040 points out
00:38:53.760 that the reason that black crime was so
00:38:55.520 high in the early 20th century and late
00:38:56.880 19th century
00:38:58.000 is because basically white communities
00:38:59.520 said to black communities you're on your
00:39:00.800 own
00:39:01.359 right enjoy and so the crime rates ended
00:39:03.760 up spiking because there were no police
00:39:05.040 there
00:39:05.440 you have to make sure that law abiding
00:39:07.359 people are protected that law abiding
00:39:08.720 businesses are protected that people
00:39:10.240 want to live there that people want to
00:39:11.760 invest there
00:39:12.640 you have to have a re-establishment of
00:39:15.040 faith in churches right you need social
00:39:16.480 institutions outside of government that
00:39:18.000 are promoting things
00:39:19.119 like family you need you need more one
00:39:21.920 of the reasons you need more companies
00:39:22.960 in these areas
00:39:23.760 is they can offer educational
00:39:25.359 opportunities to kids internships
00:39:27.440 deals to go to college and then come
00:39:28.960 back and work for us for a couple of
00:39:30.160 years
00:39:30.640 right you need opportunity the same way
00:39:31.920 that opportunity is built anywhere else
00:39:33.520 on earth you need to
00:39:34.640 provide a safe space for business to
00:39:37.440 work and for free speech to flourish
00:39:39.119 and for education to be valued you need
00:39:41.040 to go in you need to make clear to every
00:39:42.960 kid
00:39:43.440 if you graduate high school then you
00:39:45.119 will have a shot at college which by the
00:39:46.560 way is
00:39:47.200 100 true today if you are a black kid
00:39:49.520 and you graduate high school with any
00:39:51.119 level of achievement
00:39:52.240 you will have a very solid shot of at
00:39:53.520 least going to a community college and
00:39:55.280 if you score per
00:39:56.000 even decently on the sats of going to a
00:39:57.760 very high level college right
00:39:58.720 affirmative action programs are
00:39:59.760 extraordinarily common
00:40:01.040 across the united states but the the
00:40:03.040 first message is
00:40:04.480 we are going to ensure that law and
00:40:06.000 order prevail here a safe space for life
00:40:08.000 liberty and property
00:40:09.440 and ownership of private property and we
00:40:11.599 are going to make sure that you as a law
00:40:12.960 abiding citizen have the opportunity to
00:40:14.480 succeed because
00:40:15.200 the biggest obstacle to young black kids
00:40:17.040 growing up in the inner city again
00:40:18.319 is not history it is in the moment the
00:40:20.400 drugs the crime
00:40:22.000 the fact that there are no fathers in a
00:40:23.599 lot of these areas roland fryer black
00:40:25.359 professor at harvard he's done excellent
00:40:26.800 work
00:40:27.359 showing that actually the number one
00:40:29.040 factor in allowing
00:40:30.880 kids to to rise is not even having a
00:40:32.720 father in the home it's how many fathers
00:40:33.839 there are generally in a community
00:40:35.359 so you can you can have a single mom but
00:40:36.800 if there are a lot of other male
00:40:38.480 father figures around that helps fill in
00:40:40.720 the gap right these are practical things
00:40:42.560 giving kids the ability to pick the
00:40:44.160 school they go to so they don't have to
00:40:45.200 go to the local crappy public school if
00:40:46.640 it's a local crappy public school
00:40:48.640 it would be a solution here but this all
00:40:50.560 starts with the notion that
00:40:52.400 it is not racist in the slightest to
00:40:54.560 suggest that law and order have to
00:40:55.920 prevail
00:40:56.640 and that law-abiding people should be
00:40:58.400 protected in their exercise of their
00:40:59.839 rights
00:41:00.240 i think you're 100 right on that and i
00:41:02.000 think although that might be
00:41:03.440 an unpopular opinion i agree with you i
00:41:05.680 think that is very important
00:41:07.280 now what do you do in this environment
00:41:11.119 when you look at the way people distrust
00:41:13.359 the police now
00:41:14.160 in particular i mean i mean i've been
00:41:15.839 reading stories about
00:41:17.520 cops going to five guys burgers and they
00:41:20.079 can't get served because people won't
00:41:21.520 serve cops
00:41:22.480 and this idea that all cops are bad and
00:41:25.040 this is a
00:41:25.920 very really disturbing perspective to me
00:41:28.480 because
00:41:29.280 you're seeing what's happening right now
00:41:31.200 in chicago you're seeing what's
00:41:32.720 happening right now in new york where
00:41:34.480 you have this massive uptick
00:41:36.319 in violent crime because it's perceived
00:41:38.560 that the police presence has been
00:41:40.480 diminished greatly so how do
00:41:43.520 you reaffirm the trust
00:41:47.040 in in in law enforcement and what do you
00:41:49.599 do to reform law enforcement because
00:41:51.920 clearly
00:41:52.560 there are some people that are cops that
00:41:53.920 should not be cops yes there are a few
00:41:55.760 things that you can do right off the bat
00:41:57.280 and that people
00:41:58.000 right left and center have sort of
00:41:59.040 talked about and one of them is that you
00:42:00.720 can abridge qualified immunity in
00:42:02.400 certain areas so qualified immunity is
00:42:03.760 the idea that you're not liable to civil
00:42:05.200 suit
00:42:05.760 if you don't do something bad that has
00:42:08.160 specifically had a precedent
00:42:09.920 in law so you could do something bad but
00:42:12.400 as long as nobody else has done the same
00:42:13.760 exact bad thing before you're not
00:42:15.119 subjected to civil liability
00:42:16.880 you could you could experience it it's a
00:42:18.880 little complicated it's a qualified
00:42:20.000 immunity
00:42:20.720 generally means that if i do something
00:42:23.359 bad then as a police officer if i act
00:42:25.040 within the scope of my general
00:42:26.319 reasonable authority you can't sue me
00:42:27.839 for it
00:42:28.800 the actual way they do something bad
00:42:30.400 what if you shoot somebody while you're
00:42:32.160 operating like right so so the the
00:42:34.240 reason that qualified immunity as
00:42:35.680 currently understood under supreme court
00:42:37.040 doctrine
00:42:37.599 is too broad is because that the
00:42:39.599 standard used to be
00:42:40.720 you would have to act as a reasonable
00:42:42.079 police officer if you acted as a
00:42:43.359 reasonable police
00:42:44.000 officer and you took a reasonable action
00:42:46.000 right somebody went for their waistband
00:42:47.839 they had an object in there you didn't
00:42:49.040 know if it was a gun you shot them
00:42:50.880 right you wouldn't presumably be
00:42:52.640 suitable because that's
00:42:54.079 still reasonable you track a guy down
00:42:55.920 you shoot him in the back you know
00:42:57.760 and then you plant the gun on him that
00:42:59.040 presumably would be suitable right he'd
00:43:00.560 be personally liable
00:43:01.680 so the the the the way that supreme
00:43:04.000 court has done this is they broadened
00:43:05.200 qualified immunity
00:43:06.560 to such an extent that you can still
00:43:08.079 bottom line you can still get away with
00:43:09.200 some bad stuff
00:43:10.160 and not be sued for it so that needs to
00:43:11.520 be curbed that's one thing second
00:43:13.520 police union contracts need to be
00:43:14.880 utterly redone across the country
00:43:17.040 police union contracts right now protect
00:43:18.560 a lot of bad cops right because the
00:43:20.400 police unions are designed to protect
00:43:22.079 the members
00:43:22.640 the members of the union just like any
00:43:23.839 other union yeah and so what that means
00:43:26.000 is that police unions i'm not a fan of
00:43:28.720 public sector unions generally
00:43:30.240 um but police unions need to be abridged
00:43:33.040 in their ability to protect cops who do
00:43:34.560 something wrong
00:43:35.359 third you need to have a national
00:43:36.319 registry of cops who are disciplined
00:43:39.119 for violation of procedure so that they
00:43:41.599 can't just leave
00:43:42.319 lapd and then go work for a ferguson pd
00:43:44.400 right or something those are some easy
00:43:45.920 things that you could do
00:43:47.200 right off the bat but the biggest thing
00:43:49.520 right now the biggest factor in terms of
00:43:51.440 lack of faith between police and and
00:43:54.079 citizens
00:43:55.040 really is the media because there's been
00:43:56.560 a lot of talk about the
00:43:58.160 racial constituency of police forces the
00:44:00.880 the majority of the lapd is minority the
00:44:02.640 majority of the baltimore pd
00:44:03.920 is minority i believe that a huge
00:44:05.839 percentage of the of the chicago pd
00:44:07.760 is minority so it really is not about
00:44:09.760 you know lots of white cops in black
00:44:11.119 neighborhoods in baltimore it's a lot of
00:44:12.560 black cops in black neighborhoods
00:44:13.920 and that has not solved the problem of
00:44:15.680 people mistrusting the police on an
00:44:17.440 endemic level
00:44:18.480 well it's an inherently difficult job a
00:44:21.200 it's a rotten job man i mean i've
00:44:23.200 i have nothing but for for good cops
00:44:25.200 those they're heroes and the vast
00:44:26.640 majority of cops are good cops and
00:44:27.760 they're heroes yeah i read
00:44:28.960 uh a a meme the other day that's very
00:44:31.119 accurate it said if you have
00:44:32.720 a 130 good cops and 12 cops
00:44:36.240 you have or 12 cops that are bad you
00:44:38.000 have 12 bad cops if you have 130
00:44:41.040 good cops and 12 bad cops but the 130
00:44:45.119 won't do anything about the 12 bad cops
00:44:47.680 you've got 142 bad cops yeah
00:44:50.480 and i think that that's right i think
00:44:51.839 that's right i i think that it is also
00:44:53.839 true
00:44:54.480 that our standard of what constitutes a
00:44:56.160 bad cop has
00:44:57.520 in some ways become much more stringent
00:45:00.960 so for example
00:45:01.760 there are cases that become national
00:45:03.040 stories in which a cop was labeled a bad
00:45:05.040 cop it wasn't a bad cop
00:45:06.240 right but there are bad cops for sure
00:45:08.480 look look here's a great example
00:45:10.480 the the cops that pushed down that old
00:45:12.800 man and and where was it buffalo new
00:45:14.560 york is that where it was yep
00:45:15.920 granted yep that's [ __ ] crazy i mean
00:45:18.480 and that's
00:45:19.040 white on white crime right i mean uh is
00:45:21.599 a white guy
00:45:22.640 pushes this old man down and
00:45:25.760 the most bonkers part about that was the
00:45:27.280 way the president reacted like oh the
00:45:29.040 way he felt sam
00:45:30.000 seemed funny maybe he was antifa yeah
00:45:31.839 maybe he was undercover like
00:45:33.119 there was literally the worst possible
00:45:36.000 reaction
00:45:36.800 to watching an elderly senior citizen
00:45:39.680 get pushed down by a young
00:45:41.040 strong man you mean president trump had
00:45:42.640 the worst possible reaction to a thing
00:45:44.839 worse
00:45:46.319 yeah i mean unknown president trump
00:45:48.000 having bad reactions look i'm i'm a big
00:45:49.760 supporter of law enforcement i have a
00:45:51.280 lot of friends that are cops i know a
00:45:52.560 lot of friends
00:45:53.440 a lot of people from martial arts that
00:45:55.040 are cops from the ufc
00:45:56.560 i know a lot of cops from jiu jitsu i
00:45:58.640 knew a lot of cops growing up from
00:46:00.400 all the different martial arts
00:46:01.760 disciplines that i engaged in a lot of
00:46:03.440 cops get involved in that
00:46:04.960 there's a lot of good cops there's a lot
00:46:06.319 of good people out there but it is a
00:46:07.599 [ __ ] insane job and
00:46:09.280 so many of them have ptsd for sure and
00:46:11.760 but
00:46:12.400 i will say that one of the great myths
00:46:13.920 is that the big threat to the black
00:46:15.200 community in the united states is law
00:46:16.400 enforcement it's just nonsense
00:46:18.000 it's not only nonsense it's
00:46:18.880 counterproductive nonsense and you're
00:46:20.319 seeing it but it is a plan right
00:46:21.920 it is a threat off all these times it is
00:46:23.839 on a data level an extraordinarily small
00:46:26.000 threat
00:46:26.960 law enforcement law enforcement is a
00:46:28.800 threat to black life on a generalized
00:46:30.800 level is extraordinarily small the
00:46:32.160 washington post database last year
00:46:33.599 showed a grand total of 15
00:46:35.680 black americans shot unarmed across the
00:46:38.160 united states in a country of 42 million
00:46:40.000 black people the problem is
00:46:41.520 when it happens it doesn't matter what
00:46:43.680 the statistics are if people see that
00:46:45.520 video
00:46:46.160 and that video gets shared 200 million
00:46:48.160 times it looks like there's 200 million
00:46:51.599 white cops killing a black guy well and
00:46:53.760 this is why i say that the media's
00:46:55.280 treatment of this stuff is just horrific
00:46:56.800 it's not just the media it's
00:46:58.319 it's social media social social media
00:47:00.480 has blown this stuff up
00:47:01.680 and it's gotten to the point where if
00:47:03.359 you say that's a horrible situation
00:47:05.359 that's also an anecdotal situation
00:47:06.640 here's some data
00:47:07.599 if you present the data it's like well
00:47:09.040 you're are you ignoring people's lived
00:47:10.640 experiences that's racist how can you
00:47:12.079 present the data the data is
00:47:13.599 the data doesn't take into account the
00:47:15.200 full story nobody takes into account an
00:47:16.880 awful lot of the story which is why it's
00:47:18.079 called data
00:47:19.040 right like i just don't anecdotal
00:47:21.359 evidence
00:47:22.079 is evidence of an anecdote it is not
00:47:24.079 evidence of a broad national trend nor
00:47:26.079 is it evidence
00:47:26.880 that taking a broad national policy like
00:47:28.720 cutting back funding to the police in a
00:47:30.160 time of rising crime
00:47:31.440 is a good idea because you saw a video
00:47:33.119 on youtube i'm sorry
00:47:34.720 that's a terrible idea but when you look
00:47:37.200 at these videos
00:47:38.480 the positive side if there is any
00:47:40.319 positive side
00:47:41.520 is that it's they're accountable now
00:47:44.880 and this has been going on forever if
00:47:46.319 you talk to people that are black that
00:47:47.680 grew up in
00:47:48.400 in poverty stricken areas
00:47:51.760 they will tell you horrific stories
00:47:54.079 about being abused by cops
00:47:55.839 and i think the number is like 25
00:47:58.480 percent more likely
00:47:59.920 a black person or brown person getting
00:48:04.160 any sort of interaction with a cop is 25
00:48:06.640 more likely to become physical or for
00:48:08.240 them to be abused
00:48:09.520 that's that's real right when you look
00:48:11.520 at the statistics of
00:48:12.640 them being killed yeah white people get
00:48:14.319 killed more by cops
00:48:15.680 than black people but there's way more
00:48:16.960 white people no no even on a percentage
00:48:18.800 basis when
00:48:19.680 you have to use the control group of
00:48:20.960 crime you can't use the control group of
00:48:22.240 raw population
00:48:23.200 so you have to look at people who are in
00:48:24.720 situations where a deadly
00:48:27.119 interaction is likely there have been
00:48:28.559 multiple studies that show that black
00:48:29.839 people are not in more danger of being
00:48:31.119 shot by cops than white people but
00:48:32.800 it is true that low-level uses of force
00:48:34.480 between cops and black people are worse
00:48:36.480 than low-level uses of force between
00:48:37.760 cops and white people right that's the
00:48:38.800 role in friar study
00:48:39.839 there are a few confounds that have yet
00:48:41.119 to be sort of worked out i think
00:48:42.720 probably white people are
00:48:43.760 less likely to believe that the cops
00:48:45.520 gonna kill them whereas black people are
00:48:47.359 probably convinced the cops going to
00:48:48.800 kill them that might
00:48:49.680 that might play a factor in why there's
00:48:51.440 more white people being killed by cops i
00:48:52.960 mean that may very well be true it may
00:48:54.400 also be that low-level uses of force is
00:48:56.400 maybe
00:48:57.119 of force may be disparate if you think
00:48:58.559 that the cops likely to be a racist
00:49:00.720 then you might be more likely to resist
00:49:02.240 the cop and then he might be more likely
00:49:03.920 to rough you up so
00:49:04.800 it's it's very difficult to rub out the
00:49:07.520 confounds there the one thing that we
00:49:08.960 know for sure
00:49:09.920 is that the greatest threat to black
00:49:12.640 life just like the greatest threat to
00:49:13.760 white life
00:49:14.559 is members of your own race killing you
00:49:16.319 like if you're talking about actual
00:49:17.680 murders
00:49:18.720 white people are killed by white people
00:49:20.000 black people are killed by black people
00:49:21.119 by people you know
00:49:22.079 mostly right it's intraracial right
00:49:23.680 there is there there's very little
00:49:24.960 interracial crime like black on white or
00:49:26.720 white on black in the united states
00:49:28.240 there's a lot of intra-racial crimes a
00:49:29.839 lot of white people victimizing white
00:49:31.040 people and black people victimizing
00:49:32.400 black people
00:49:33.040 and the question is how do you stop that
00:49:34.720 this is why i don't know if you saw this
00:49:36.400 interview it was kind of an amazing
00:49:37.440 interview terry crews the actor yeah he
00:49:39.119 was on with uh his own don lemon
00:49:41.119 right and don lemon uh is doing the
00:49:43.280 black lives matter
00:49:44.240 sloganing and terry crews says well all
00:49:46.720 lives matter
00:49:47.839 and don lemon says but no black lives
00:49:51.280 matter doesn't mean all black lives
00:49:52.720 matter
00:49:53.520 right but terry crews said all black
00:49:54.880 lives matter and he said no no not all
00:49:56.240 black lives matter only black lives
00:49:57.359 matter we're only talking about police
00:49:58.480 brutality right now
00:49:59.440 and terry crews was like why aren't we
00:50:00.720 talking about all black lives matter
00:50:02.160 because
00:50:02.960 if black lives matter means you withdraw
00:50:04.640 cops and withdrawing cops means more
00:50:06.319 dead black people
00:50:07.440 then why wouldn't those lives matter too
00:50:10.000 and
00:50:10.480 this is where the slogan nearing gets in
00:50:12.960 the way of
00:50:13.599 actual progress because that's where
00:50:14.960 ideology hits facts right
00:50:16.640 exactly it gets very weird and terry
00:50:18.640 crews was called
00:50:19.760 some terrible names for that but then a
00:50:21.440 video surfaced of don lemon from 2013
00:50:24.480 chastising sounds like me on that right
00:50:26.160 he sounds like me he talks he sounds
00:50:27.680 exactly like you it's hilarious pull
00:50:30.000 your pants up get your [ __ ] together
00:50:32.000 you know like he's literally saying
00:50:33.920 things like don't have babies out of
00:50:35.520 wedlock
00:50:36.079 right stay in school which by the way
00:50:38.319 again all of this is commonsensical and
00:50:39.760 true for all races it is not just black
00:50:41.760 people
00:50:42.240 young white people in appalachia need to
00:50:43.680 get their [ __ ] together yes everybody
00:50:45.280 needs to get their [ __ ] together but
00:50:46.480 again young white people in appalachia
00:50:48.480 are dealing with the same thing what's
00:50:50.000 around them all the time is crime
00:50:52.160 people taking pills everyone having
00:50:54.720 babies out of wedlock
00:50:55.920 people impoverished no hope no
00:50:59.200 no potential for escape i mean
00:51:02.319 that i agree but the first thing that
00:51:03.599 has to change the firs so my dad had a
00:51:06.160 when i was you know looking to get
00:51:07.599 married my dad said the way that you get
00:51:09.040 married
00:51:09.599 is it's not that you find a girl and
00:51:10.960 then you decide to get married you
00:51:11.839 decide to get married and then you find
00:51:12.800 a girl
00:51:13.520 meaning that you you have to sort of
00:51:14.720 make up your mind that you're in that
00:51:16.000 you're in the mode
00:51:17.040 of this might be where we disagree the
00:51:20.839 most
00:51:22.079 a good way to get hooked up with the
00:51:23.280 wrong lady bro well you make the life
00:51:25.200 decision that you're at that point in
00:51:26.319 your life when you want to make a
00:51:27.200 decision
00:51:27.920 along those lines get married when you
00:51:30.240 love a girl so much you're willing to do
00:51:32.000 something so
00:51:32.720 [ __ ] stupid that you're willing to
00:51:34.160 get married to her because
00:51:36.000 getting married to her is how is where
00:51:37.920 we're going to get married less
00:51:39.200 painful to you than the idea of losing
00:51:42.640 that person
00:51:43.359 because i look i think marriage
00:51:46.800 the good thing about it is that there's
00:51:49.440 financial
00:51:50.000 protection for the family financial
00:51:52.400 particularly when there's children
00:51:53.520 involved i think that's when it's the
00:51:54.559 most important thing
00:51:55.680 you know i think financial protection
00:51:57.520 for the children look
00:51:59.119 i grew up without child support my
00:52:01.680 father was a deadbeat dad
00:52:03.200 so i know what it's like to be poor
00:52:04.720 because your father doesn't support you
00:52:06.880 i think that's horrific i've seen it in
00:52:09.359 many situations i know many people that
00:52:11.839 have been the victim of this
00:52:13.359 it's disgusting there are a lot of
00:52:15.599 shitty men out there
00:52:16.640 that don't take care of their kids white
00:52:19.119 black
00:52:19.920 asian it's universal that
00:52:22.960 needs i think that is where the legal
00:52:25.599 definition of marriage
00:52:26.960 and protection of children and
00:52:29.200 protection of the woman who has to take
00:52:30.559 care of these children financially
00:52:32.160 i think that's significant when it comes
00:52:34.480 to
00:52:35.200 bringing the state in to
00:52:38.319 somehow another solidify your love like
00:52:41.359 you know i love you you love me but
00:52:43.119 let's bring in a bunch of [ __ ] people
00:52:44.400 we don't know and write it down on paper
00:52:46.240 that's nonsense well i totally agree
00:52:47.680 with that obviously but the point that
00:52:49.200 i'm making is that
00:52:50.160 when you want to make a change in your
00:52:51.200 life you first have to commit that you
00:52:52.400 want to make the change before you make
00:52:54.000 the change well sometimes you meet
00:52:55.200 someone that's why you want to make a
00:52:56.480 change no they attempt for them
00:52:57.839 okay so not to get into marital advice
00:52:59.359 here but like
00:53:01.760 but i have some you know i've been
00:53:04.079 married for for 12 years at this point
00:53:05.839 thank god very happy marriage we have
00:53:07.119 three kids
00:53:07.760 and the the reason that i say you have
00:53:10.160 to make up your mind that you want to
00:53:11.119 get married before you get married
00:53:12.720 is because you look for a different set
00:53:14.079 of factors then if you are if you are
00:53:16.160 if you make up your mind you want to get
00:53:17.119 married what you're going to look for is
00:53:18.240 commonality of values who is the person
00:53:19.920 you want to build your life with
00:53:21.359 do you share interest you share a vision
00:53:24.480 for the future
00:53:25.440 whereas if you sort of fall into it then
00:53:27.200 you can fall in love with somebody you
00:53:28.640 don't share any of these things with and
00:53:29.760 it makes it a lot more difficult later
00:53:31.040 on to actually don't think they'll like
00:53:32.640 true i don't think you fall in love with
00:53:34.640 someone that you don't share
00:53:35.680 values with i think you you think
00:53:37.440 they're hot and you want to [ __ ] them
00:53:39.359 people makes this stuff up pretty
00:53:40.480 regularly well people are silly people
00:53:42.400 are indeed silly people do
00:53:43.680 people tattoo their eyeballs ben they do
00:53:45.920 a lot of dumb [ __ ]
00:53:47.440 you live in a world i don't man that's
00:53:50.160 not my world
00:53:51.359 i don't have any friends with eyeballs
00:53:52.880 tattooed but people
00:53:54.960 make mistakes with they get attracted to
00:53:57.839 someone physically
00:53:59.200 and you know particularly men are and i
00:54:01.920 guess women too i'm just not one of them
00:54:03.680 are attracted oftentimes by people they
00:54:06.319 think are sexy
00:54:07.440 but are a bad choice in terms of a life
00:54:10.000 partner
00:54:10.559 right but i don't think you fall in love
00:54:11.920 with those people they just become
00:54:13.839 how many times you married a girl just
00:54:15.280 because they thought they were hot
00:54:17.040 a lot a lot a lot men period
00:54:20.640 it's not just jews like the drug of
00:54:23.040 sexual attraction
00:54:24.640 is the most sold drug in the united
00:54:27.359 states it it sells
00:54:28.880 cars it sells homes it's literally it
00:54:32.240 sells
00:54:32.720 lifestyles pornography yeah but that
00:54:36.079 what is that i mean when you're seeing a
00:54:37.599 woman with a short skirt on and long
00:54:39.839 legs
00:54:40.480 walking like like lustfully around a car
00:54:44.400 what do you what is she what are you
00:54:45.520 saying you're saying if you buy this car
00:54:46.960 maybe you can [ __ ] this girl
00:54:48.480 that's what you're saying well of course
00:54:49.920 the worst [ __ ] false advertising we
00:54:52.799 have in america but
00:54:53.839 this is why when it comes to marriage i
00:54:55.200 think that it's important to actually
00:54:57.599 put your large head before before your
00:54:59.599 other one uh you know the
00:55:01.200 jonathan height in his book his book
00:55:02.720 called the happiness hypothesis great
00:55:04.000 book
00:55:04.400 terrific right he and he talks about
00:55:06.000 this right he talks about the fact that
00:55:07.520 people make a very large scale mistake
00:55:09.040 about marriage which is they think that
00:55:10.319 the passion you feel at the very
00:55:11.359 beginning is what you're going to feel
00:55:12.319 40 years in and that's not the way this
00:55:13.760 works it starts off
00:55:14.799 where your passionate love level for
00:55:16.160 somebody meaning like lust and how much
00:55:18.319 you want to get them in bed and how much
00:55:19.359 you want to be with them all the time
00:55:21.119 is it like 100 and your and your level
00:55:23.680 of
00:55:24.240 kind of committed love right that level
00:55:26.640 of love where you have
00:55:27.599 shared values that matters to you like
00:55:29.359 this much and then over time after about
00:55:31.280 like two years the passionate love
00:55:32.480 starts to decline
00:55:33.680 and by the time you're 60 then you
00:55:35.520 better have shared values because
00:55:36.720 after 60 years it ain't going to be like
00:55:38.240 it was when you were 20. right so
00:55:40.160 you have to have in mind what things are
00:55:41.760 going to be like a few years down the
00:55:42.880 road which is why i say you should be
00:55:44.160 thinking about
00:55:45.119 what your life together is going to be
00:55:46.480 like before you fall into bed together
00:55:48.720 that's
00:55:49.119 sound advice but well at sea that's why
00:55:52.000 i disagree
00:55:53.119 because i don't think there's anything
00:55:54.640 wrong with falling into bed with someone
00:55:56.240 that you're not going to live the rest
00:55:57.119 of your life with
00:55:58.160 that's where you and i probably disagree
00:55:59.920 yeah i mean i think that it is a bad
00:56:01.680 idea
00:56:02.079 generally and again i think that it is a
00:56:04.240 bad idea because
00:56:05.119 there's a lot of people out there that
00:56:06.480 have had some really good times with
00:56:07.920 those bad ideas
00:56:09.440 and it may be that when i die i look
00:56:11.040 back and that is one of my great regrets
00:56:12.400 my friend but
00:56:13.359 let me just say that that i think that
00:56:15.680 the
00:56:16.799 the the thing that that has been forgone
00:56:20.640 uh is in my life at least more than made
00:56:23.119 up for by the relationship that i have
00:56:24.319 with my wife
00:56:25.040 so i can i'll go anecdotal there but i
00:56:27.119 also will i'll go data driven which is
00:56:28.720 the longer you live together with
00:56:29.599 somebody before you get married the
00:56:30.559 higher divorce rate after
00:56:31.760 so that's the higher the divorce rate
00:56:33.440 after if you live for a long time with
00:56:35.440 somebody and then you get married
00:56:36.640 there is a higher percentage chance you
00:56:38.559 will end up divorcing that's interesting
00:56:39.839 i wonder why that is
00:56:41.119 probably because of the open window
00:56:42.160 syndrome like people feel like okay i
00:56:43.839 lived with you for three years why
00:56:45.040 aren't we married yet
00:56:45.920 why aren't we married yet because the
00:56:46.799 guy's like oh the window is still open
00:56:48.319 and so
00:56:49.280 they're still completely committed so
00:56:50.720 once the guy does sign off she's like
00:56:52.319 why didn't you do this five years ago
00:56:53.920 well there's some of that and also it
00:56:56.000 feels like everybody kind of settled
00:56:58.480 right like if it was if it was i'm so
00:57:00.079 committed to this i want to get married
00:57:01.280 right now
00:57:01.760 maybe they just did mushrooms together
00:57:03.040 and realize they really love each other
00:57:05.200 again different world man
00:57:09.119 you know y'all i have a different
00:57:10.480 experience from everybody else i dated
00:57:11.680 my wife for for
00:57:12.640 three months we got engaged we were
00:57:14.640 married within 10 months we married for
00:57:16.640 12 years we're both versions when we're
00:57:17.920 married so we're old school
00:57:19.119 it clearly works for you i've tried to
00:57:21.040 be open-minded with basically every kind
00:57:22.960 of way that people live their lives
00:57:24.640 including like couples that live with
00:57:27.440 other couples and they wife swap
00:57:29.440 which is i feel like that's complicated
00:57:32.640 i mean i'll be honest it's complicated i
00:57:34.480 always think those people are trying to
00:57:36.319 i i know people that do that and i
00:57:39.599 almost universally believe that they are
00:57:42.640 distracting themselves from their life
00:57:45.119 they distract themselves from either
00:57:46.640 their career they're fulfilling the
00:57:48.480 potential
00:57:49.119 whether it's as an artist or as a
00:57:51.440 creative person
00:57:52.559 or as a person who's pursuing a
00:57:54.319 discipline i really believe that a lot
00:57:56.720 of times when people
00:57:57.839 complicate their lives with multiple sex
00:57:59.760 partners and a lot of times what they're
00:58:01.760 doing is they're doing it
00:58:03.599 they're distracting themselves and they
00:58:05.520 don't realize it at the time
00:58:06.960 that just keeps getting pulled into this
00:58:08.799 direction pulled in that direction
00:58:10.240 it's because you don't have a primary
00:58:11.839 focus on something that's very important
00:58:13.599 to you
00:58:14.160 yes you know and it doesn't mean that
00:58:16.000 you have to be with this person for the
00:58:17.040 rest of your life
00:58:17.920 it doesn't mean you have to only be with
00:58:19.440 one person but when i see a guy
00:58:21.200 that is you know involved in swinging or
00:58:24.240 something like that and
00:58:25.040 then they're balancing a bunch of
00:58:26.240 different gals trust me
00:58:28.079 that you that you're going to waste time
00:58:30.240 man you know there's not enough time in
00:58:31.680 this life i mean
00:58:32.640 it's weird to tie this whole
00:58:33.440 conversation together but it is true
00:58:34.799 that if you want to be good at a thing
00:58:36.000 or be successful at a thing you have to
00:58:37.119 commit to the thing yes and so that's
00:58:39.359 true whether you're talking marriage
00:58:40.400 it's true whether you're talking
00:58:41.200 educational success whether you're
00:58:42.319 talking career and people
00:58:43.680 you know making bad decisions because
00:58:45.920 distractions are distractions
00:58:47.280 distractions and distractions with every
00:58:49.119 discipline and i think relationships are
00:58:50.880 a discipline
00:58:51.520 in a lot of ways i totally agree yeah i
00:58:53.440 mean and it is true that
00:58:55.359 you know you have to make the the
00:58:58.079 pre-investment and you have to you have
00:58:59.520 to make the commitment that you're going
00:59:00.559 to continue to invest in the
00:59:01.599 relationship as
00:59:02.720 time goes on yeah and then that's where
00:59:04.559 people fall off the wagon it's why i see
00:59:05.599 a lot of divorces around year three
00:59:07.200 right as that passionate love kind of
00:59:09.680 goes down and the companion and love is
00:59:11.440 the name of the term when the companion
00:59:12.880 love starts to rise
00:59:14.000 people are like well yeah but the
00:59:14.960 companion loving is much fun is the
00:59:16.160 passion to love
00:59:17.359 like of course not of course that's just
00:59:20.240 the way it works well that's nature's
00:59:21.520 biological trick
00:59:22.640 the ultimate biological trick is like
00:59:24.559 look when we were monkeys
00:59:26.559 hiding from eagles okay you had to [ __ ]
00:59:29.040 as much as you could and
00:59:30.319 and spread that seed around because you
00:59:32.000 likely only had five or six years on
00:59:33.680 this earth
00:59:34.400 right and you're dead at age 32. yeah
00:59:36.240 you were trying to just get as much of
00:59:37.760 your dna out there as you possibly could
00:59:40.160 that's still inside of us that program
00:59:42.160 is still inside of us
00:59:43.280 and that program is when you see a man
00:59:45.680 and he's with a beautiful woman but
00:59:46.960 another beautiful woman walks by he's
00:59:48.559 like looking at her and thinking maybe
00:59:50.880 maybe i can do better that's a thing
00:59:52.880 that is programmed into your dna
00:59:55.040 but you have to understand what that is
00:59:57.040 if you're a man and you understand what
00:59:58.400 that is
00:59:59.040 you go oh this is nature and it's dirty

01:01:09.280 the pizza guy you show up and
01:01:10.720 two girls are having a pillow fight yeah
01:01:12.319 exactly it's your it's your lizard brain
01:01:14.319 versus your prefrontal cortex exactly
01:01:16.160 yeah it's your monkey brain it's that
01:01:18.480 that monkey that wants to hide from the
01:01:19.920 eagle
01:01:20.559 that's what it is it's like it's like
01:01:22.160 huh i could just do this real quick and
01:01:23.760 across the board you're gonna you're
01:01:24.799 gonna have a
01:01:25.359 a better life it may not be a hotter
01:01:26.640 life but you're gonna have a better life
01:01:27.599 if you use the prefrontal cortex a
01:01:28.880 little more often
01:01:30.000 yes unless you're hugh hefner i don't
01:01:32.079 know if he he had a good life or not
01:01:34.160 he seemed i know some people who worked
01:01:35.839 with him near the end yeah you seem kind
01:01:37.280 of miserable
01:01:38.079 i mean towards the end i'm sure he's
01:01:39.680 miserable he's an 80 year old guy
01:01:41.119 hanging out with 20 year olds
01:01:42.640 what the [ __ ] do you have to say to
01:01:44.400 these people right it's like you were
01:01:46.079 talking about with o.j simpson o.j
01:01:47.599 simpson
01:01:48.480 had a mostly peaceful mostly peaceful
01:01:51.119 day
01:01:51.760 well his life is mostly annoying the
01:01:54.480 time that he gets to [ __ ] them
01:01:56.160 when you're 80 years old you only get to
01:01:58.640 [ __ ] those 24 year olds for like
01:02:00.720 how long can he last once every six
01:02:02.640 weeks what do you think well he's on
01:02:04.079 probably all kinds of drugs that keep
01:02:05.839 his dick hard but i would imagine
01:02:07.440 like he couldn't run on a treadmill for
01:02:10.000 20 minutes
01:02:10.720 right right at that age so how is he
01:02:12.880 gonna have sex for 20 minutes
01:02:14.480 so if he even if he's having sex like
01:02:16.400 it's probably exhausting
01:02:18.480 and the rest of the day he's just
01:02:20.960 listening to them talk about tick-tock
01:02:22.960 and all kinds of other stupid [ __ ] he's
01:02:24.640 like
01:02:24.880 he's like remember when frank sinatra
01:02:26.079 was here and we were banging everything
01:02:27.200 inside and he's like those were the good
01:02:28.559 old days
01:02:29.440 i was wearing a robe i had a pipe we
01:02:32.079 were having fun on a tv show
01:02:34.240 i had my own channel he had a playboy
01:02:36.079 channel for a while
01:02:37.280 yeah i think it's the image
01:02:40.319 of it is way more interesting than the
01:02:43.520 actual
01:02:44.000 act of living that life yep and i think
01:02:46.559 that again
01:02:47.359 that that goes back to you know every
01:02:49.760 bad decision people make is is tied into
01:02:51.520 this is the the image of things looks
01:02:53.200 way better than the actuality of things
01:02:54.799 it's true in politics it's true in love
01:02:56.559 it's true it's drawn a lot of things
01:02:58.240 yeah
01:02:58.640 and so you actually have to look at the
01:02:59.599 actuality of things and you don't want
01:03:01.520 to be an 80 year old guy i live with
01:03:02.960 five
01:03:03.280 24 year old girls you just don't
01:03:07.599 that guy lived in hell i guarantee you i
01:03:09.920 bet his life was mostly annoying but
01:03:11.680 every now and then while he's having sex
01:03:13.039 with those 24 year olds he's probably
01:03:14.240 like i can't believe this is real
01:03:16.559 for that 30 seconds yeah i can't believe
01:03:18.240 this perfect body and i
01:03:19.920 get to like with this wrinkly sack of
01:03:22.319 rocks
01:03:22.960 that he has as a body he gets to have
01:03:25.440 sex with this
01:03:26.880 beautiful perfect specimen of a of a
01:03:29.039 female human being
01:03:30.160 and then she's like buy me stuff and
01:03:31.359 he's like god this is all he has to do
01:03:33.280 you make me famous yeah yeah worked out
01:03:35.920 great
01:03:36.799 well you know the grotto the by the end
01:03:39.440 it seemed like it was pretty dingy
01:03:40.640 dude i went there i i really did a
01:03:42.880 marijuana policy
01:03:44.000 project uh thing there once and uh
01:03:47.280 of course sounds like a lot of policy it
01:03:49.039 sounds like a lot of policy
01:03:50.559 but one of the things he did was like we
01:03:52.240 were wandering around it's like an aei
01:03:54.000 summit you know it's like
01:03:54.720 when i go to heritage foundation it's
01:03:56.000 what it sounds like right there
01:03:58.079 it was it was a fun night well i would i
01:04:00.720 remember
01:04:01.520 you know it was there was a lot of
01:04:02.960 marijuana smoked it was
01:04:04.799 quite a blurry evening but i remember
01:04:07.039 thinking like my god this grotto is so
01:04:09.039 outdated
01:04:10.000 like it had like a [ __ ] old ass phone
01:04:12.559 there and
01:04:13.200 like i'm like how much how many people
01:04:15.359 [ __ ] in here like how weird is there
01:04:16.799 just generations of
01:04:18.559 human residue in here yeah yeah and
01:04:20.799 maybe not like the best times either you
01:04:22.960 know
01:04:23.280 it's like a lot of it it's it's just
01:04:25.280 it's what you think it is versus what it
01:04:27.680 is
01:04:28.160 you know yep well you know it's all
01:04:30.079 working out of life
01:04:31.200 it is let's work on on thinking about
01:04:34.000 what things are rather than what we
01:04:35.280 would like them to be because
01:04:36.880 accepting reality is a hard one
01:04:38.559 accepting reality is a real tough one
01:04:40.079 yeah that's a problem it's a problem
01:04:41.920 with advertising too right because
01:04:43.359 advertising
01:04:44.160 shows you and social media yeah right
01:04:46.799 social media is well that's another
01:04:48.480 jonathan height book the coddling of the
01:04:49.839 american mind which is amazing
01:04:51.599 and it is really illuminates and um i'm
01:04:54.799 waiting for my kids to read it i think
01:04:56.400 maybe this year is a good
01:04:57.680 time for my 12 year old just to
01:04:59.520 understand that this is
01:05:00.880 this is a real issue with children that
01:05:03.760 are
01:05:04.079 comparing their lives to these fa oh
01:05:06.400 here's a here's an example
01:05:07.520 i wanted to show you something i haven't
01:05:09.039 actually put this up anywhere
01:05:11.200 but this is actually important because
01:05:13.839 this is so
01:05:14.720 goddamn crazy i want to show you
01:05:16.480 something
01:05:17.839 um this is something that uh
01:05:21.280 my daughter did uh
01:05:24.319 this is my daughter is ten
01:05:27.359 okay that's her
01:05:31.839 look at that oh my god that's not a
01:05:33.760 ten-year-old you're right
01:05:35.200 it's not 10. it's like a 20 year old
01:05:36.480 right there exactly how's that possible
01:05:39.119 how's that my 10 year old daughter oh
01:05:40.559 she would watch a youtube makeup
01:05:41.680 tutorial or something
01:05:42.480 she used a [ __ ] app she used an app
01:05:45.359 that turned
01:05:46.319 her into it turned her into a woman
01:05:50.880 like what the [ __ ] is that so like when
01:05:52.880 you're you're seeing things like that
01:05:54.480 what is that how are they doing that and
01:05:56.720 who's doing that so
01:05:57.839 if you're a girl and you are overweight
01:06:01.760 or you have you don't like the structure
01:06:03.359 of your face
01:06:04.400 or you know whatever is bothering you
01:06:06.960 you have acne
01:06:08.319 and you see a girl like that and she's
01:06:11.200 she's like
01:06:12.079 can't believe i'm graduating high school
01:06:14.160 lol what do i do now
01:06:16.160 and you see this that's not even her
01:06:19.200 right this is my 10 year old she doesn't
01:06:21.200 look anything like that
01:06:22.799 like she showed she's like daddy look
01:06:24.559 this is what i look like i go that is
01:06:26.000 not what you look like
01:06:27.359 i mean what the [ __ ] you just did that's
01:06:29.599 not what you look like
01:06:30.640 and so i had her go through this with me
01:06:33.039 and show me what she did
01:06:34.480 i'm like show me how you did this like
01:06:35.760 what are you doing she's using some
01:06:37.599 weird app like
01:06:38.960 like was it khloe kardashian the one who
01:06:41.280 changed her whole head
01:06:42.240 yeah yeah yeah that like you know this
01:06:44.960 it's such a recipe for failure
01:06:46.480 it really is it's such a recipe for
01:06:48.000 failure because you're always going to
01:06:48.799 fall short of that
01:06:50.000 and it's one thing to shoot for better
01:06:51.599 it's another thing to shoot for the
01:06:53.119 unobtainable and then be
01:06:54.400 upset when you can never reach the
01:06:55.680 unattainable but it's sick
01:06:57.520 it's it's sick because you're these
01:06:59.920 people don't even
01:07:01.200 look like that and then you look at that
01:07:04.319 and you go
01:07:04.960 why don't i look like that like they
01:07:07.039 don't even look like that
01:07:08.559 right the amount of people that actually
01:07:10.559 look like that that
01:07:11.839 that image that i just showed you is so
01:07:14.480 small
01:07:15.200 and it's so unattainable and then it has
01:07:17.039 broader societal ramifications because
01:07:18.720 then it turns into
01:07:20.160 stories about well okay well society
01:07:22.079 doesn't accept me for the way that i am
01:07:23.440 society values that look and that means
01:07:24.960 society is flawed and it's like well how
01:07:26.559 about this how about like
01:07:27.760 people are flawed society's flawed
01:07:29.599 you're flawed do the best you can
01:07:31.119 everything is flawed everything is
01:07:32.319 flawed but that's not even really what
01:07:33.920 the problem is
01:07:34.960 what the problem is we've created a
01:07:36.720 technology that we're not
01:07:38.720 equipped to manage we're not equipped to
01:07:41.520 navigate
01:07:42.160 social media we didn't grow up with it
01:07:44.319 we didn't evolve with it
01:07:45.599 this is something it's involving us now
01:07:46.960 no it's true it's 100 i mean they've
01:07:48.559 built these apps that are specifically
01:07:49.839 designed to be addictive right i mean
01:07:51.119 they're specifically designed to prey on
01:07:52.559 certain parts of your brain that are
01:07:53.839 you're not really in control of that are
01:07:55.359 mostly subconscious
01:07:56.960 and that is scary stuff for sure i mean
01:07:58.480 you can be manipulated by by that stuff
01:08:00.640 it's you can make people very very
01:08:02.480 easily very easily
01:08:04.240 my kids my kids aren't getting like i
01:08:06.079 seriously will not give them a
01:08:07.359 smartphone until they're probably
01:08:09.200 mid-teens late teens will they get a gun
01:08:10.960 first probably
01:08:13.119 probably yeah
01:08:14.360 [Laughter]
01:08:18.479 i feel like it's better logic i mean i'd
01:08:19.600 rather that my 13 year old know how to
01:08:20.880 shoot than my 13 year old how to browse
01:08:22.238 porn
01:08:23.120 yes i think that is good logic you know
01:08:25.120 what's it really that's a real issue
01:08:26.880 with boys
01:08:27.759 uh boys that have access instantaneously
01:08:30.000 i mean if you give a
01:08:31.040 phone you're basically saying here
01:08:32.560 little fella go watch people [ __ ]
01:08:34.880 they're gonna that's the first thing
01:08:36.080 they're gonna do when you're not around
01:08:37.279 and there are all sorts of studies that
01:08:38.399 demonstrate that this leads to
01:08:39.839 relationship and sexual insufficiency
01:08:41.839 later and it ain't good it ain't good i
01:08:44.158 mean this is not an argument to ban porn
01:08:45.600 or anything but like
01:08:46.640 the way that it has integrated into so
01:08:48.560 many really young people's lives i'm
01:08:50.399 talking like young teens
01:08:51.679 right what percentage of american males
01:08:53.279 do you think are addicted to porn at
01:08:54.158 this point it's a giant
01:08:55.198 it's got to be 50 right i mean it's got
01:08:57.359 to be extraordinarily high percentage
01:08:59.040 and none of that is good for
01:09:00.238 relations between men and women and then
01:09:02.080 you got this weird dynamic where
01:09:03.759 it used to be that the feminist movement
01:09:05.279 sort of recognized what social
01:09:06.399 conservatives did that this is pretty
01:09:07.520 objectifying and
01:09:08.560 not necessarily great for women now and
01:09:10.238 then it's like now in sex workers which
01:09:12.479 is weird
01:09:13.120 it is weird they went completely the
01:09:14.640 other direction and i just thought in
01:09:16.399 what
01:09:17.040 what hugh hefner fantasy did women
01:09:18.960 decide that all the women at hugh
01:09:20.000 hefner's mansion were actually
01:09:21.679 super duper empowered like that does not
01:09:23.920 seem like the most super empowering
01:09:25.198 lifestyle
01:09:26.000 like you make your choices man it's a
01:09:27.198 free country but my wife's a doctor
01:09:29.279 and i feel like that's more empowering
01:09:30.560 than like getting screwed by an 80 year
01:09:32.319 old for for
01:09:33.279 you know pocket change depends on what
01:09:34.719 kind of car he buys her
01:09:36.960 mom is a doctor she can get whatever car
01:09:38.319 she damn well pleases my friend what
01:09:40.000 happened
01:09:40.880 what happened that that became like
01:09:43.679 empowerment like
01:09:44.719 how did what where was this i think
01:09:46.479 there was a shift and it's a shift
01:09:47.679 that's happened throughout american
01:09:48.799 society
01:09:49.520 that went from the notion
01:09:52.799 that men were acting like pigs and they
01:09:55.199 should stop acting like pigs
01:09:56.719 to what if everybody acted like pigs and
01:09:59.040 so instead of just
01:10:00.080 saying that standards exist and people
01:10:01.520 don't live up to them but the standards
01:10:02.719 are actually not a bad thing
01:10:03.760 we just decided you know what we don't
01:10:04.800 want to be hypocrites we're getting rid
01:10:05.679 of all standards whatsoever
01:10:07.440 everybody shouldn't have standards and
01:10:08.719 if you believe that anybody should have
01:10:10.320 standards then you're a hypocrite and
01:10:11.520 when all the standards go then
01:10:12.719 everything goes
01:10:13.920 so like i actually kind of agree with
01:10:15.840 the original feminist idea that
01:10:17.440 men were kind of acting like sexist
01:10:18.640 jackasses and they should stop that but
01:10:20.400 the solution to that was not
01:10:21.760 okay now women should imitate men at
01:10:24.320 their worst and that's a free or better
01:10:25.679 society like i just don't think that
01:10:26.880 that's
01:10:27.520 against free country do what you want on
01:10:29.040 the legislative level but as a cultural
01:10:30.640 matter i don't think that leads to a lot
01:10:31.679 of human happiness
01:10:32.640 i look at it like sexual televangelists
01:10:36.719 that's what i look at like pornography
01:10:38.480 like i think that
01:10:40.719 you should be allowed to rip people
01:10:44.080 off with a really obvious ruse
01:10:48.400 like if you're one of those late-night
01:10:49.920 people that can put hands on people
01:10:52.239 and raise them from the dead if you're
01:10:53.920 one of those people i feel like god
01:10:55.520 that's so obvious
01:10:56.719 it's almost like a good little pitfall
01:10:58.320 to have out there in society to teach
01:10:59.920 people that some folks can be deceptive
01:11:02.080 and i feel like really manipulative
01:11:04.640 women
01:11:05.120 that trick old guys into marrying them
01:11:07.040 and then take all their money i feel
01:11:08.400 like that's
01:11:09.040 that's yeah that's deserved at a certain
01:11:12.480 point you're like
01:11:13.040 okay i sign off on this come on stupid
01:11:14.719 yeah you didn't see this coming
01:11:16.080 it's like this is a great country i mean
01:11:18.080 it really is like you can make money
01:11:19.280 doing pretty much anything like when
01:11:20.320 people say it's hard to make money in
01:11:21.360 this country
01:11:22.640 there are a lot of people making money a
01:11:24.159 lot of different ways yes in this
01:11:26.159 country and i mean
01:11:27.520 for god's sake colin kaepernick is
01:11:28.719 making millions of dollars kneeling for
01:11:30.080 the national anthem it feels like and
01:11:31.360 calling america racist while cashing the
01:11:32.719 check this is a great damned country
01:11:34.719 well we're now we're getting into the
01:11:36.480 weeds
01:11:38.080 i just wanted to talk about girls
01:11:39.199 ripping dudes off i know you did but we
01:11:40.960 can go back there man
01:11:41.840 that's okay but the colin kaepernick
01:11:44.560 thing
01:11:45.280 all right don't you think that
01:11:49.120 at least some good has come out of
01:11:52.400 him doing that where it sort of
01:11:56.080 raised awareness for police brutality
01:11:59.120 just let it just put it to the forefront
01:12:01.040 let people
01:12:02.159 like let people understand that this is
01:12:04.000 a problem
01:12:05.679 no no no because i think that he made
01:12:09.440 a serious error which is that the most
01:12:11.920 positive movements in american social
01:12:13.440 history
01:12:14.000 have been ones that don't kneel for the
01:12:15.360 flag but say in the name of the flag you
01:12:17.040 should do x
01:12:18.080 right so martin luther king said in the
01:12:20.000 name of the flag civil rights are
01:12:21.600 necessary
01:12:22.560 booker t washington said the name of the
01:12:24.000 flag civil rights are necessary they
01:12:25.600 didn't say the american flag stands for
01:12:27.360 racism and jim crowley so the american
01:12:28.880 flag stands for something beyond that
01:12:30.560 live up to the american flag but here's
01:12:32.239 here's mine trashing the american flag
01:12:33.679 is like endemic of police brutality is
01:12:35.199 first of all it's [ __ ]
01:12:36.000 but second of all it's actually divisive
01:12:38.000 on an issue that does not need to be
01:12:39.440 divisive like nobody is in favor of
01:12:40.880 police brutality nor should anyone be
01:12:42.719 right here's the counterpoint why is it
01:12:44.719 trashing the american flag to take a
01:12:46.560 knee
01:12:47.679 isn't that in in some ways just another
01:12:50.960 gesture of respect like you're not
01:12:54.159 doing what everybody wants you to do
01:12:56.080 which is put your hand over your heart
01:12:58.320 but you're doing something that's also
01:13:00.640 respectful
01:13:01.760 and silent you're not standing up and
01:13:03.920 going [ __ ] the american flag
01:13:06.080 [ __ ] these people you're actually taking
01:13:08.239 it to another level of respect you're
01:13:09.920 taking a knee you're bending the knee
01:13:12.480 whether you're doing it for something
01:13:15.440 that you want to talk about later saying
01:13:17.120 i'm not going to stand up because this
01:13:18.640 is my way
01:13:19.760 of acknowledging the fact that there
01:13:21.920 have been
01:13:23.280 a lot of people that have been
01:13:24.640 mistreated by police and murdered by
01:13:26.640 police and this is how i do it this is
01:13:28.320 how i treat
01:13:29.760 racist police killing black people i i
01:13:32.719 take that moment to take a knee
01:13:34.560 like how is that so disrespectful like
01:13:36.880 how is that
01:13:38.320 any it's a just a silent gesture it's
01:13:41.199 not
01:13:41.520 uniform like it's not doing this thing
01:13:43.920 that everybody else is doing
01:13:45.360 but you're doing something that's very
01:13:47.040 respectful you're taking a knee
01:13:48.800 um well that's certainly not the way
01:13:50.480 that he intended when he first started
01:13:51.920 that way i mean if you want to interpret
01:13:53.280 that way you can
01:13:54.159 how do you know what his intention is
01:13:55.440 because he literally talked about it i
01:13:56.640 mean he said that he
01:13:57.520 wanted to highlight that right he said
01:13:59.760 but he said america
01:14:00.719 is a systemically racist country he
01:14:02.320 worked socks with pictures of cops as
01:14:04.239 pigs on them
01:14:05.920 oh yeah i don't know oh yeah i mean
01:14:07.840 colin kaepernick is a terrible
01:14:08.800 spokesperson for this moment
01:14:10.320 like again like these are there's so
01:14:12.159 many people that have
01:14:13.679 taken a knee and don't you think that
01:14:15.760 but if you just look at the gesture
01:14:17.199 itself
01:14:17.760 isn't taking a knee even more respectful
01:14:20.800 than standing with your hand over your
01:14:22.159 heart i mean
01:14:23.840 then i imagine millions of us would
01:14:26.000 routinely take a need for the american
01:14:27.280 flag i mean the idea
01:14:28.320 wouldn't if that was the thing you had
01:14:29.679 to do if the id but again this guy
01:14:32.239 decided to stand and put his hand over
01:14:33.760 his heart
01:14:34.880 really it's just it's sort of a
01:14:36.080 traditional thing we're arguing over
01:14:38.080 well
01:14:38.880 i mean it isn't the way that it was
01:14:40.000 originally expressed it sort of morphed
01:14:42.080 over time right to the point where it
01:14:43.440 doesn't necessarily mean what he
01:14:44.239 originally meant it's not like he's
01:14:45.679 going
01:14:46.239 [ __ ] you while everybody else has their
01:14:48.000 hand over their heart in silence but
01:14:49.600 he's taking a knee he he didn't mean it
01:14:51.440 as an fu i mean there's no question
01:14:53.040 that's what he meant it is
01:14:54.000 he and it wasn't even over something
01:14:55.520 that actually made sense like you
01:14:56.719 understand during the civil rights
01:14:57.840 movement
01:14:58.320 when people are raising the black power
01:15:00.320 fest at the olympics to say
01:15:01.600 like we're fighting for civil rights jim
01:15:03.120 crow is still in operation around the
01:15:04.480 country
01:15:04.880 right colin kaepernick taking the needs
01:15:06.719 to symbolize that america's police are
01:15:08.159 systemically brutal and racist
01:15:10.320 is just it's factually untrue and to
01:15:12.880 attribute that to the american flag is
01:15:14.320 really kind of nasty but he's not a
01:15:15.840 statistician right so he's looking at
01:15:18.239 things like the eric gardner case or
01:15:20.560 you know which is a terrible one right
01:15:23.520 there's there's
01:15:24.239 cases that you see like when the guy's
01:15:26.000 just selling loose cigarettes and
01:15:27.199 they're struggling
01:15:28.000 from the store it's a terrible case you
01:15:29.840 see something like that and that
01:15:31.440 motivates him to do that
01:15:33.040 and i know what you're saying that these
01:15:34.320 are anecdotes and this doesn't
01:15:36.400 encompass the full statistics of cops
01:15:39.840 versus black men and how it what what is
01:15:43.280 exactly is happening but that's not his
01:15:45.840 area of expertise anyway he has
01:15:47.760 he has that so making him a spokesperson
01:15:50.239 for a movement where he has no expertise
01:15:51.520 is a weird thing to do
01:15:52.560 there are plenty of people who talk
01:15:53.440 about this with actual statistical right
01:15:55.520 but if you're knowledgeable
01:15:56.400 a famous person and you you decide to
01:15:58.640 take this big stand publicly like that
01:16:00.560 after you get benched for blaine gabbard
01:16:01.920 yeah i have to get bench for blaine
01:16:03.360 gabbert and take millions of bucks from
01:16:04.480 a major corporation
01:16:06.239 is that the guy yeah the immortal blaine
01:16:09.040 gabbert the hall of famer blaine gabbert
01:16:10.400 who played like no no
01:16:11.920 no blaine gabbert was an nfl quarterback
01:16:14.560 who sucked i mean he was terrible and
01:16:15.840 they they benched colin kaepernick for
01:16:17.199 him and it was after he got benched that
01:16:18.239 he started doing the kneeling for like
01:16:19.199 for the american flag i am a pretty good
01:16:20.960 gig
01:16:21.360 sports broadcaster who knows nothing
01:16:23.199 about sports
01:16:24.640 listen people try to talk to me about it
01:16:27.840 if you explain it the way that you're
01:16:28.960 explaining it meaning we're not living
01:16:30.640 up to the american flag which is why i'm
01:16:31.760 kneeling
01:16:32.800 i wouldn't be arguing with it he didn't
01:16:34.480 explain it that way that wasn't that
01:16:35.679 wasn't the way it went down
01:16:36.719 but it's just him what do you think
01:16:38.239 about god there's certain guys that like
01:16:40.320 lock arms during the american fight i
01:16:42.400 never promised that okay locking arms
01:16:44.000 okay but kneeling is bad
01:16:45.199 well no well the way that he
01:16:46.159 characterizes kneeling was bad okay
01:16:47.679 meaning like
01:16:48.320 but what about other people that neil if
01:16:49.840 they characterize it differently it
01:16:50.800 means a different thing okay
01:16:51.840 right i mean meaning like what it
01:16:53.840 originally was is what it was
01:16:55.199 i'm not gonna retcon what he meant at
01:16:56.800 the time he was the first to do it right
01:16:58.560 right and then he and then he made
01:16:59.920 millions of dollars for his bravery
01:17:01.679 again
01:17:02.080 i don't think it takes a whole hell of a
01:17:03.199 lot of bravery to be benched for blaine
01:17:04.480 gabbert take a knee
01:17:05.840 make millions of bucks from nike i wish
01:17:07.600 i could play explain gabbard
01:17:08.880 fellows terrible qb rating is all you
01:17:11.360 really need to know
01:17:12.159 not a good quarterback is the answer so
01:17:13.760 is colin kaepernick i mean i don't
01:17:15.760 as a an athlete is he not good
01:17:18.960 like he's a terrific athlete he's just
01:17:20.239 not a very good quarterback okay so i
01:17:21.920 mean he he had one fantastic season he
01:17:23.760 led the the 49ers to the super bowl and
01:17:25.520 then like a lot of kind of
01:17:26.800 one-hit wonders in sports people kind of
01:17:28.640 figured him out season two and his qb
01:17:30.239 rating started to decline
01:17:31.600 but i mean look bottom line is that the
01:17:35.199 making him the spokesperson of a
01:17:36.480 movement where he really
01:17:38.880 i don't like the idea that you are going
01:17:40.640 to attribute to all of america
01:17:42.880 a sin that is number one anecdotal in
01:17:45.199 nature
01:17:45.920 and number two cannot be attributed to
01:17:47.840 america's highest ideals you're doing it
01:17:49.360 wrong if you want to fight police
01:17:50.640 brutality
01:17:51.440 say america is not living up to her
01:17:52.960 promises say that
01:17:54.560 the promise of america like there is a
01:17:56.640 way to conv
01:17:57.600 every successful social movement in
01:17:59.040 american history has done this the gay
01:18:00.320 rights movement did this the gay rights
01:18:01.360 movement said listen
01:18:02.239 everybody in america has been guaranteed
01:18:03.679 a certain level of freedom and we're not
01:18:05.120 being guaranteed that level of freedom
01:18:06.719 right the freedom to pursue happiness is
01:18:09.040 not being guaranteed to us we're just
01:18:10.480 asking that we'd be left alone leave us
01:18:12.000 alone
01:18:12.560 and it took time but most americans came
01:18:14.000 around to that perspective the the same
01:18:16.000 thing holds true
01:18:16.880 on race the same thing holds strong
01:18:18.080 police brutality if you make an
01:18:19.600 invocation and you say to americans as
01:18:21.520 americans
01:18:22.640 i know that over time my fellow
01:18:23.920 americans are going to come to realize
01:18:25.679 that they need to live in accordance
01:18:27.120 with the fundamental principles that
01:18:28.320 founded the country
01:18:29.440 that's unifying to say that the american
01:18:31.120 flag is inherently non-unifying
01:18:33.360 is is really bad like to the point where
01:18:35.840 you now have college campuses where if
01:18:37.120 you fly an american flag
01:18:38.159 there have been cases where people are
01:18:39.280 asked to take it down because it's too
01:18:40.159 divisive like that
01:18:41.440 that's that's that that does seem crazy
01:18:43.679 when you say
01:18:45.040 it's anecdotal that you know you know
01:18:47.280 he's reacting to something that's
01:18:48.480 anecdotal but there's
01:18:49.520 many of those anecdotes and you see them
01:18:51.440 over and over again the problem is
01:18:53.600 they're so they're they're so prevalent
01:18:56.480 there's so many videos
01:18:57.520 so this is my friend joe schilling is a
01:18:59.679 kickboxer and his
01:19:01.040 entire instagram has been dedicated to
01:19:02.800 bad cops over the last few months
01:19:04.800 just showing all these videos of bad
01:19:07.120 cops i mean
01:19:08.880 yes it's anecdotal but god damn there's
01:19:11.040 a lot of anecdotes well there's 330
01:19:12.640 million police interactions every year
01:19:14.000 so
01:19:14.239 yeah i mean that's what was the initial
01:19:17.360 interaction that what was his motivation
01:19:20.239 to do that was there an
01:19:21.280 uh a single instance of police brutality
01:19:23.840 that caused him to do that trying to
01:19:24.960 remember which season he did this this
01:19:26.239 would have been
01:19:26.960 three four years ago so i'm trying to
01:19:28.960 remember i don't think it was the
01:19:30.400 michael brown situation because i
01:19:31.600 remember there were protests in the nfl
01:19:32.719 over michael brown
01:19:33.760 right which was actually a bad anecdote
01:19:35.120 like that was a bad one for people to
01:19:36.159 pick people doing the hands up don't
01:19:37.280 shoot that didn't actually happen right
01:19:38.560 he actually tried to grab the gun from
01:19:40.080 the cop he the gun went off in the car
01:19:41.760 he charged the cop
01:19:42.719 by witness testimony all the witnesses
01:19:44.320 were black you know the eric gardner one
01:19:46.400 is much cleaner right well
01:19:47.760 the eric garner one is cleaner in terms
01:19:49.120 of police brutality it's not super clean
01:19:50.719 in terms of racism or even cause of
01:19:52.480 death
01:19:53.120 so this is one of the problems police
01:19:54.960 brutality police brutality for sure it's
01:19:56.560 kind of like
01:19:57.120 it's actually you know i'm warning
01:19:58.480 people now that what happens in the
01:20:00.560 george floyd case with derek calvin
01:20:02.960 like they should be warned up front i
01:20:04.400 want this police officer punished i
01:20:05.920 think everyone wants the police officer
01:20:07.199 punished
01:20:08.000 the defense is going to make a case that
01:20:10.800 the police officer is not responsible
01:20:12.639 for
01:20:13.040 george floyd's death in exactly the same
01:20:14.639 way that the new york police officers
01:20:15.920 made the case that they were not
01:20:16.719 responsible for eric garner's death
01:20:18.400 and the autopsy the the initial autopsy
01:20:21.040 tends to support that so
01:20:22.560 what that suggests is not that derek
01:20:24.639 calvin is good or clean or decent
01:20:26.800 but if you're going to charge him with
01:20:27.760 murder that's that's a hard charge to
01:20:29.360 make just on a legal level
01:20:30.719 so i'm warning people now of that
01:20:31.840 because the the move the next move will
01:20:34.080 be
01:20:34.719 obviously the system is racist if derek
01:20:36.239 shaven doesn't get convicted of
01:20:37.360 first-degree murder
01:20:38.560 it's going to be very hard to convict
01:20:39.760 him i think you're charging him with
01:20:40.639 second it's going to be very difficult
01:20:41.920 to convince him
01:20:42.719 to charge for a second right because at
01:20:44.080 first would mean pre-meditation right
01:20:45.520 third well he was charged with third
01:20:46.719 originally and then keith ellison the ag
01:20:48.159 over there elevated it's a second degree
01:20:49.600 i think that's very difficult to make
01:20:50.880 the case for for second-degree murder
01:20:52.239 what were you pulling up jamie you had
01:20:53.920 something you want to say yeah i had the
01:20:56.880 part of when this
01:20:57.840 actually started in 2016. he started
01:21:00.880 i just keep doing that he started by
01:21:02.880 sitting
01:21:03.920 and people started getting video of him
01:21:05.440 sitting as the preseason was starting
01:21:07.600 so he then talked to a teammate they
01:21:09.360 discussed kneeling was the best thing
01:21:10.960 for him to do at the time
01:21:12.800 um do you remember do you know which
01:21:14.080 incident kind of kicked it off that's
01:21:15.600 why i was gonna play a video of it so i
01:21:17.040 had here the actual first video of him
01:21:18.560 talking about
01:21:19.440 him donating a million dollars to the
01:21:20.880 local community i think he had guns
01:21:22.800 drawn on him
01:21:23.920 which is probably what started okay but
01:21:26.480 here's him talking about that
01:21:29.120 and i've been very blessed to be in this
01:21:32.000 position and be able to make the kind of
01:21:33.600 money i do
01:21:34.800 and i have to help these people
01:21:37.840 i have to help these communities it's
01:21:40.080 not right
01:21:40.880 that they're not put in the position to
01:21:44.000 succeed
01:21:44.639 or given those opportunities to succeed
01:21:47.280 and as far as
01:21:48.800 taking the knee tonight
01:21:52.239 eric as well as myself had a long
01:21:54.320 conversation with nate boyer who
01:21:56.000 is a military vet and
01:21:59.920 we were talking to him about how can we
01:22:02.159 get the message back
01:22:03.360 on track and not take away from
01:22:06.800 the military not take away from fighting
01:22:09.600 our country
01:22:11.120 but keep the focus on what the issues
01:22:14.400 really are
01:22:15.760 and as we talked about it we came up
01:22:18.400 with taking the knee
01:22:20.480 because there are issues that still need
01:22:22.080 to be addressed and
01:22:25.120 it was also a way to try to show more
01:22:27.199 respect to the men and women that fight
01:22:28.719 for this country okay so that's better
01:22:30.159 obviously
01:22:31.199 but that's him scroll down for a second
01:22:33.040 because i think that that's his that's
01:22:34.400 2016. so here's
01:22:36.480 this one okay look at the one right
01:22:37.600 below that okay this is the one i'm
01:22:39.120 talking about
01:22:39.679 i'm not going to stand up to show pride
01:22:41.679 in a flag for a country that oppresses
01:22:43.520 black people
01:22:44.560 and people of color that's the sentence
01:22:46.159 right there so that's a different
01:22:47.760 that the video was four or five days
01:22:50.960 after these statements were made so he
01:22:52.239 said he changed
01:22:52.960 after talking to someone he made okay
01:22:55.600 right so the initial explanation is the
01:22:57.040 one that i was talking about okay so he
01:22:58.960 revised his feelings on it and then well
01:23:02.320 that's nothing much
01:23:04.159 it started with kaepernick had guns
01:23:06.239 drawn on him by cops for being one of
01:23:07.840 the only black guys in his town
01:23:09.760 yeah that seemed super reasonable what
01:23:11.760 he said there about how
01:23:13.199 having the second take after talking
01:23:14.320 about the military yeah that's better
01:23:16.080 military rather yeah although he
01:23:17.600 recently released a video that sort of
01:23:19.280 goes back to the original explanation
01:23:20.560 suggesting that america
01:23:21.840 is endemically and systemically racist
01:23:23.600 which is which is a problem that's a hot
01:23:25.040 take right now it's good
01:23:26.639 it's very popular yeah that's that's the
01:23:28.560 big one yeah that's the big one
01:23:29.840 yeah how do you think we get back on
01:23:32.719 track
01:23:33.360 how does how do we find balance i always
01:23:35.840 hope that things go
01:23:37.679 really far in one direction and then
01:23:39.600 really far in the other direction and
01:23:41.040 sort of
01:23:42.080 listen i end up in the same place i
01:23:44.560 always end up which is we gotta learn to
01:23:46.400 leave each other the f
01:23:47.600 alone i mean seriously like that's
01:23:49.360 that's the only way this is going to
01:23:50.400 work
01:23:50.800 because we either have to decide we want
01:23:51.920 to share a country and live together
01:23:53.040 with each other or
01:23:53.920 we have to decide we don't yeah if we
01:23:55.679 want to live together and share a
01:23:56.639 country
01:23:57.199 then we have to stop basically making
01:24:00.159 crazy demands of one another and this is
01:24:02.239 what the cancel culture is all about but
01:24:03.520 we
01:24:03.760 we got we got to stop that we got to
01:24:05.120 recognize that people may not agree with
01:24:06.880 you people may do things differently
01:24:08.159 than you and that's okay like
01:24:09.280 as much as i just like what colin
01:24:10.719 kaepernick's doing i don't think that
01:24:11.760 you should be blackballed from the nfl
01:24:13.280 if i were an nfl owner by the way i'd
01:24:14.400 hire him in a second you know the kind
01:24:16.000 of press i'd get for hiring colin
01:24:17.199 kaepernick
01:24:17.840 i'd make a boatload off of colin
01:24:19.520 kaepernick that's a great deal
01:24:21.440 so how come people aren't doing it um i
01:24:24.000 mean i assume
01:24:24.880 because he's not that great a
01:24:26.560 quarterback i mean like if he were tom
01:24:28.320 brady i think that he would
01:24:29.600 you know be getting a contract he also i
01:24:32.320 mean there was that whole situation last
01:24:33.600 year with kaepernick where he
01:24:34.800 where he wanted to do tryouts for the
01:24:36.400 nfl and then he sort of broke the nfl's
01:24:37.920 rules and doing the tryouts and he
01:24:39.280 wanted to film it a certain way and all
01:24:40.719 this sort of stuff but
01:24:42.000 i guess i'd backup quarterback because
01:24:44.159 here's the thing you're either going to
01:24:45.040 please
01:24:45.520 one half of the population or please the
01:24:46.800 other either he's amazing in which case
01:24:48.239 you've got a winning team and a great
01:24:49.679 story
01:24:50.320 or he gets sacked every other down in
01:24:51.679 which case half the country cheers so
01:24:53.840 controversy sells yeah that's for sure
01:24:55.679 yeah but how do we
01:24:58.239 i mean this is probably one of the most
01:25:00.159 racially divisive times in my memory
01:25:02.960 in my lifetime i don't remember things
01:25:04.960 being everybody's worried about
01:25:07.440 everything being racist every single
01:25:10.320 thing that anyone does syrup is racist
01:25:13.199 pancakes are racist oh it's it's evolved
01:25:15.280 into all the you saw this trader joe's
01:25:16.960 story
01:25:17.280 you were telling me earlier so trader
01:25:19.199 joe's is called trader joe's
01:25:21.040 right which is not racist i guess but
01:25:22.800 apparently they they
01:25:24.080 have mexican products that they were
01:25:25.440 calling trader jose's
01:25:27.520 and some bored person in their basement
01:25:30.560 decided to create a petition
01:25:32.400 that got signed by some 2400 other board
01:25:34.400 people about why it shouldn't be called
01:25:36.080 trader jose because that's racist
01:25:38.159 so apparently it's cultural
01:25:39.199 appropriation if you're trader joe's and
01:25:40.800 you make a burrito
01:25:41.840 but if you call trader jose's then
01:25:43.520 that's i i think they called it
01:25:45.600 exoticizing
01:25:47.040 mexican people-sizing yeah it's making
01:25:49.040 them exotic and other
01:25:50.560 so trader joe's pulled it down trader
01:25:51.840 joe's gonna is gonna not use this
01:25:53.440 anymore 17 year old called out
01:25:55.280 a 17 year old called out trader joe's
01:25:58.320 now the chain is dropping offensive
01:26:00.400 labeling
01:26:02.719 like how many hispanics were picketing
01:26:04.400 outside trader joe's being uh now that i
01:26:05.679 saw that trader jose beer
01:26:06.960 right listen i'm italian do you think
01:26:08.480 papa gino's is that really
01:26:10.159 you know i mean is that really an
01:26:11.679 italian who made that company like
01:26:13.440 how many how many different like
01:26:16.719 different pizza companies and all these
01:26:19.679 i would love to see italians
01:26:21.120 i'd love to see the racial breakdown of
01:26:22.480 the people who signed this petition i
01:26:23.760 would bet 90
01:26:24.800 of them are white 90 right right white
01:26:27.040 live in the suburbs hate their parents
01:26:29.040 yeah what did you say what was the word
01:26:30.719 they used for it exoticized
01:26:32.320 exoticized they said yeah oh my god that
01:26:34.639 is so adorable
01:26:36.040 exoticizing i was talking to you about
01:26:38.320 um rick bayless who's a famous chef of
01:26:41.280 mexican cuisine
01:26:42.800 who is a white man who who adores
01:26:46.000 mexican food i mean i love the guy i
01:26:48.080 love listening to his videos i love
01:26:49.679 mexican food so
01:26:51.280 watching this guy's videos it's like i
01:26:53.199 love someone who's really into something
01:26:55.199 you know i just i get a kick out of even
01:26:57.040 like there's a guy i used to watch on
01:26:58.320 pbs
01:26:59.120 that would make furniture with um
01:27:02.480 ancient tools i could use like like
01:27:05.280 ancient
01:27:05.920 like um uh different old-timey saws and
01:27:10.639 chisels and [ __ ] and he would make these
01:27:12.880 wooden chairs and tables and furniture
01:27:15.760 right but he kind of looked like that
01:27:18.159 but he was he was really dressed like an
01:27:20.159 old-timey guy
01:27:21.440 and he had this old-timey shop and he
01:27:23.199 would make this stuff and i loved
01:27:24.639 watching him and i don't give a [ __ ]
01:27:26.480 about his shitty furniture i don't but
01:27:28.880 what i cared about was the fact that
01:27:30.719 this guy was really passionate
01:27:32.000 about his thing and it was very
01:27:33.040 attractive to me and i feel the same way
01:27:34.880 and i watched this guy
01:27:36.080 rick bayless talk about mexican cuisine
01:27:38.560 he loves it he takes regular trips to
01:27:40.560 mexico and
01:27:41.679 learns how to cook these dishes in the
01:27:43.360 traditional way and then he talks about
01:27:45.199 it with this great passion
01:27:46.400 but the guy just got [ __ ] all over they
01:27:48.880 were just
01:27:49.520 like you're culturally appropriating you
01:27:51.280 shouldn't be doing this you're a
01:27:52.560 white man let me just say this generally
01:27:54.000 cultural appropriation is a bunch of
01:27:55.199 horseshit and the reason it's a bunch of
01:27:56.400 horseshit is because you know what's the
01:27:57.760 best in life
01:27:58.639 all the things that are good from ever
01:28:00.719 everybody else's culture
01:28:01.920 like the reason people live in major
01:28:03.760 cities is to go to
01:28:04.960 all the different restaurants from all
01:28:06.560 of the different cultures yeah and why
01:28:07.920 is cultural
01:28:08.880 i'm so confused as to why cultural
01:28:10.400 appropriation is bad cultural
01:28:11.520 appropriation is the greatest thing that
01:28:12.800 has ever happened to planet earth
01:28:14.159 if we're all siloed off into our own
01:28:16.080 little culture you know how much things
01:28:17.199 would suck
01:28:17.840 it would just be terrible so this kind
01:28:20.080 of yeah this kind of stuff is just crazy
01:28:21.440 it drives me nuts i look i
01:28:23.120 grew up teaching taekwondo which is a
01:28:25.920 korean martial art
01:28:27.280 i learned to count in korean i had to
01:28:30.320 speak
01:28:30.719 all the techniques in korean i hate
01:28:32.480 koreans clearly i mean that's clearly
01:28:34.159 the problem i culturally appropriated
01:28:35.600 the [ __ ] out of my childhood yeah
01:28:37.040 exactly
01:28:37.600 it's this is all this is all crazy and
01:28:39.280 there's no there's no
01:28:40.880 apparent end to it like there's no
01:28:42.000 limiting principle there's no limit
01:28:43.600 there's no limit i read a column this
01:28:44.960 morning by somebody i think it was in
01:28:46.400 the washington post
01:28:47.360 saying that we should just keep changing
01:28:48.800 the name of everything like literally
01:28:50.320 forever we should just keep changing the
01:28:51.760 name of everything she said
01:28:52.880 you know there's this town and i think i
01:28:54.480 found a non-offensive name for the town
01:28:55.760 but if i found something else that was
01:28:56.880 offensive like three years from now we
01:28:58.239 should change the name of the town
01:28:59.679 there's not a case we are living in 1984
01:29:01.679 right yo orwell talked about renaming
01:29:03.360 everything man
01:29:04.400 people will find a way they'll find a
01:29:06.800 way to be mad
01:29:07.840 well here's my here's my controversial
01:29:09.600 statement okay okay if you uh my
01:29:11.280 controversial statement is
01:29:12.639 if you have to go this far to find
01:29:14.639 things to be offended over
01:29:15.840 there's not that much to be offended
01:29:17.120 over if you have to get go so far
01:29:18.960 that you have to be offended by trader
01:29:20.159 jose's you got nothing going on in your
01:29:22.560 life
01:29:23.120 there's a dramatic demand for being
01:29:24.639 offended and acting like a victim
01:29:26.159 and they're just like they're actual
01:29:27.840 victims in this country yes and
01:29:29.040 internationally they're seriously actual
01:29:30.719 victims
01:29:31.199 yeah but we don't focus on any of those
01:29:32.560 folks right we focus instead on like the
01:29:34.639 dumbest bull crap you ever heard
01:29:36.719 you know about about renaming libraries
01:29:38.960 and listen i'm fine with you want to
01:29:40.320 move you want to take a confederate
01:29:41.440 statute and put a museum fine i mean
01:29:42.639 those guys were jerks
01:29:43.600 they're they're terrible people fine go
01:29:45.040 go for it but you're talking about
01:29:46.800 we're going to fix the world by renaming
01:29:49.360 washington dc because washington was bad
01:29:51.360 it's like what did you do lately did you
01:29:52.719 do washington did like i understand we
01:29:54.239 don't put up statues to people for all
01:29:55.440 the bad crap they did martin luther king
01:29:56.960 had a real bad record with
01:29:58.159 ladies okay we don't put up statues to
01:29:59.600 martin luther king because we were
01:30:00.719 saying he was great with with women
01:30:02.320 i think everybody was bad with women
01:30:03.679 back then everyone is bad period human
01:30:06.159 beings suck
01:30:06.880 okay so either get rid of all the
01:30:08.000 statues and recognize the human beings
01:30:09.920 obviously for sure and there are
01:30:11.280 gradations of suck do you remember back
01:30:13.120 when they were tearing down the civil
01:30:14.480 war statues and
01:30:15.520 and trump in all his wisdom was like
01:30:17.840 what are they gonna do next
01:30:18.880 what about lincoln what about uh they're
01:30:20.639 gonna take down george washington and
01:30:22.080 everybody's like oh he's so
01:30:23.199 crazy meanwhile that's exactly what
01:30:25.280 they're doing that was what they were
01:30:26.719 doing the what
01:30:27.679 i mean in chicago well actually that was
01:30:30.159 actually christopher columbus who was
01:30:31.440 legitimately a bad guy
01:30:33.360 he was i mean yes also everyone
01:30:36.719 was bad like literally all the people
01:30:38.639 were like enslavement
01:30:40.000 brutal brutal treatment of people right
01:30:42.000 fairly commonplace do you think it's
01:30:43.679 there's an argument to be said that
01:30:45.840 maybe we shouldn't celebrate those bad
01:30:47.840 people anymore that we know
01:30:49.199 what they now that we know what they
01:30:50.800 really were not really i think we should
01:30:51.840 just talk about the bad people like i
01:30:53.120 don't think we're the only good people
01:30:54.159 in history
01:30:54.719 i think they should have a statue of
01:30:57.040 genghis khan
01:30:58.480 i don't know what did genghis khan do
01:30:59.600 that was good that had good results well
01:31:01.440 he opened up trade to china okay if you
01:31:03.360 want to put up a trade to china statute
01:31:04.880 for genghis khan
01:31:06.080 federation 10 of the population yeah
01:31:09.040 true enough and
01:31:09.840 and what impregnated the other 10 or
01:31:11.840 something
01:31:13.040 everybody literally raped his way
01:31:15.199 through asia the point of a christopher
01:31:16.800 columbus statue is not all the bad
01:31:18.080 things he did to the arawaks the point
01:31:19.360 of a christopher columbus statue is we
01:31:20.719 are glad
01:31:21.280 that western civilization came to the
01:31:22.560 western hemisphere i kind of agree with
01:31:24.080 that principle
01:31:24.800 i think it is a good thing that western
01:31:26.159 civilization came to the western
01:31:27.199 hemisphere and yes there's a lot of
01:31:28.560 brutality and yes there was a lot of
01:31:29.760 cruelty we should talk about all those
01:31:31.040 things
01:31:31.520 but this notion that the only cruelty
01:31:34.000 that has ever existed in human history
01:31:35.360 came at the behest of western
01:31:36.320 civilization
01:31:37.199 that everything was a rusoli in paradise
01:31:38.880 before christopher columbus came
01:31:40.719 that christopher columbus doesn't
01:31:42.000 deserve a statue in specific
01:31:44.000 that we should that that like either
01:31:45.920 make the argument that everybody was a
01:31:47.520 product of their time and therefore no
01:31:48.560 one deserves a statue
01:31:49.920 or recognized that when there's a statue
01:31:51.760 of christopher columbus we are not
01:31:52.800 honoring how he treated the arrowwalks
01:31:54.400 no one ever thought that we put up a
01:31:56.159 statue to christopher columbus because
01:31:57.520 he was really
01:31:58.080 sweet to the natives on the other end of
01:31:59.920 that right that nobody
01:32:01.280 so what is the purpose of a statue like
01:32:03.520 when you have a christopher columbus
01:32:05.199 statue like what is the purpose of that
01:32:07.040 statue
01:32:07.920 we not we all know who he is we all know
01:32:10.080 what he did why do we have an
01:32:12.159 enormous bronze version of him in the
01:32:14.719 middle of a park
01:32:15.600 i mean presumably to say that western
01:32:17.120 civilization arriving here was
01:32:18.639 a good thing right or to have the
01:32:20.320 conversation i mean that's that's
01:32:21.840 it's a monument to a in historical event
01:32:24.960 right
01:32:25.440 right or listen columbia university is
01:32:27.440 named after columbus right
01:32:28.639 the idea of america as colombia right
01:32:30.320 which was an alternative name for
01:32:31.520 america
01:32:32.159 was after columbus because he was a
01:32:33.360 discoverer well that's a weird one right
01:32:35.199 we're we're named after amerigo vespucci
01:32:37.520 who nobody knows who the [ __ ] that guy
01:32:39.040 is yeah he's been lost in the time he's
01:32:40.880 totally been lost but
01:32:42.320 but there is this idea that has settled
01:32:43.840 in that we and it's really
01:32:45.600 of high irritation to me that we are now
01:32:47.280 the only good people who have ever lived
01:32:49.120 everyone who came before us was just a
01:32:50.560 horrible person and we are the only good
01:32:52.639 humans who have ever like
01:32:54.159 isn't the world lucky to have us we're
01:32:55.679 the only people who have ever lived who
01:32:56.960 are completely sinless and we can look
01:32:58.480 from our perch
01:32:59.280 at the top of morality at everyone who
01:33:00.880 came before us and say that those people
01:33:02.719 were all garbage compared to us now
01:33:04.639 there were people who were garbage
01:33:05.679 compared to us
01:33:06.480 but i really don't think that washington
01:33:08.320 was among the people who you can say was
01:33:09.840 garbage compared to you like i don't
01:33:11.280 think that you living in 1770 are a
01:33:12.960 better person
01:33:13.679 than george washington i think you stand
01:33:15.120 atop the legacy that george washington
01:33:16.560 hell built well i have news for those
01:33:18.400 people that were trying to break into
01:33:19.679 amazon go history is going to look back
01:33:21.760 at you like you're a piece of [ __ ] the
01:33:23.600 people in the future that would never
01:33:25.760 shatter property and never spray paint
01:33:28.480 things
01:33:29.360 and and never attack people for filming
01:33:31.679 things with their cell phones
01:33:33.120 they're going to look back at these
01:33:34.239 violent actions and they're going to
01:33:36.000 look back
01:33:36.639 and they're not going to be kind they're
01:33:38.560 the same one i mean
01:33:39.760 it's every single generation
01:33:42.960 hopefully if society doesn't implode we
01:33:45.520 don't have nuclear war
01:33:47.440 every single generation is going to
01:33:50.480 learn from the mistakes of the past and
01:33:52.080 hopefully improve
01:33:53.120 that's what we're hoping for and we
01:33:55.600 should be happy
01:33:56.719 that we can look back on a lot of these
01:33:59.520 people
01:34:00.320 and say we understand now how deeply
01:34:02.719 flawed they were and what
01:34:04.000 was wrong with george washington or
01:34:06.000 what's what was wrong
01:34:07.520 with thomas jefferson although he did
01:34:10.000 you know draft the declaration of
01:34:11.360 independence he was a slave owner
01:34:13.199 and this is one of the contradictions of
01:34:14.719 our society and our culture though we
01:34:16.159 fathered kids with a slave i mean yes
01:34:17.360 yes i mean
01:34:18.320 you don't have to shortchange the evils
01:34:20.000 of human beings in order to recognize
01:34:22.239 either the direction of american history
01:34:24.639 or recognize the good things about
01:34:25.679 people people are a little more complex
01:34:26.960 than i think we want to think of them
01:34:28.320 yes and this is one of the arenas that
01:34:31.199 this sort of gets back to the point
01:34:32.480 about the system
01:34:33.840 if you recognize that human beings are
01:34:36.159 capable of great sin and also capable of
01:34:38.159 doing great things
01:34:39.280 what you really want is a system that
01:34:41.600 that
01:34:42.800 of checks and balances that prevents
01:34:44.159 people from gaining too much power to
01:34:45.760 hurt other people
01:34:46.639 and what you also want to recognize is
01:34:48.320 that the flaws
01:34:49.760 of human beings are not necessarily the
01:34:51.280 flaws of the system and that just
01:34:52.800 changing the system is not going to
01:34:54.400 change the underlying flaws of human
01:34:56.239 beings which means you actually have to
01:34:57.679 think through the policies that you're
01:34:58.800 promulgating before you implement them
01:35:00.400 clearly if you say this
01:35:02.000 you're not paying attention to what
01:35:03.280 happened at chazz or chop
01:35:05.280 because they they had it nailed it was
01:35:06.960 paradise for a short period of time
01:35:09.440 that's one of my favorite stories of
01:35:11.360 this year because
01:35:12.880 these people basically took over this
01:35:15.760 gigantic chunk of seattle and said we're
01:35:18.080 going to show you how it's done
01:35:19.760 they wind up being the police they want
01:35:21.760 to beating the [ __ ] out of people who
01:35:23.440 did anything they didn't want them to do
01:35:24.719 including film things
01:35:26.080 they wind up see you saw murder you saw
01:35:29.040 massive graffiti you
01:35:30.320 certainly saw borders there were borders
01:35:32.639 put up they kept cops from coming in
01:35:34.560 they kept a lot of people from coming in
01:35:36.000 enough journalists the beat up
01:35:37.119 journalists they uh took over private
01:35:39.440 property so they appropriated private
01:35:41.119 property these are not buildings they
01:35:42.320 built
01:35:42.800 they didn't make a deal they didn't
01:35:44.239 barter they didn't have some sort of a a
01:35:46.320 beautiful mutually beneficial
01:35:47.840 agreement with these people that own
01:35:48.960 these buildings no [ __ ] you they took
01:35:50.480 them over they took them over and
01:35:51.679 started spray painting [ __ ] all over
01:35:53.119 them
01:35:53.600 it's crazy but it shows you like your
01:35:58.480 child-like child-like idea of
01:36:01.600 what you can do that's better you don't
01:36:05.040 take in
01:36:05.600 that you don't really understand that
01:36:07.520 the founding fathers really did put into
01:36:09.520 play
01:36:10.159 into place all these checks and balances
01:36:12.080 to keep someone
01:36:13.280 from abusing power and as much as trump
01:36:15.520 would like to overcome all that
01:36:17.440 you see time and time again he's a great
01:36:20.560 example
01:36:21.360 in in many ways of how this system
01:36:23.360 really is beautifully engineered
01:36:25.199 from 300 [ __ ] years ago because the
01:36:28.000 founders didn't understand the
01:36:29.199 the problem of human nature which is
01:36:30.880 people want power and they want to hurt
01:36:32.639 other people very often
01:36:33.760 and you still need government in order
01:36:35.040 to do things but there better be broad
01:36:36.400 scale agreement on the things you want
01:36:37.600 to do
01:36:38.000 or a small majority of people can really
01:36:40.400 hurt
01:36:41.040 a huge minority of people right this is
01:36:43.199 what they call tyranny of the mob right
01:36:44.880 they were they were much afraid of this
01:36:46.159 and and that's stuff that is worth
01:36:48.400 remembering you know the tearing down
01:36:50.000 that system because you want to build
01:36:51.280 something more beautiful
01:36:52.080 if it looks like chas or chop that ain't
01:36:54.239 a thing what's this idealistic
01:36:56.400 they have blinders on they have this
01:36:58.239 this narrow
01:36:59.520 tunnel vision view of what they think
01:37:01.600 this utopian future could be
01:37:03.119 i think they think that human beings are
01:37:04.320 going to be fundamentally transformed by
01:37:06.080 a different system yeah so they look at
01:37:07.600 the problems
01:37:08.560 one of the biggest problems we have in
01:37:09.679 american politics is the myopia with
01:37:11.280 which we look at the united states
01:37:12.719 so when you're dating somebody it's very
01:37:14.719 easy to see all the problems with the
01:37:16.080 person you're dating
01:37:16.960 when you're married to someone it's
01:37:17.840 certainly easy for my wife to see all
01:37:19.280 the problems with me and there are
01:37:20.159 plenty
01:37:20.880 but when she looks at all the other
01:37:22.080 people then she's like okay well he's
01:37:23.280 less flawed than the others right
01:37:24.639 when you look at the united states it's
01:37:25.920 very easy to see all the different flaws
01:37:27.440 in the united states because of course
01:37:28.480 they exist this is a society filled with
01:37:30.320 humans 330 million of them
01:37:32.400 but when you look abroad and you look at
01:37:34.000 other examples of civilizations over
01:37:35.600 time and then you look back at the
01:37:36.719 united states you think maybe the system
01:37:38.560 isn't quite that bad because the fact is
01:37:40.560 that for all the problems we got
01:37:42.159 the biggest problems that humanity faces
01:37:44.320 and has faced are not happening in the
01:37:45.760 united states they're happening
01:37:46.960 everywhere else china right now is
01:37:48.800 shipping
01:37:49.520 weaker muslims on trains after shaving
01:37:51.440 their heads to concentration camps where
01:37:52.880 they are being forcibly sterilized
01:37:54.480 there are actual problems on planet
01:37:55.679 earth that is not to say there aren't
01:37:57.360 problems in the united states but they
01:37:58.639 are not
01:37:59.199 the same in terms of degree and they are
01:38:00.880 not the same in terms of scope
01:38:02.560 and to pretend that the system of the
01:38:04.239 united states needs to be ripped down
01:38:06.320 from the inside
01:38:07.440 and that if you build a beautiful new
01:38:08.880 system you will shape humanity such that
01:38:10.639 we are all saints and no sinners
01:38:12.080 you're out of your mind i agree with you
01:38:13.920 and it's it's the uyghur
01:38:15.360 situation is shockingly undercovered oh
01:38:17.920 my god well it just it demonstrates that
01:38:19.440 when people said never again they were
01:38:20.400 full of crap they're just full of crap i
01:38:21.760 mean it's not true
01:38:22.880 in the the this is one area where the
01:38:24.239 united states should absolutely be
01:38:25.920 taking a leading role it is obvious that
01:38:27.520 china is a nefarious actor
01:38:29.040 china's been stealing our technology
01:38:30.639 china's the chinese government is
01:38:32.159 attempting to extend its rule of tyranny
01:38:34.400 over hong kong they just subjected 7.5
01:38:36.320 million people to their direct tyranny
01:38:37.760 in violation of trading
01:38:39.199 and the response has basically been
01:38:40.719 muted from the western world
01:38:42.320 and did you see that did you see that
01:38:43.600 video of the uh the chinese
01:38:46.000 ambassador in britain being asked on the
01:38:47.440 bbc about that tape no i didn't
01:38:49.520 it's fantastic so the bbc interviewer
01:38:51.199 shows him the tape of the people being
01:38:52.880 pushed onto trains right
01:38:54.320 and he says what is this and the chinese
01:38:57.280 ambassador says
01:38:58.000 i can't see it i'm not sure what you're
01:38:59.119 talking about he's literally saying that
01:39:00.239 the screen is huge it's right behind him
01:39:01.760 like he's looking right at it
01:39:02.960 and he acts as though he can't see it
01:39:04.400 and then he starts talking about the
01:39:05.600 natural beauty of the region
01:39:07.679 right he he he won't he won't deal with
01:39:09.600 it he won't he won't explain what it is
01:39:12.480 and the rest of the world is just like
01:39:14.239 well you know what this is where
01:39:16.080 you know in the sporting world the the
01:39:18.480 whole the story that's undercover in the
01:39:20.080 sporting world is the
01:39:20.880 is the blowback on that the nba gave to
01:39:23.360 daryl mori the the
01:39:24.880 houston rockets jam for saying free hong
01:39:26.400 kong right you can't even get anybody in
01:39:28.000 the nba to condemn china while china's
01:39:29.760 subjecting a million uyghurs to abject
01:39:31.920 slavery
01:39:32.800 mark cuban just had an exchange with uh
01:39:35.040 ted cruz the other day
01:39:36.320 where where he was going after cruz for
01:39:38.639 something and cruz said
01:39:39.440 just you know he questioned cruz cruz's
01:39:41.840 balls or something and cruz came back
01:39:43.280 and said well do you have the balls to
01:39:44.320 condemn china
01:39:45.199 and cuban said something like well you
01:39:47.679 know i don't want to
01:39:48.480 i don't want to get involved in the
01:39:49.679 internal affairs of another country i
01:39:50.960 thought well that's
01:39:52.719 that is not an internal affairs question
01:39:54.320 it's one thing to say i don't want to
01:39:55.280 get involved in the tax rates of other
01:39:56.719 countries another thing to say
01:39:58.159 shaving people's heads shipping them on
01:39:59.360 trains to concentration camps where you
01:40:01.119 force them into labor and or sterilize
01:40:02.880 them
01:40:03.199 that seems like not an internal issue
01:40:04.960 that you're not allowed to criticize
01:40:06.239 really
01:40:06.719 yeah that's a big one but the the china
01:40:09.040 thing is so crazy because so many
01:40:11.119 so many business interests have this
01:40:13.920 connection with them
01:40:15.040 and so much of the the money that they
01:40:17.760 generate
01:40:18.800 is because of china i mean the nba films
01:40:22.080 there's
01:40:23.119 there's so much so much of our culture
01:40:25.520 that kowtows to china we're so connected
01:40:27.440 to them that's one of the things that we
01:40:28.560 really found out
01:40:29.440 from this pandemic is how many things
01:40:30.800 are built there how much of our medicine
01:40:32.639 how much we rely on china
01:40:34.639 it also demonstrates the lie of the idea
01:40:36.320 that if you trade with somebody then
01:40:37.440 they're going to liberalize
01:40:38.560 yeah and that was that was something
01:40:39.600 that was pushed over the last 30 40
01:40:40.960 years real hard which is
01:40:42.320 we'll help them out economically we'll
01:40:43.679 have mutual trade it'll be good for both
01:40:45.119 of us and they'll liberalize because
01:40:46.960 once they realize it's good to be part
01:40:48.239 of the world economy then they won't be
01:40:49.920 pirates anymore instead they just took
01:40:51.119 all the chips off the table and said
01:40:52.400 no actually i'm going to double down on
01:40:53.520 this and we're going to get more
01:40:54.480 tyrannical not less i mean
01:40:56.080 she is the most powerful chinese leader
01:40:57.600 since mao it's incredible
01:40:59.760 we don't have much time you have a heart
01:41:01.440 out in one minute i just want to know
01:41:03.199 what what do you think goes down in
01:41:04.560 november and how hopeful are you for the
01:41:06.639 future
01:41:07.199 because it seems to me like we're [ __ ]
01:41:08.719 no matter who wins because the chaos
01:41:10.800 that we're seeing the civil unrest we're
01:41:12.239 seeing
01:41:12.800 it's going to either accelerate or or or
01:41:16.000 or spread one way or the other so i
01:41:18.639 think that
01:41:19.280 if we're going to hold together we have
01:41:20.560 to make a decision either fundamentally
01:41:22.480 the american system is good but flawed
01:41:24.159 we need to work on the flaws within the
01:41:25.360 system
01:41:25.920 or fundamentally the american system
01:41:27.600 sucks and was rooted in slavery and
01:41:29.199 bigotry and we need to rip down the
01:41:30.400 entire system
01:41:31.760 the latter is not really a great recipe
01:41:34.000 so we can have normal political
01:41:35.360 arguments within the former or the
01:41:36.800 country is toast
01:41:37.760 as far as what goes down in november
01:41:40.800 look right now the polling data says
01:41:42.000 trump gets gunked i mean right now the
01:41:43.360 polling data's got biden up
01:41:44.800 10 12 points in the polls but didn't the
01:41:46.560 polling data in 2016 say that hillary
01:41:48.960 was going to steamroll
01:41:49.840 on the national data nuts on the
01:41:51.679 national data they were kind of right so
01:41:52.960 on the national data the final real
01:41:54.239 clear politics poll average was like
01:41:55.520 three points hillary won by three points
01:41:57.199 in the popular vote
01:41:58.159 the state polls were really were really
01:42:00.480 wrong particularly in wisconsin and
01:42:02.000 michigan and pennsylvania
01:42:03.920 on this one because trump is universally
01:42:06.239 losing in like all the swing states and
01:42:07.760 is in spitting distance in texas
01:42:09.199 he's got a lot of ground to make up
01:42:10.800 right now listen biden is running almost
01:42:12.639 the ideal campaign he's not alive he's a
01:42:14.400 not alive person
01:42:15.440 and as it turns out beating a dead horse
01:42:17.280 is actually kind of tough
01:42:18.560 right he's like because
01:42:21.840 he's not threatening he's fundamentally
01:42:23.119 non-threatening you look at biden and
01:42:24.639 you feel threatened by i don't feel
01:42:25.600 threatened by and the man's not alive
01:42:26.880 you can't threaten me with a corpse
01:42:28.239 right and so and so trump who is
01:42:30.480 innately volatile and looking for
01:42:31.920 something to kind of attack is his own
01:42:33.360 worst enemy it's his own worst enemy
01:42:34.800 like with hillary
01:42:35.600 the untold story of 2016 is that trump
01:42:37.199 didn't win hillary lost people
01:42:39.040 hated hillary's guts and the stat that
01:42:40.719 proves it is that people who hated both
01:42:42.159 trump and hillary
01:42:43.280 broke for trump pretty heavily right now
01:42:45.280 people who don't like either biden or
01:42:46.960 trump are breaking nearly universally
01:42:48.320 for biden
01:42:49.040 because trump is so off-putting and you
01:42:51.679 know i've said for a long time politics
01:42:53.280 is about the art of making it hard to
01:42:54.560 vote for your opponent and easy to vote
01:42:55.840 for you
01:42:56.560 and trump is fairly good at number one
01:42:58.560 and he is awful he is god awful at
01:43:00.320 number two
01:43:00.880 making it easy to vote for him that
01:43:02.960 that's that's a toughy
01:43:04.080 well said well said thank you ben
01:43:05.679 shapiro always a good time man
01:43:08.080 always enjoy seeing you all right that's
