00:00:34.320 family man it was something that god put
00:00:37.520 on my heart
00:00:38.160 back in 2015 uh
00:00:41.600 a few days before the mtv awards it just
00:00:44.320 it hit me in the shower
00:00:46.320 and when i first thought of it i just
00:00:48.160 started
00:00:49.680 like laughing to myself and it
00:00:53.280 like all this like joy came over my
00:00:56.640 over my body just through my soul and
00:00:59.840 i could just i i just felt that energy i
00:01:02.399 felt that spirit so then two days later
00:01:04.959 i uh accepted the michael jackson video
00:01:07.360 vanguard awards
00:01:08.479 at the uh mtv awards and um
00:01:11.680 instead of performing you know my array
00:01:15.040 of hit songs
00:01:16.560 you know i gave uh just my perspective
00:01:20.320 on award shows
00:01:21.759 but always i knew at the end i was going
00:01:24.560 to tell people i'm running for
00:01:26.000 office i'm running for president in
00:01:27.840 2020.
00:01:29.439 and you know just to have the
00:01:32.560 it it even took heart to say it in that
00:01:36.640 context and people were just like oh
00:01:38.880 like their their minds are blown
00:01:41.040 and then i was hanging out with
00:01:42.640 different i had different friends
00:01:45.439 that were you know some people in the
00:01:48.320 music industry
00:01:49.119 some people tech elites different things
00:01:51.280 like that and
00:01:52.240 they would um really
00:01:55.680 you know they just really took it as a
00:01:57.759 joke
00:01:59.119 and they're telling me all these
00:02:00.799 millions of reasons why i couldn't run
00:02:02.399 for president i remember running into
00:02:03.840 oprah
00:02:04.560 two days or one day after that and she's
00:02:06.799 like yeah i want to be president and
00:02:08.639 you know people just you know thought
00:02:11.280 projecting putting this on you
00:02:13.120 and i i remember saying uh one of my
00:02:16.239 responses
00:02:17.440 to one of the people that one of the
00:02:19.200 naysayers was
00:02:20.480 well definitely be a billionaire by
00:02:23.680 that time uh and not that that's a
00:02:26.400 reason why someone should
00:02:27.760 become president but it's to say you
00:02:30.400 know
00:02:31.680 at that time i was uh
00:02:35.040 50 around 50 million dollars in debt
00:02:38.480 and i knew i had the confidence
00:02:41.519 that i would be able to turn that around
00:02:44.080 and
00:02:45.040 now you know just going into
00:02:48.480 i want to just give you a a yeah that
00:02:50.560 that's a clear answer
00:02:51.920 right someone i know what you're saying
00:02:53.040 i don't i don't want to go off on two of
00:02:54.160 them no it's okay
00:02:55.040 yeah what you're basically saying is you
00:02:56.400 know how to set goals you know to
00:02:57.760 achieve them
00:02:58.560 but what was oprah's rationale when she
00:03:00.800 said you don't want to be the president
00:03:02.000 like what was she saying because i
00:03:03.519 remember when people were saying that
00:03:05.440 that's our next president
00:03:06.720 remember when trump got elected you know
00:03:09.040 they showed oprah and they were saying
00:03:10.800 like there
00:03:11.360 was i believe it was like nbc tweeted it
00:03:13.760 this is our next president
00:03:15.519 like they a lot of people wanted oprah
00:03:17.599 to want to run and they felt like if
00:03:19.280 trump could win
00:03:20.480 oprah could win when i saw trump win i
00:03:23.120 was like
00:03:23.760 see you can win
00:03:27.040 you know i was um you can win if you're
00:03:29.440 coming from outside of politics i was
00:03:31.040 young when ronald reagan
00:03:32.080 was in was president i don't remember
00:03:34.080 ronald reagan was the governor of
00:03:35.360 california before he was the president
00:03:36.799 he had actually proven himself as a
00:03:38.159 politician
00:03:39.040 at least somewhat which is an idea that
00:03:41.120 people have thrown out at me
00:03:42.959 to to be governor california to be
00:03:45.440 governor of california
00:03:46.799 anyone's better than this guy
00:03:49.840 just do just go ahead start there get a
00:03:53.120 shot
00:03:53.840 open things up again man but i think and
00:03:56.480 i think
00:03:56.879 my calling is to be uh i i
00:04:00.480 believe that my calling is to be
00:04:03.920 the leader of the free world not not
00:04:07.200 i mean if if it's in god's plan that
00:04:09.439 part of my path is to be
00:04:11.519 the governor then that's fine but my
00:04:13.680 call is to be the leader of the free
00:04:14.959 world so when you say this like when you
00:04:16.320 say your calling is to be the leader of
00:04:18.000 the free world
00:04:18.639 what what does that mean to you does
00:04:20.320 that does it mean do you have a plan
00:04:22.240 that's different
00:04:23.120 than the plans that have been
00:04:24.320 implemented before does it mean that
00:04:26.400 you have ideas what kind of plan like
00:04:28.400 the plan to be the leader like what
00:04:30.080 would you do
00:04:30.880 if you were the leader of the free world
00:04:33.040 like what would be different about the
00:04:34.639 way you would handle things
00:04:36.080 like if that's your plan like what is it
00:04:38.080 about that that that is your calling
00:04:40.800 like why why would you want to do that
00:04:42.560 like what do you want to do differently
00:04:44.479 if you were the leader of the free world
00:04:46.880 well
00:04:48.240 um well there was a couple questions in
00:04:51.440 there you said why is
00:04:52.479 you know why is that your calling
00:04:54.400 there's people who will say to me
00:04:56.160 you know they'll say well music is
00:04:59.199 bigger than politics or more influential
00:05:01.680 than politics or celebrities or more
00:05:03.520 influential
00:05:04.800 and uh i thought of it like if i was a
00:05:08.400 pastor
00:05:09.280 of a hundred thousand person church but
00:05:12.080 then i was also
00:05:13.120 um uh a captain a sailor
00:05:16.720 and then we went to war and i said i'm
00:05:19.520 gonna
00:05:20.160 man this ship that has a thousand people
00:05:24.240 a thousand soldiers on it because god is
00:05:26.240 calling me
00:05:28.240 to take this position even though
00:05:32.800 i'm the pastor for you know
00:05:35.840 however big my audience is in hip-hop
00:05:39.520 uh in music or as a just an influencer
00:05:42.160 or celebrity
00:05:43.520 uh or just as a dad
00:05:46.639 and a husband in my house
00:05:50.479 the world is like
00:05:54.080 there couldn't be a better time to put a
00:05:56.479 visionary
00:05:57.600 in the in the captain's chair um
00:06:02.160 and that's not to say we we haven't had
00:06:03.759 visionaries be
00:06:05.280 uh before i'm not coming here to down
00:06:08.800 any of the other uh i'm not here to down
00:06:12.319 trump down biden uh i'm just here to
00:06:15.520 express
00:06:16.080 why um
00:06:20.639 uh why god has called me
00:06:25.039 to take this position so when you say a
00:06:26.880 visionary you think of yourself
00:06:28.800 in in terms of like as an artist as a
00:06:30.880 creator some someone who has
00:06:33.520 these thoughts that they manifest in in
00:06:35.680 terms of music and art creation design
00:06:38.080 the things that you do
00:06:39.280 that's why you you think you're
00:06:41.360 different
00:06:42.319 as a visionary yeah i
00:06:45.520 i i think that i think i'm different
00:06:48.800 from
00:06:50.319 i mean we're all different so i'm
00:06:52.080 definitely different from everybody
00:06:53.120 we're all different from each other
00:06:54.639 i mean i do bump into people that seem
00:06:57.440 to be like the same character inside of
00:07:00.080 yeah it's like i've said people before
00:07:02.720 yeah people play the same roles like
00:07:04.240 well i just met you before that you're
00:07:06.000 just like the head of this company over
00:07:07.440 here you're the same kind of person
00:07:09.039 um yeah you know i mean i manifest
00:07:12.960 i see things i'm a great leader
00:07:16.000 because i listen and i'm empathetic
00:07:19.280 and i feel the entire
00:07:22.400 earth and i feel us as a as a species
00:07:25.759 as the the human race like i do
00:07:28.319 sometimes people think of
00:07:30.160 uh utopia as almost like a negative word
00:07:33.680 that's
00:07:34.000 that's like we couldn't have that but i
00:07:36.880 do believe in
00:07:38.319 world peace like the people hit me with
00:07:41.120 the
00:07:41.440 one of the things oprah said is she said
00:07:42.960 you got to bone up on your foreign
00:07:44.720 affairs i remember this
00:07:46.240 like because it's oprah talking so i'm
00:07:47.680 going to remember a lot of what the
00:07:49.199 conversation was but that's the first
00:07:50.800 thing
00:07:51.520 she said was you know uh foreign affairs
00:07:55.360 and
00:07:56.000 foreign policies like just i think the
00:07:58.319 reason why i say
00:07:59.120 leader and that politician and not even
00:08:02.080 specifically uh
00:08:03.199 president is uh
00:08:07.520 this is the time you know when when the
00:08:09.440 constitution
00:08:10.560 was written that was an innovation now
00:08:14.160 the world is innovated
00:08:17.680 all around our political system
00:08:21.280 but we haven't innovated and simplified
00:08:23.919 our political system so i met with
00:08:26.080 um this gentleman sam uh one of the
00:08:28.720 founders of y combinator so y combinator
00:08:31.199 is a a um
00:08:34.799 is a contract that my friend the head of
00:08:37.839 dropbox used
00:08:39.519 um and that a lot of tech guys use and
00:08:41.679 it's a standardized deal
00:08:43.440 so one of the ideas i had when i was um
00:08:48.240 as i'm in this process of innovating i'm
00:08:50.000 not i'm not in
00:08:51.279 war with the music industry it's just
00:08:53.279 it's time for us to innovate
00:08:54.959 uh and we need to have contracts that
00:08:58.320 make sense with exactly how we sell
00:09:00.240 music so
00:09:01.600 you know people every vicinia and that's
00:09:03.920 like uh
00:09:04.640 every 20 years that's like the like
00:09:07.440 decade is 10
00:09:08.720 vicinia is 20. and as you see now it's
00:09:11.279 like the world is just
00:09:12.959 stopped for a second and there's an
00:09:14.720 opportunity to look
00:09:16.800 and say what are the things we need what
00:09:18.480 are the things we don't need so
00:09:20.000 i don't know if you saw when i posted my
00:09:21.279 contract i had 10 contracts
00:09:23.279 that kept on putting me inside a
00:09:24.800 labyrinth and there's things that we
00:09:27.200 don't need now
00:09:28.000 i believe that the distribution
00:09:31.920 partner that the label is like prince
00:09:33.920 would go and say
00:09:35.360 oh we don't need the distribution
00:09:36.959 partner especially if prince
00:09:38.480 was you know really alive and thriving
00:09:41.279 in this
00:09:41.839 internet era i'm the kind of person
00:09:44.959 where
00:09:46.080 i'm not trying to go and eliminate
00:09:48.720 anyone's
00:09:49.519 job so record labels are afraid of
00:09:52.720 saying okay we're going to hand over the
00:09:54.720 distribution
00:09:55.920 completely to you guys which is you know
00:09:57.920 that's a possibility
00:10:00.560 there's a way where both parties
00:10:04.640 can be happy and that these
00:10:06.880 infrastructure partners can be
00:10:08.720 of service to the influencer
00:10:12.160 to the artists like these these deals
00:10:15.760 can be
00:10:18.000 flipped in a way that they're just more
00:10:19.600 fair uh you know
00:10:22.959 a record and i'll just let let me just
00:10:24.959 go into the specific uh
00:10:27.200 place with the record labels for a
00:10:28.399 second yeah i'm talking about that this
00:10:30.079 is a confusing thing for people on the
00:10:31.519 outside
00:10:32.240 yeah so before when i told my father i
00:10:36.000 wanted to rap
00:10:36.959 he was uh very like
00:10:40.160 leery of that idea he said this
00:10:43.440 this i heard this business is terrible
00:10:45.600 and
00:10:46.800 you know he's right like people are all
00:10:49.360 seeing things that are wrong inside of
00:10:51.200 contracts
00:10:52.240 turning blind eyes to it and everyone's
00:10:55.200 responsible
00:10:56.480 everyone's a part of it you know it's
00:10:58.640 like when the me too movement
00:11:00.000 happened you know it wasn't just the
00:11:02.800 guys that were getting tagged and
00:11:04.480 you know some of the guys should have
00:11:06.240 got hit with it some guys shouldn't
00:11:07.920 you know that's not what i'm here to
00:11:09.040 talk about i'm saying that
00:11:11.279 in a way everyone's responsible
00:11:14.480 everyone's a part of the problem that's
00:11:16.560 why i really love that um
00:11:18.079 black mirror episode when you know
00:11:20.560 everyone was making comments
00:11:22.640 and anyone that even made a comment the
00:11:24.880 bees it was about these uh
00:11:26.800 you know uh mechanical bees anyone and
00:11:29.200 this is a spoiler
00:11:30.240 alert if you haven't seen this episode
00:11:31.600 but anyone who made a comment
00:11:34.320 the bees came to go get them and that's
00:11:36.640 the thing about what you put in the
00:11:38.399 universe even a thought
00:11:40.399 you know you put that thought into the
00:11:43.600 it's another thing to say something
00:11:46.320 negative and put that into the universe
00:11:47.920 it's another thing to see
00:11:49.920 someone being raped you know that's the
00:11:52.560 reason why i compare what's happening
00:11:54.079 to in the music industry to me too
00:11:56.560 because artists are raped you've heard
00:11:58.399 that term before i'm not this is not
00:11:59.839 like i'm it's not like a
00:12:01.680 new thing that i'm making up the the
00:12:04.079 contracts are made to rape
00:12:06.800 the artist and um
00:12:10.560 you know i put my like i i think about
00:12:14.800 you know this is like a thought that
00:12:17.279 right now it's like is this a
00:12:18.880 a negative thought that i'm putting into
00:12:20.320 the universe but i have to say like when
00:12:21.839 i was going on twitter i was thinking
00:12:23.200 about bruce and brandon lee
00:12:25.279 that crossed my mind to say i'm this is
00:12:28.160 sony
00:12:29.279 this is universal and i'm willing
00:12:32.639 to put the blue paint on my face
00:12:36.240 and go out and do this
00:12:41.519 because it's the right thing to do like
00:12:44.639 music like at this point it loses me
00:12:46.720 money it doesn't make
00:12:48.399 it doesn't make me money it is my my
00:12:51.360 five billion dollar
00:12:52.800 net worth and 300 million dollars of
00:12:54.959 cash that i see
00:12:55.920 a year music is like negative 4 million
00:13:00.079 for me so these contracts for me were
00:13:02.560 kind of like wang grow
00:13:03.760 and heat where this guy had everything
00:13:06.560 but he still said
00:13:08.160 wang grow messed up this this
00:13:11.279 uh this heist that we're going to do
00:13:13.440 like i look at the music industry and
00:13:15.200 that music and the love of music itself
00:13:16.720 but the music industry i look at it like
00:13:18.399 wang girl like i blame
00:13:23.120 you know the loss of my mother
00:13:27.440 partially on in the entertainment
00:13:31.360 industry the always fighting
00:13:34.800 to you know represent you know who you
00:13:38.399 are
00:13:39.199 against media entertainment in an
00:13:41.519 industry that's trying to tear down
00:13:43.680 anybody that's not uh going with the
00:13:46.000 flow i i see
00:13:48.160 you know i've got those kind of reasons
00:13:50.399 personally
00:13:51.360 uh but uh vengeance is mine said the
00:13:53.519 lord so it's not a matter of going
00:13:55.600 in for revenge that's just me as a human
00:13:58.079 being where i fall
00:13:58.880 short like i'm not a monk can you
00:14:00.399 explain what you're talking about with
00:14:01.519 bruce lee
00:14:02.000 and brandon lee like what i lost you
00:14:04.320 there okay so
00:14:05.920 bruce lee and brandon lee were both
00:14:08.800 murdered
00:14:10.399 well brandon lee died in an accident on
00:14:12.800 a movie set
00:14:14.160 yeah do you think it was a murder i felt
00:14:16.720 that's a conspiracy right the conspiracy
00:14:18.639 was that the
00:14:19.600 chinese triad killed him the same way
00:14:21.519 they killed bruce but
00:14:22.959 this the the coroner's report was that
00:14:25.199 bruce died
00:14:26.320 from uh a reaction to a medication right
00:14:30.240 yeah i mean but i think about that
00:14:32.320 anytime i go to the
00:14:33.839 go to the hospital i'm very you know i'm
00:14:37.199 mindful of that stuff you think about
00:14:38.800 like
00:14:39.279 bob marley they didn't just jfk or mlk
00:14:43.360 him there's like reports that it was
00:14:45.600 something in his toe
00:14:46.639 or he had cancer right i believe he had
00:14:48.880 a skin cancer
00:14:49.920 yeah like i went to go
00:14:53.199 uh i got a shot in my uh in my hand
00:14:56.880 because uh just from texting and stuff
00:14:58.399 my thumb was like hurt and then i told
00:15:00.240 you
00:15:00.480 so much you hurt your thumb absolutely
00:15:02.560 just texting way too much
00:15:04.560 so i post a picture
00:15:07.760 of uh the screen at the hospital
00:15:11.519 and then i was asked to take it down
00:15:15.920 by but who people just call them i
00:15:18.720 forget
00:15:19.199 exactly who asked me but it was like
00:15:21.519 they get they got to my management they
00:15:23.040 got to this and they said take that
00:15:24.160 picture down
00:15:25.360 like the hospital it was in the weirdest
00:15:27.680 place
00:15:28.720 you know so what what did they not like
00:15:31.040 about the picture
00:15:32.399 um i think it had like it might have had
00:15:35.519 some
00:15:35.839 information on it that they didn't want
00:15:38.000 to go out like an
00:15:38.880 address or something like that it's just
00:15:41.360 like but i don't want to go down
00:15:43.360 go down these rabbit holes i'm just
00:15:44.720 saying like michael jackson
00:15:47.279 not waking up one day prince not waking
00:15:50.079 up one day
00:15:51.440 bruce and brandon lee bob marley all of
00:15:54.720 these things
00:15:56.399 are have crossed my mind you know
00:15:59.440 as i'm going and saying i need to
00:16:02.320 innovate
00:16:03.279 what these contracts are not just for me
00:16:06.800 but for all artists it's not about me
00:16:09.680 getting my
00:16:10.800 masters back it's about
00:16:13.920 it's about freedom and i say on a new
00:16:18.000 song i say
00:16:19.199 if i would put myself in harm's way to
00:16:21.680 get my masters they would put their self
00:16:23.839 in harm's way
00:16:24.880 to stay the master and that's there's a
00:16:28.320 complete parallel to the way the music
00:16:30.560 industry works
00:16:31.920 and the way the world currently works
00:16:34.800 and the influence that
00:16:36.000 america has on other countries
00:16:40.079 and the way governments work uh the
00:16:42.959 influence
00:16:43.600 and the way government and the way
00:16:45.839 people in power
00:16:47.199 and control deal with
00:16:50.959 you know disaster relief deal deal with
00:16:53.279 haiti
00:16:54.079 deal with uh the bahamas
00:16:57.279 like where is the money going why aren't
00:17:00.240 things
00:17:01.120 being built and this concept of money
00:17:04.799 right i asked myself this um
00:17:07.839 uh i asked someone a week ago
00:17:11.280 like how much is america in debt and
00:17:13.439 they were like this many trillion
00:17:15.599 and then i asked my a rhetorical
00:17:17.280 question but the dumbest question i've
00:17:18.720 ever asked myself i said
00:17:20.400 well you know how much does the earth
00:17:22.079 cost
00:17:24.240 think of it think about a bad question
00:17:25.919 but but how much is the earth worth
00:17:27.679 yeah what is what is the earth what all
00:17:29.840 the things on earth
00:17:30.720 yeah and it's saying we can't buy it we
00:17:33.679 couldn't make enough money
00:17:35.280 to buy the earth right so that means we
00:17:38.160 made money
00:17:39.280 so if money is the key to
00:17:42.320 all people's happiness and we'll solve
00:17:44.080 everything and everyone's doing things
00:17:45.280 for money
00:17:46.000 let's just make more money but it's not
00:17:48.240 about making more money
00:17:49.760 it's about keeping poor people poor
00:17:52.960 and rich people rich and people keeping
00:17:55.840 people in their place
00:17:57.039 and right now we're experiencing the
00:17:59.679 fall of rome
00:18:00.799 or the titanic has now hit a glacier and
00:18:03.919 there's people who
00:18:05.360 would prefer to go down with the titanic
00:18:09.280 than to get on a lifeboat because they
00:18:11.200 don't want to get sea water on their
00:18:12.640 dress or on a nice outfit
00:18:14.480 the people are so programmed and
00:18:17.600 brainwashed
00:18:18.640 into uh classism and protectionism
00:18:22.880 that uh it's difficult
00:18:26.960 for people to embrace innovation
00:18:30.160 unless it has a tag on it
00:18:33.280 it's got a name brand connected to it
00:18:35.120 that says with this innovation you will
00:18:37.039 be better than the person
00:18:39.039 you'll be better than your next-door
00:18:40.400 neighbor you know when i made sunday
00:18:42.480 service
00:18:43.919 i i completely stopped rapping because i
00:18:46.400 didn't know how to rap
00:18:47.600 for god you know all my raps always had
00:18:50.160 like um
00:18:51.840 you know like nasty jokes on it and um
00:18:56.000 and then you know i made um
00:18:59.760 i made uh when i when i went to the
00:19:02.400 hospital i know you want to get into
00:19:03.760 this when i went to the hospital
00:19:05.600 in 2016 i wrote
00:19:09.280 uh start a church in calabasas and
00:19:12.400 as we left from 2018 going into 2019 i
00:19:15.280 said i'm not gonna let one sunday go by
00:19:17.679 without starting this church and there's
00:19:19.679 people who said it wasn't a church and
00:19:21.200 different things but
00:19:22.320 to start a ministry i'm like the little
00:19:24.160 drummer boy where i'm saying
00:19:25.520 you know this all i got to bring my my
00:19:27.440 drum i might not be
00:19:28.960 well versed in the word and but i i know
00:19:31.600 how to do make music and i know how to
00:19:33.120 put this choir together
00:19:34.480 and all things can be made good for god
00:19:37.840 so
00:19:38.559 it like quickly became the best choir of
00:19:40.880 all time because all the best singers
00:19:42.640 moved to california
00:19:44.559 and now but a lot of them grew up in the
00:19:46.400 church so it's like the opportunity
00:19:48.400 for for them to actually get paid
00:19:51.840 singing
00:19:52.400 for god because i would be funding it
00:19:54.240 and that for me was like a tithe
00:19:56.160 for me to fund sunday service and i was
00:19:58.640 four months in before i gave my life
00:20:01.440 to god like i wasn't saved it's just i
00:20:03.520 had a calling
00:20:04.480 saying just go make this church and the
00:20:07.520 whole thing
00:20:08.640 the comparison to this church to me
00:20:11.440 going and saying
00:20:12.640 okay why why am i running for president
00:20:16.320 is to be in service and that's service
00:20:18.640 to my my own ego
00:20:20.880 uh you know i feel like god says to me
00:20:24.320 like
00:20:25.840 haven't i given you enough and i gave
00:20:29.039 you an ego
00:20:30.159 that helped you overcome all these you
00:20:33.039 know roadblocks and smoke screens and
00:20:35.039 people telling you
00:20:36.240 what you can't do now you need to
00:20:37.600 realize when you're doing things for
00:20:39.520 your ego and when you're doing things
00:20:40.880 for me this is like
00:20:42.320 god the what i feel god is saying to me
00:20:46.159 uh because it really irritates me when
00:20:48.799 people say
00:20:49.840 god told me to tell you so
00:20:53.200 i'm very like mindful with this kind of
00:20:55.520 word and this i'm saying i have a
00:20:57.039 feeling that that's what god is saying
00:20:58.960 for me to be in service so
00:21:02.640 the ultimate service position is
00:21:06.640 leader of the free world to be the
00:21:08.159 president of the united states it's
00:21:09.840 sometimes you see me on twitter i'll say
00:21:11.520 i want all the smoke i want all the
00:21:12.880 problems because the problems
00:21:14.720 are the opportunities there's an
00:21:16.159 opportunity to solve things
00:21:18.799 and kurzweil uh he created the keyboard
00:21:21.760 kurzweil
00:21:22.799 uh he he has this video that marco manik
00:21:27.679 this uh director that shot 99 problems
00:21:30.000 for jay-z which is like
00:21:31.440 my favorite uh maybe like top five or
00:21:35.440 top two favorite videos of all time uh
00:21:37.760 he also did a
00:21:39.360 closer for trent rezner and i like
00:21:42.400 i just grew up on mtv in the 90s and i
00:21:44.559 love mark romantic videos but he would
00:21:46.640 share
00:21:47.679 um he'd share little bits and pieces i
00:21:50.559 remember ray curls
00:21:51.600 kurzweil talking about the ability for
00:21:54.480 us to have
00:21:55.200 a utopia but us being led by the least
00:21:59.039 noble
00:21:59.840 and the most greedy but if
00:22:03.840 someone or when someone gets in a
00:22:06.240 position
00:22:07.679 of leadership that
00:22:11.440 is in service to god and in service
00:22:15.280 to people period but
00:22:18.559 immediately the american people um
00:22:22.799 i had this joke i was saying like man no
00:22:24.640 one outside of our country should be
00:22:26.720 able to see these debates this is family
00:22:28.400 business right here this is only for
00:22:30.799 america to see we can't let anyone
00:22:32.559 outside the country see it but
00:22:34.640 to be in service so i i stepped away
00:22:38.320 already from my rap career for
00:22:41.679 a year and served
00:22:45.039 god every week sometimes twice a week
00:22:47.520 three times a week
00:22:48.559 never missed a sunday until covet
00:22:51.760 and um and this thing there were people
00:22:54.960 inside of the church stealing
00:22:57.120 doing different things trying to just
00:22:58.559 take them and god still provided a way
00:23:00.400 for us to keep that boat
00:23:02.159 afloat we never missed a we never missed
00:23:05.360 uh a service and then uh one of my
00:23:08.559 pastors pastor adam
00:23:10.080 who is uh uh uh
00:23:14.640 the way he preaches is is called
00:23:16.320 expository it's like
00:23:17.760 one to one by the word i like all
00:23:20.240 different kind of preachers but there's
00:23:21.200 some type of preachers they
00:23:22.880 they get up they have the bible in their
00:23:24.480 hand then they close the bible and then
00:23:26.000 they just talk for
00:23:27.280 uh two hours and it's and and
00:23:31.360 some do have anointing but the
00:23:32.960 expository preachers go
00:23:34.960 line for line and for me it's like i
00:23:36.720 come from entertainment
00:23:38.240 i got so much sauce i don't need no
00:23:40.720 sauce
00:23:41.279 on the word i need the word to be solid
00:23:43.440 food
00:23:44.400 that i can understand exactly what god
00:23:46.799 was saying to me through
00:23:48.799 the king james version do this you know
00:23:51.520 um
00:23:52.880 through this translation or the english
00:23:54.799 shannon version so pastor adams was
00:23:56.720 coming by
00:23:57.600 my spot uh i got this 300 acre spot in
00:24:00.880 um
00:24:01.279 calabasas uh that we had a little house
00:24:04.480 in that i was recording and i would play
00:24:07.760 this
00:24:08.240 music these chords that i love they're
00:24:10.000 almost like monk-like
00:24:11.840 um and that's going to go into something
00:24:13.440 we'll talk about later because i'm
00:24:14.880 building a modest i'm building them a
00:24:17.760 monastery that will
00:24:19.039 then be the future of uh monasteries
00:24:22.000 this like
00:24:22.799 uh full sustainable energy now
00:24:26.080 uh he says to me pastor adam says to me
00:24:29.360 when i was thinking about should i rap
00:24:30.880 or not he said my son
00:24:33.279 just said you know i wish i want to hear
00:24:35.440 yay rap do album about jesus a rap album
00:24:37.840 about jesus and it was
00:24:39.120 through the mouth of babes like this
00:24:41.840 person
00:24:42.320 i'm gonna listen to the kids bro you
00:24:44.159 know i'm gonna listen to my daughter
00:24:46.159 i'm gonna listen to kids before i listen
00:24:49.120 to
00:24:50.080 you know super programmed out adults
00:24:53.279 and especially if that adult hasn't done
00:24:55.919 something that
00:24:56.880 i am looking to do right uh so it's so
00:25:00.559 funny how people are so
00:25:01.679 like free and almost arrogant with their
00:25:03.760 advice and i'm just like
00:25:05.760 why would i listen to you you don't even
00:25:08.720 ask me for any advice i'm the most
00:25:10.400 successful person i know so
00:25:12.080 the um um
00:25:15.440 so he said my son wants to hear a rap
00:25:17.520 album from yay
00:25:19.200 and that just that was that was the
00:25:21.200 paradigm shift
00:25:22.480 for me i used that word a lot i like
00:25:24.400 that i like paradigm shift it's one of
00:25:26.080 my favorite
00:25:26.799 the and i i made this rap album
00:25:30.240 and you know for a lot of people it was
00:25:33.919 the first
00:25:34.880 album that they could play with a
00:25:36.400 certain production level
00:25:38.240 in the house with their with their with
00:25:40.960 their family
00:25:41.840 now you know you could argue if the
00:25:43.279 watch the throne production
00:25:45.919 was stronger or better than
00:25:49.200 uh jesus king production but when i go
00:25:52.880 and i like i've been working with dr dre
00:25:54.640 and some of the beats and just be like
00:25:55.760 you know
00:25:56.240 the hardest beats possible and it's
00:25:58.720 something that was very
00:26:00.240 spiritual and meditative about
00:26:03.440 the mix on jesus king that it wasn't
00:26:06.640 hitting as hard as jesus or hitting as
00:26:10.480 hard as uh
00:26:11.440 watch the throne it was like this is how
00:26:13.200 god wanted me to make this
00:26:16.000 uh make this sonic painting
00:26:19.120 and the way he wanted me to communicate
00:26:20.960 then so we did that album
00:26:22.640 and then we did the jesus's born album
00:26:25.679 which also i got that idea from pastor
00:26:27.279 adams
00:26:28.000 uh and
00:26:31.039 i mean there's people who that's the
00:26:33.520 only album they play
00:26:35.360 and it's just bringing these gospel and
00:26:37.760 i tell you like my formula for these
00:26:39.200 hymns i'm writing because i'm writing
00:26:41.760 the the songs that we're doing at uh
00:26:45.120 sunday service is basically my
00:26:48.559 book of hymns for the future gospel
00:26:52.000 university that i'm creating where
00:26:55.200 i've envisioned and will manifest
00:26:58.320 a 200 000 seat stadium
00:27:01.840 circular with a hundred thousand
00:27:05.039 gospel singers and people will go to
00:27:07.279 this university
00:27:08.720 and they will train the way you know a
00:27:12.240 russian olympic swimmer
00:27:13.520 you know a picture like they would be in
00:27:15.039 the pool six days a week at least
00:27:17.600 if not seven days but for people who
00:27:20.080 sing for the church or
00:27:21.760 you know uh you know because it's
00:27:25.600 it's it's a tide it's pro bonus all this
00:27:27.520 like people
00:27:28.640 don't practice that as much as we
00:27:31.760 practice
00:27:32.240 going to studio to rap or practice uh
00:27:35.120 playing basketball if we're in the nba
00:27:37.200 so it's making the nba sort of say
00:27:41.039 uh the coliseum for god and what that
00:27:44.399 have
00:27:44.640 have you like heard like soccer chants
00:27:47.440 and like
00:27:48.559 and just like sixty thousand persons so
00:27:51.360 i envisioned that
00:27:53.039 for god a hundred thousand people
00:27:56.159 sometimes singing in uh harmony
00:27:58.480 sometimes in
00:27:59.600 unison glory glory
00:28:03.440 oh god almighty we lift
00:28:06.960 our hands and give you
00:28:10.440 praise glory glory
00:28:14.559 oh god almighty we lift our
00:28:18.720 hands and give you praise
00:28:23.600 for picture a hundred thousand people
00:28:26.880 in unison and that feeling what that
00:28:28.799 would do for our spirits our souls it's
00:28:32.159 healing there's natural forms of healing
00:28:35.279 about
00:28:36.000 our environment um the friends
00:28:39.200 that we're around what we're wearing
00:28:41.360 what we're eating
00:28:42.640 our diet so donde is a design company
00:28:46.000 that um that uh
00:28:49.039 i formed around 10 years ago and
00:28:52.240 some of the people that worked at donda
00:28:54.159 are now have went on
00:28:55.600 to become heads of fashion houses like
00:28:57.840 uh virgil's the head of louis vuitton
00:28:59.760 and he was the head of donda
00:29:01.360 at a certain point another guy that
00:29:02.799 worked at donda is now the head of
00:29:04.720 givenchy
00:29:05.840 so this is like the the talent pool
00:29:09.039 and this donda is basically my version
00:29:11.279 of like a
00:29:12.080 cyber you know extension of my brain
00:29:15.200 like here's something that i'm thinking
00:29:17.120 of that you can't touch but we need to
00:29:19.600 we need to bring it into fruition we
00:29:21.279 need to manifest it
00:29:22.720 and we have to see how to use things of
00:29:25.919 our past
00:29:26.640 and things of our now to create our
00:29:28.240 future so it's a
00:29:30.640 organization um created to
00:29:35.120 guarantee the future of the human race
00:29:37.279 really i thought about even calling it
00:29:38.880 edna
00:29:39.440 because i see us all as superheroes and
00:29:41.200 aetna was the designer
00:29:43.120 in the incredibles which is kind of
00:29:45.600 almost really similar to donda i'm just
00:29:47.440 seeing these lineups and stuff
00:29:49.120 so um so now
00:29:53.120 our focus is food clothing shelter
00:29:55.840 communication education and
00:29:57.919 transportation so at the school that i
00:29:59.760 just created easy christian academy
00:30:01.919 you know we call nasa we call different
00:30:03.760 places about this hydroponic
00:30:05.840 vertical growing uh
00:30:09.600 garden and i remember sitting you know
00:30:12.480 the idea of the garden is
00:30:13.679 from a to z you have to be able to make
00:30:16.240 your food
00:30:17.039 right there fully sustainable right
00:30:18.720 there on your land and you know there's
00:30:20.480 a bunch of people like oh i made this
00:30:21.919 salad
00:30:22.480 right here it's like i'm not that good
00:30:24.880 enough
00:30:25.520 you still gotta go to the grocery store
00:30:27.760 for eighty percent
00:30:29.200 sixty percent of your stuff i remember
00:30:30.559 this one you know um
00:30:32.480 this one farmer we had you know he
00:30:35.200 wanted to build this
00:30:36.000 class for the kids and all this we're
00:30:38.240 going to show the kids this thing people
00:30:39.520 always make the kids version
00:30:40.720 i don't like this the kids version thing
00:30:42.799 like
00:30:43.760 kids need to understand how what if the
00:30:46.880 pandemic was
00:30:47.840 you know they lost all their parents and
00:30:49.279 it was lost the kids need to understand
00:30:51.520 early how real life works
00:30:54.559 so physics is one of the anchors of the
00:30:56.880 school that i'm
00:30:57.919 creating i remember you know i'm uh the
00:31:00.559 city is all self-sustaining so it works
00:31:02.240 off of our
00:31:03.120 four main resources earth wind
00:31:06.720 uh water and and fire and
00:31:10.320 uh 90 of it is running off of water with
00:31:13.279 like
00:31:13.840 aqueducts like the city of masada and i
00:31:16.399 was talking to this
00:31:17.360 engineer um and saying i need the whole
00:31:20.960 thing to run off of water
00:31:22.720 and he said well we're gonna have to use
00:31:24.399 solar power i said
00:31:26.399 i don't and please you know don't take
00:31:28.320 this as any offense
00:31:30.159 i don't like solar panels i feel that
00:31:32.480 they're part of still of what edison's
00:31:34.799 idea was i don't feel like they're
00:31:36.159 really in line with what nikolai tesla
00:31:38.640 really wanted to do with alternative
00:31:40.320 current i mean getting into the whole
00:31:42.640 tesla and what edison did to take tesla
00:31:44.960 down and
00:31:45.679 the fact the world would probably be
00:31:47.279 free by now if ted if tesla wasn't
00:31:49.840 basically destroyed by the media that
00:31:52.640 edison controlled in the propaganda that
00:31:54.559 edison control
00:31:55.679 so i'm i'm talking to my engineer and
00:31:58.640 saying this needs to run completely with
00:32:00.240 water and i don't want to use
00:32:02.080 uh a solar anyway and he says no i'm
00:32:04.320 saying we're going to use a mirror
00:32:06.320 and it's going to connect to a steam uh
00:32:08.640 engine and that's going to push the
00:32:10.159 water
00:32:10.960 back up and i was like after like
00:32:13.440 screaming at the guy i was like look if
00:32:15.360 i had known
00:32:16.000 physics i wouldn't have been screaming
00:32:18.159 at my engineer so if we think about
00:32:20.399 what we're learning in school to learn
00:32:22.640 physics
00:32:23.519 to learn farming i was uh i was talking
00:32:26.840 to
00:32:28.320 um a friend of mine that's a uh a rapper
00:32:31.679 and super
00:32:32.880 uh super uh god following spiritual
00:32:37.519 super smart
00:32:38.640 and i was showing her the um uh
00:32:42.799 uh some of the designs for uh the
00:32:45.840 monasteries and some of the designs for
00:32:47.679 the fully sustainable communities all
00:32:49.120 the same thing
00:32:50.000 and then it said bioengineering on it
00:32:52.080 and she said what do you
00:32:53.360 she it's like for her bioengineering has
00:32:55.679 a negative connotation
00:32:57.120 and my response was isn't like farming
00:32:59.679 and cooking
00:33:00.720 like bioengineering at the at the
00:33:03.519 simplest form like we went to
00:33:05.279 going from like grabbing apples off of a
00:33:07.120 tree to
00:33:08.799 oh we put this boom in the ground oh and
00:33:11.760 we could grow this and we could grow
00:33:12.880 this
00:33:13.440 you know we could grow this harvest
00:33:15.200 right here so it's
00:33:16.559 you know i want to just sim simplify and
00:33:19.200 round up the
00:33:20.080 the principle behind uh the donda way of
00:33:23.440 thinking
00:33:24.480 is we've got all this
00:33:27.760 information and all this you know these
00:33:30.720 science scientific um
00:33:34.080 uh exploration these things that tesla
00:33:37.360 never completed these things that
00:33:39.200 da vinci never completed and
00:33:43.360 we can look at all of these things and
00:33:44.880 see how do we create the most
00:33:46.960 primitive versions of this to create a
00:33:49.760 fully sustainable ecosystem which is
00:33:53.360 you know what covet actually helped us
00:33:55.440 to you know get closer to our families
00:33:57.519 get closer to our children
00:33:59.440 uh understand like oh wow that you know
00:34:02.240 that was mapped out for us to be
00:34:04.240 50 minutes away from our home and our
00:34:06.080 kids school to be 30 minutes away and to
00:34:08.560 put us in traffic for that amount of
00:34:10.159 time and
00:34:10.879 these cities have been designed to
00:34:13.679 promote
00:34:14.159 industry and just to make more money
00:34:16.159 they haven't been designed to promote
00:34:18.000 happiness so
00:34:18.960 we're at this paradigm shift in our
00:34:21.918 existence
00:34:22.960 you know it was when muhammad hit the
00:34:24.800 market i think that's who it was and
00:34:26.159 brought money because before it was
00:34:27.599 slave and trade
00:34:29.040 and this is something you know
00:34:31.760 dishonorable men
00:34:33.040 honor money i got this bar from dave
00:34:34.800 chappelle i'm not trying to like
00:34:36.159 steal his bar uh and you know
00:34:39.599 we as human beings this this race on
00:34:43.040 earth have like been honoring money
00:34:46.560 and you know money isn't it's not even
00:34:49.760 real you know it's not even backed by
00:34:51.199 anything i don't want to like go too
00:34:52.639 far into that but when you unprogram
00:34:55.440 yourself you see that there's
00:34:56.800 other forms of currency now like
00:34:58.960 relationships
00:35:00.240 are a more important currency than money
00:35:03.359 itself and that's what
00:35:04.720 we really saw it's like the end of the
00:35:06.320 movie that our existence would be
00:35:08.640 pre-coveted post covet and so as the
00:35:11.760 titanic
00:35:12.720 is crashing and sinking and rome is
00:35:14.880 falling
00:35:16.079 there's got to be this new civilization
00:35:18.560 like the end of tron where everything
00:35:20.320 starts to
00:35:21.359 light up and it's been under this like
00:35:23.280 dark cloud so
00:35:24.880 you know god is using me
00:35:28.000 and he has a calling you know in my life
00:35:30.560 to make the world better for
00:35:32.400 all people like people say there's bad
00:35:34.000 people there's good people no there's
00:35:35.920 there's there's people that are
00:35:37.760 possessed that have demonic ways
00:35:40.320 but we were all children at one time
00:35:42.720 they say some people no they were born
00:35:44.800 bad you got to remember like say oh
00:35:46.240 there's bad people even even the devil's
00:35:48.160 an angel
00:35:49.920 a fallen angel a lost angel like
00:35:53.920 los angeles if you think
00:35:57.280 let me but that's the city of angels let
00:35:59.920 me let me let me start
00:36:01.280 from the beginning so you you
00:36:02.640 essentially deconstruct things
00:36:05.119 so when you say in in many ways when
00:36:07.599 you're describing yourself as a
00:36:08.800 visionary this is
00:36:09.839 what i'm saying is you're looking at all
00:36:12.320 the systems that are in place whether
00:36:13.760 it's the
00:36:14.320 record industry um the contracts that
00:36:17.359 are
00:36:17.920 wrong with artists the way civilization
00:36:19.760 is set up i think visionaries too
00:36:21.680 glossy and too saucy of a title okay
00:36:24.720 whatever you're deconstructing
00:36:28.079 all of these things and you find flaws
00:36:30.000 in the systems
00:36:31.359 so all these systems whether it's the
00:36:33.119 the music industry system
00:36:34.720 whether it's the political system
00:36:36.320 whether it's the the system of
00:36:38.560 gathering food whether even a religious
00:36:40.640 system like i remember when
00:36:42.160 you started doing your sunday service
00:36:43.839 and my friend was like what is he doing
00:36:45.200 i go
00:36:46.400 he's making going to church cool again
00:36:48.560 like you don't think that's look at all
00:36:49.839 these people having a great time you've
00:36:51.520 thousands of people that are chanting
00:36:53.200 and singing along like he's not asking
00:36:55.440 for anything
00:36:56.560 i go look if anybody should be doing
00:36:59.359 something like that it's him
00:37:00.560 i go because he's making great music
00:37:02.560 everybody's having a good time
00:37:04.160 and what do you get out of that the best
00:37:05.680 thing that people ever get out of church
00:37:07.280 is sense of community a time where you
00:37:10.160 get together
00:37:11.119 and you all agree this is where you're
00:37:13.040 going to concentrate on good
00:37:14.240 you're going to concentrate on goodness
00:37:15.440 you're going to concentrate on on
00:37:17.440 and trying to find these shared values
00:37:19.760 that are going to help the community
00:37:21.119 now you're doing this in this mass form
00:37:23.359 you got the superstar
00:37:24.960 musician who's doing this in this mass
00:37:27.119 form with
00:37:28.079 thousands and thousands of people in
00:37:29.520 these gigantic areas like that's
00:37:31.359 nothing but positive so you
00:37:33.040 deconstructed the idea of
00:37:35.520 how how to do a religious service but
00:37:37.119 make it cool and now you're thinking
00:37:39.440 about deconstructing all these different
00:37:41.359 things
00:37:41.839 you're thinking about deconstructing how
00:37:43.920 how food is harvested
00:37:45.359 you're thinking about deconstructing how
00:37:47.200 we make energy you're literally trying
00:37:49.200 to
00:37:49.760 deconstruct and and reimagine the idea
00:37:52.800 of civilization
00:37:54.079 yeah exactly so talk me through how this
00:37:57.359 starts with you
00:37:58.880 have you were you always religious your
00:38:01.839 whole life
00:38:03.280 yes i was and then i you know then i hit
00:38:05.839 high school
00:38:06.470 [Laughter]
00:38:09.200 so but you you know when you're a young
00:38:11.920 man and you're
00:38:13.280 you know you're a superstar musician and
00:38:15.440 you know you're living a wild life what
00:38:18.480 what was it that led you back to this
00:38:20.720 just a feeling in your life
00:38:22.240 that there was more to life there was
00:38:25.119 more to your position
00:38:26.880 there was more to you know this idea of
00:38:29.040 a calling
00:38:29.920 that you felt like you could do more
00:38:33.040 and that it it resonated with you more
00:38:35.839 to
00:38:36.240 to to produce these sunday services
00:38:39.520 and to to start thinking of of life in
00:38:42.400 this way like you can improve
00:38:44.240 things yeah god knocked me off my horse
00:38:46.800 god like
00:38:48.000 literally called me and said okay
00:38:51.440 now i need you i need you right now i
00:38:54.160 need
00:38:54.560 i mean not that god needs needs me we
00:38:57.200 need god but
00:38:58.480 he called me to serve him and
00:39:01.760 i was tired of serving the music
00:39:03.680 industry to start
00:39:05.280 tired of serving you know filling up
00:39:08.320 stadiums
00:39:09.599 uh you know when the last concert
00:39:13.119 last tour i did we had a floating stage
00:39:16.160 and uh and actually it was a hanging
00:39:18.880 stage but
00:39:20.160 it looked like it was floating and
00:39:22.000 that's just another thing that's
00:39:23.119 illusion where we need to dispel the
00:39:24.720 illusion i wouldn't even call it the
00:39:25.920 floating stage today but
00:39:27.040 the whole thing about is people used to
00:39:28.640 say how i would lose money on tours
00:39:30.560 because i would put so much into the
00:39:31.839 creative
00:39:32.720 and i and i was like wanted to prove but
00:39:35.040 prove to who you know prove to man
00:39:37.280 prove to greedy people you know that i
00:39:39.520 could make more
00:39:40.800 than anybody and that's like the
00:39:42.480 gladiator position that all
00:39:44.160 artists are put into like we're in the
00:39:46.000 middle of this coliseum
00:39:47.359 let me show you i can kill more lions
00:39:49.359 and tigers and bears and people and blah
00:39:51.520 blah
00:39:52.160 than any other gladiators that happen so
00:39:54.160 that's what i'm that's what i was doing
00:39:56.320 and then i remember talking to james
00:39:58.480 terrell and i was like
00:40:00.400 at the top of my lungs like screaming
00:40:02.240 about saving
00:40:04.079 uh saving ourselves and humanity and the
00:40:06.880 reason why me and james needed to
00:40:09.040 uh connect and then i went to uh
00:40:12.560 my show and then it's like my like this
00:40:15.920 like my head popped back and the spirit
00:40:18.400 jumped out and it felt like it was like
00:40:19.680 my mom
00:40:20.319 talking and the last thing i said was
00:40:23.280 this thing is
00:40:24.079 over and i'm saying it like i sound like
00:40:27.839 my mom like donda like that's something
00:40:30.319 she would have said
00:40:31.680 if she was in the physical form when she
00:40:34.960 sees
00:40:35.680 her son you know exhausted like i just
00:40:38.640 went through uh
00:40:40.079 uh i had this uh fashion show we had
00:40:42.960 this fashion show where we took over msg
00:40:45.440 and just broke all boundaries sold 20
00:40:47.839 000 16
00:40:48.480 000 seats and played the new album and
00:40:51.440 uh
00:40:52.720 it was you know a thousand black people
00:40:55.440 in the show
00:40:56.160 and yeah like all young thug plugging in
00:40:59.280 the iphone and
00:41:00.880 uh travis and cuddy dancing he had 50
00:41:04.319 cent there
00:41:04.960 jay-z there lamar odom the uh the first
00:41:08.160 time that people
00:41:09.359 you know saw him and walk again
00:41:12.480 uh was we walked together into the
00:41:16.000 into the stadium uh and he's camo yeezy
00:41:19.599 jacket
00:41:20.480 all head to toe and the reason why that
00:41:22.319 was so important is like when he was in
00:41:23.839 a coma
00:41:24.560 i would come by and play him the new
00:41:26.720 music
00:41:27.599 and once he was out of the coma he said
00:41:29.520 that he remembered that music when he
00:41:32.000 was in a coma and that was the album i
00:41:33.760 was
00:41:34.000 playing that day so that's the reason
00:41:36.640 why me and lamar
00:41:38.000 uh walked in together and then
00:41:41.680 the next a few months later i did a
00:41:43.760 fashion show and it started 45 minutes
00:41:45.839 late
00:41:46.720 and the media they just killed me
00:41:49.760 they lebrond me as i would say like when
00:41:51.599 lebron went to uh
00:41:53.680 to um uh miami and they said you know
00:41:57.359 who are you to have a
00:41:58.480 a choice you know like what uh one of my
00:42:02.160 other heroes tom brady he he left i
00:42:04.800 didn't see no
00:42:05.839 jerseys getting burned like when lebron
00:42:09.760 uh left so then less than a week after
00:42:13.280 that
00:42:14.160 my wife is robbed in
00:42:17.440 paris and so we we just because i'm i'm
00:42:21.280 in the middle of a tour while i'm doing
00:42:22.720 the fashion show while i'm doing this
00:42:24.400 so we cancel the tour because it's it's
00:42:27.119 very you know traumatic
00:42:29.040 and then you know
00:42:32.079 we start the tour back up and we get
00:42:34.800 back into it
00:42:36.000 and then i i just keep on saying i want
00:42:38.079 to go to japan
00:42:39.119 i just want to go to japan because japan
00:42:41.119 is like a way that people treat there
00:42:43.440 isn't like the systemic racism
00:42:46.160 embedded in every single individual
00:42:48.880 that's
00:42:49.280 inside of the place like in america uh
00:42:51.680 black white
00:42:52.560 anything there's a systemic uh white
00:42:56.160 white supremacy like when i tag you know
00:42:59.440 white supremacy or we say this it's like
00:43:02.240 the
00:43:02.640 um yes that is america that is the world
00:43:06.000 currently we've been taught that my
00:43:07.520 first superhero was
00:43:09.040 superman you know and my dad was a black
00:43:12.560 panther
00:43:13.680 but you know when disney makes black
00:43:16.319 panther
00:43:17.119 now when you look it up you don't see my
00:43:19.760 dad
00:43:20.640 protecting his neighborhood or snatching
00:43:23.839 a mic out of somebody's hand while
00:43:25.200 they're lying
00:43:26.079 i don't know you know like father like
00:43:28.240 son right there
00:43:29.200 uh but you see this character
00:43:33.520 that's made for black people to idolize
00:43:36.319 that was designed by a white
00:43:37.920 white person and put out by a white
00:43:39.599 company so it's controlling the
00:43:41.599 narrative to say
00:43:43.040 we're going to show you harriet tubman
00:43:45.040 we're not going to show you
00:43:46.560 not turner and they do it every chance
00:43:49.680 they get
00:43:50.240 maleficent uh um
00:43:53.520 they called her her race of people the
00:43:55.680 moors
00:43:56.880 and the moors are and i just saw it
00:43:59.920 again i was just like yo
00:44:02.160 if you erase our history like most black
00:44:05.200 people we don't know
00:44:06.640 or we come we think we came from slaves
00:44:08.800 we don't know
00:44:09.920 our bloodline and we're we're given
00:44:13.040 black history month and we
00:44:14.560 take that like it's some gift to us no
00:44:16.960 it's a programming
00:44:18.400 to us racism doesn't end until we
00:44:22.000 get to a point where we stop having to
00:44:23.760 put the word black in front of it
00:44:26.000 because it's like we're we're putting
00:44:28.160 the rim a little bit lower
00:44:30.000 for ourselves like it's when i say i'm
00:44:32.800 the second
00:44:33.920 wealthiest black man in america
00:44:37.119 like why do i have to say that because
00:44:38.640 you know obviously
00:44:40.400 if we just go on wealth period of what
00:44:42.960 we call wealth like financial wealth
00:44:44.480 that score
00:44:45.200 card you know i'd be like i'm the i'm
00:44:48.319 the 78th
00:44:49.680 wealthiest man in america but we
00:44:52.400 shouldn't have to
00:44:53.680 have a special box a special month
00:44:56.560 because also what they show in black
00:44:58.319 black history month is us getting hosed
00:45:01.119 down
00:45:02.000 reminding us that we were slaves like
00:45:04.319 what if we had
00:45:05.119 remember when i cheated on you month
00:45:07.200 like remember when you first found the
00:45:09.440 found the text messages remember how
00:45:11.760 does that make you feel it makes you
00:45:13.359 feel
00:45:14.160 depleted and defeated you know it's
00:45:17.599 no matter what religion you are what we
00:45:18.960 can agree on is it is always
00:45:21.119 now but now is the shortest moment of
00:45:24.400 our life
00:45:26.079 it's gone in an instant the longest
00:45:28.319 moments of our life
00:45:29.359 are our memories and our imaginations
00:45:32.960 think about how long a kid imagines
00:45:34.560 christmas before
00:45:36.560 i mean versus how long christmas really
00:45:38.640 is and when you think back to your
00:45:39.920 christmas
00:45:40.400 are you under the table like jim carrey
00:45:42.800 and eternal sunshine with a spotless
00:45:44.240 mind like under a chair or are you a
00:45:45.680 giant
00:45:46.480 are you a king are you what blac
00:45:49.599 what what black history month has told
00:45:51.920 you you are and this is me
00:45:53.839 speaking to uh you know black people
00:45:57.839 specifically in america that
00:46:01.440 you know i know people who would you
00:46:03.200 know kill someone
00:46:05.119 in uh or have a gunner
00:46:08.800 you know in in their own hood and be
00:46:11.280 afraid to go
00:46:12.560 downtown and literally be like afraid of
00:46:15.440 white people
00:46:16.640 like the most gangster gang of gangsters
00:46:19.760 wouldn't go downtown
00:46:21.680 and that's just a programming but that
00:46:24.079 program is inside of the curriculum
00:46:26.079 it's an instant side of the media it and
00:46:28.720 it and it goes to
00:46:30.400 this whole idea of yay when people say
00:46:33.599 is jay crazy
00:46:35.119 is a a narcissistic is a
00:46:38.160 uh egomaniac is yay self-absorbed of jay
00:46:41.520 all these
00:46:42.160 no yay know who yay is i know who i am
00:46:46.079 and i'm not fin i'm not fit to
00:46:49.359 bow to uh
00:46:52.480 to an idea that you want to have of me i
00:46:56.560 am going to be the full idea that god
00:47:00.480 has of me and when i do things that are
00:47:03.599 that god don't like
00:47:05.359 i'm i'm i'm i'm being the lesser version
00:47:09.280 of me this is where i
00:47:10.640 you know in my weakness god becomes
00:47:13.359 strong
00:47:14.240 i have to be the higher me
00:47:17.520 when when people are downing me it's not
00:47:20.960 like
00:47:21.520 me fighting fire with fire me attacking
00:47:24.240 or as you say like
00:47:25.680 you know stooping to uh
00:47:30.000 stooping to that level it's like the
00:47:31.760 devil will use
00:47:34.000 you against you you become your own
00:47:37.440 uh you become your own worst enemy and i
00:47:40.319 just went on a riff right there but
00:47:42.079 the thing is these isn't that what you
00:47:44.559 do though like yeah
00:47:45.839 yeah one of the things that i when
00:47:47.920 anybody ever talks about you to me
00:47:50.079 they they they say well he's all over
00:47:52.640 the place
00:47:53.520 and i say i think that he's got a
00:47:54.960 different power source like if you look
00:47:57.119 at the way
00:47:58.079 everybody interfaces with the world if
00:47:59.760 there's a universal power most people
00:48:01.440 have like a 20 watt charger
00:48:03.119 the way i describe you i say i think
00:48:04.559 that [ __ ] got like 150 watt
00:48:06.400 charger
00:48:06.960 and these ideas are just coming at them
00:48:08.800 so you do
00:48:10.000 go on these rants that sometimes need to
00:48:12.480 be dissected into individual things
00:48:15.040 but overall you're incredibly productive
00:48:18.800 so my question is why do you
00:48:22.000 why do people think there's something
00:48:23.440 wrong with you yeah this is but
00:48:26.160 legitimately like you've been medicated
00:48:28.160 they've they've
00:48:29.280 put you away right they've brought to
00:48:31.280 you how did that happen
00:48:33.200 well i'll say these two things i think
00:48:37.839 uh very three-dimensionally i don't
00:48:40.880 think
00:48:41.280 in the black and white lines that i've
00:48:43.520 been programmed
00:48:44.400 to think in and i and i think in full
00:48:46.800 color
00:48:47.520 so when i talk i have to describe
00:48:50.559 a thought in five ways
00:48:53.680 you know we we enjoy food that has
00:48:56.880 multiple seasoning in it we enjoy music
00:48:59.280 that has multiple instruments
00:49:01.040 so when i talk it's not a rant
00:49:04.160 it's a symphony of ideas and
00:49:07.200 when you collect them you say oh these
00:49:09.040 are all these things that connect
00:49:10.640 yeah you know i i
00:49:13.680 i just tell the truth and telling the
00:49:15.760 truth
00:49:16.720 is crazy in a world full of lies
00:49:20.400 that's simply it but none of the things
00:49:22.000 you're saying are crazy another things
00:49:23.839 you said are crazy
00:49:25.280 it's fascinating the way you think
00:49:27.839 because
00:49:28.319 i can see that you're thinking in all
00:49:30.000 these different layers and you're
00:49:31.200 looking at things from all these
00:49:32.480 different perspectives
00:49:33.680 and they all come together out of your
00:49:35.119 mouth in like a tornado of ideas
00:49:37.839 now if someone wants to just have a
00:49:39.359 conversation with you back and forth i
00:49:41.119 could see whether you go this guy's
00:49:42.319 crazy just doesn't stop he's ranting
00:49:44.319 but what i'm seeing is just you're a
00:49:46.480 very thorough thinker
00:49:48.319 you're thinking at things independently
00:49:51.520 but you're thinking of things in a
00:49:53.440 massive perspective
00:49:55.119 now who convinced you that that's bad is
00:49:57.520 it have you
00:49:58.559 always been this way or were you
00:50:01.680 less is it was it less manageable before
00:50:04.000 did you have issues with it before
00:50:06.160 yeah i believe before i
00:50:09.839 found christ and gave my life to god
00:50:13.839 i would try to lean on my own
00:50:15.760 understanding and that's
00:50:17.440 the universe is
00:50:20.720 like a black hole of information what do
00:50:23.280 you mean by your own understanding
00:50:24.960 meaning when people ask einstein said
00:50:27.920 you're the smartest person what would
00:50:29.359 you like to know
00:50:30.640 he his einstein's response was i'd like
00:50:33.280 to understand the mind of god
00:50:35.440 meaning meaning god is all-knowing and
00:50:38.880 we can only know or see and for me as a
00:50:41.119 visionary
00:50:41.920 we can only know or see what god allows
00:50:44.880 us to see and what he
00:50:46.240 feels we're ready to see and understand
00:50:49.359 to to maximize what our mass laws
00:50:52.880 hierarchy and e chart is you know what
00:50:55.119 sets our dopa means what sets our
00:50:56.720 serotonins off
00:50:57.760 what makes us feel good basically like
00:51:00.079 you know we we did a good deed
00:51:02.480 and it's like it was somehow where you
00:51:04.480 know you know just doing a beat
00:51:06.839 for a famous per or just doing a beat
00:51:09.440 for
00:51:09.839 um a local dope rapper
00:51:12.880 really meant a lot to me when i was 14
00:51:15.040 years old
00:51:15.920 doing a beat for just anyone famous that
00:51:18.640 had a major
00:51:19.599 record deal was a lot to me at age 19.
00:51:22.800 me being able to you know put out my own
00:51:25.760 music and put my
00:51:26.800 own i was a lot to me at age 24 meaning
00:51:30.000 as i grow god sets
00:51:33.200 new stages in the game of life for me
00:51:35.760 that you get your
00:51:36.800 satisfaction like maslow's hierarchy of
00:51:39.200 need is like
00:51:40.000 our satisfaction chart what makes us
00:51:42.319 feel whole
00:51:43.599 and uh accomplished as a as a
00:51:46.720 as a human being so as i go through
00:51:48.800 these different levels there's times
00:51:50.960 where
00:51:51.920 i would use confidence when i knew what
00:51:54.319 i was doing
00:51:55.119 and i would use arrogance when i didn't
00:51:57.280 know what i was doing but i'd rather use
00:51:58.880 arrogance than to let someone
00:52:02.000 diminish my idea of myself because that
00:52:05.200 is what keeps us going hope actually
00:52:07.200 keeps us alive
00:52:08.480 anybody you ask most people is like do
00:52:10.160 you want tomorrow to come and they say
00:52:12.079 yes they have they have hope for it but
00:52:14.480 i went from having
00:52:15.599 confidence and arrogance to having faith
00:52:18.079 and faith
00:52:18.800 is the opposite of fear and that created
00:52:21.440 this
00:52:22.240 fearless approach that i have and that's
00:52:24.800 what
00:52:25.280 made now has made me the fearless leader
00:52:28.960 that i am that i've like crystallized
00:52:31.760 into
00:52:32.640 the leader that my mom always knew i
00:52:35.920 would be
00:52:36.720 when kids followed me in preschool the
00:52:39.280 leader
00:52:40.000 that people saw when we changed the
00:52:42.319 sound of music the leader
00:52:43.839 when we changed uh the the sneaker
00:52:46.960 industry the leader
00:52:48.160 and what we're doing with uh with
00:52:50.160 farming and with with shelters
00:52:52.160 when i was building you know the
00:52:53.680 homeless shelters uh
00:52:55.280 a couple years ago and visiting parks
00:52:58.319 and and then going to skip row and
00:53:00.480 understanding the uh uh the
00:53:03.760 dynamics and empathizing with what
00:53:06.240 actual
00:53:07.040 mental health issues are not someone
00:53:10.559 you know telling their truth or being
00:53:13.839 exhausted
00:53:14.640 and then being labeled as such like
00:53:17.760 i am so that's what you felt happened to
00:53:20.079 you like you were
00:53:21.040 absolutely truth and you were exhausted
00:53:22.720 and they labeled you as mentally
00:53:24.400 unhealthy
00:53:25.440 yes absolutely am i saying this right
00:53:27.280 that what happened with you
00:53:28.720 is you feel like maybe
00:53:32.000 or you probably feel like that having
00:53:34.800 this
00:53:35.280 higher calling and recognizing this
00:53:37.680 higher power
00:53:39.359 was the the glue that kept your thoughts
00:53:42.559 together they kept your mind straight
00:53:45.040 and it kept you on a righteous path
00:53:48.880 so instead of being scattered with all
00:53:51.440 these crazy thoughts and being exhausted
00:53:53.520 and
00:53:54.000 being labeled manic right like we talked
00:53:56.880 before
00:53:57.440 and you were saying that they had you on
00:53:58.960 medication but the medication [ __ ]
00:54:00.480 with your creativity
00:54:02.000 it [ __ ] with all kinds of things or it
00:54:04.400 blocked my ability to channel
00:54:06.480 what god wanted me to do but we're all
00:54:09.040 we're all on medication right now did
00:54:10.720 you use
00:54:11.359 toothpaste with fluoride today it blocks
00:54:13.200 your pineal gland and they put
00:54:15.119 children on it and we put we put our
00:54:17.599 kids on it you know we
00:54:19.280 it's inside the the deodorants that we
00:54:21.520 use is all these things to
00:54:23.359 create like a disconnect to god to serve
00:54:26.720 that
00:54:27.040 it's like are you serving man are you
00:54:30.000 serving
00:54:30.960 the the one and only master but what did
00:54:32.960 they tell you
00:54:34.000 when when they said that they were going
00:54:35.680 to put you on medication what do they
00:54:37.119 put you on
00:54:38.000 and what did they tell you one of my
00:54:39.599 favorite things that they did is they
00:54:40.960 put me on this medication
00:54:42.799 that made me uh gain a lot of weight and
00:54:45.839 i said i'm not gonna take this
00:54:47.520 and they said okay we got a medication
00:54:49.280 you could take but you won't gain weight
00:54:51.200 and this shows you they were trying to
00:54:53.119 kill a superhero
00:54:55.040 slowly trying to kill genius trying to
00:54:58.559 make me not feel like i could run for
00:55:00.960 president make me not feel like i can go
00:55:03.599 uh be born in atlanta grow up on the
00:55:06.640 south side of chicago
00:55:08.000 go into music go and win all these
00:55:10.640 grammys
00:55:11.520 change the sound of music and the look
00:55:13.440 of stage performances
00:55:15.200 all that and then still end up in 53
00:55:18.640 million dollars in debt what music
00:55:20.160 industry has people going to the exact
00:55:21.839 debt of the house that they think
00:55:23.760 they're gonna buy
00:55:25.040 after the tour is over and it's and it's
00:55:27.680 it's strategized there's criminals
00:55:29.520 all over everyone's almost
00:55:32.799 accounts in the music industry it's not
00:55:34.960 a safe place it's a
00:55:36.319 it's a treacherous place so filled with
00:55:38.319 money soon as things are filled with
00:55:40.000 money they're filled with people that
00:55:41.040 are trying to take advantage of other
00:55:42.400 people
00:55:42.799 it's filled with money bees come to
00:55:44.079 honey exactly exactly
00:55:46.799 so they put they put you on this ship
00:55:49.760 because you were exhausted
00:55:51.280 what did they put you on um
00:55:56.400 um you know i'm i can i can research
00:55:59.680 i'm actually forgetting the exact
00:56:03.119 medication
00:56:03.920 that they had um but what did it do uh
00:56:07.119 you
00:56:07.440 the main thing that it did is
00:56:13.680 it destroyed my confidence it made me
00:56:17.599 this shell of who i really am
00:56:20.799 it like grayed over my eyes
00:56:24.480 it it it made me
00:56:27.520 it made the mustang that buck anymore
00:56:30.079 hmm
00:56:32.400 they sedated you yes yeah and
00:56:36.079 they what was the the thought process
00:56:38.880 behind it when you talked to a doctor
00:56:40.880 about this
00:56:41.760 what did they tell you was wrong with
00:56:43.200 you
00:56:45.040 uh they they told me i was bipolar
00:56:48.720 and i remember going on tmz and saying
00:56:52.079 you know slavery is a choice and they
00:56:54.799 medicated
00:56:55.760 me for saying that for having that
00:56:58.640 opinion
00:56:59.359 and saying it out loud but as i put
00:57:02.319 those contracts up i'm saying
00:57:04.400 this is a choice as i you know
00:57:08.720 you didn't mean people being abducted
00:57:10.960 and brought into slavery and
00:57:12.880 put into chains was a choice what you
00:57:15.200 were talking about is
00:57:16.559 people making decisions that would
00:57:18.400 enslave them financially
00:57:20.000 and enslave their life yeah it was taken
00:57:22.240 out of context
00:57:23.680 and it was taken in the least charitable
00:57:26.799 way
00:57:27.359 and they decided to try to say look at
00:57:29.839 crazy kanye look at this [ __ ] he's
00:57:31.440 saying
00:57:32.240 and then they medicate you yes
00:57:35.280 and the media has always taken anything
00:57:37.680 out of context that isn't a part of
00:57:40.799 the overall narrative yeah that
00:57:44.000 because there's you know like hollywood
00:57:47.040 and media
00:57:47.839 has controlled so much of the narrative
00:57:50.079 and then
00:57:51.760 he had silicon valley and that's what's
00:57:53.839 so beautiful about
00:57:54.880 one of my heroes steve jobs because
00:57:56.559 there wouldn't be
00:57:58.000 a silicon valley or the silicon valley
00:58:00.160 wouldn't be
00:58:01.040 what it is today if steve jobs didn't
00:58:04.240 make
00:58:05.599 information accessible like this which
00:58:08.400 is still
00:58:09.680 a bit controlled but it feels like
00:58:12.960 twitter is the
00:58:16.880 the safest fleet freest uh
00:58:20.400 mass platform to communicate on
00:58:24.400 and you know it's like they mess with
00:58:26.559 jack because of that you know you know
00:58:29.040 well it's it's still censored there's a
00:58:30.960 lot of issues now but i think that's
00:58:32.400 internal i think that's people that are
00:58:33.839 working there that are woke that want to
00:58:35.680 stop people from saying certain things
00:58:38.000 and there's a lot of struggles with that
00:58:39.920 today
00:58:40.319 and i it's unfortunate because i i do
00:58:43.680 agree that it's an
00:58:44.799 unbelievable way to get ideas out there
00:58:47.200 yeah so
00:58:48.079 but it's also it's a new thing and it's
00:58:50.720 mismanaged by the people that use it
00:58:52.720 often
00:58:53.359 they don't know what they're doing or
00:58:54.480 why they're doing it every version of
00:58:56.640 anything that man
00:58:58.319 has made will be flawed sure and it has
00:59:00.960 to go through a bunch of different
00:59:03.040 steps of evolution it has to it has to
00:59:05.359 evolve and change
00:59:06.880 so why did you agree to let them do this
00:59:09.760 to you why did you agree to let them
00:59:11.680 medicate you
00:59:16.079 because if that is that look i'm crazy
00:59:18.720 for sure
00:59:19.520 but if someone came to me and go hey
00:59:20.799 we're going to put you on some
00:59:21.520 medication that medication is going to
00:59:22.960 calm you down i'd be like
00:59:26.880 everything i do is because i'm not calm
00:59:29.839 everything that i've ever done that's
00:59:31.200 made me successful
00:59:32.319 is because i have more energy it's
00:59:34.240 because i i have a wildness
00:59:36.880 like i'm not calming that down like i
00:59:38.559 know how to calm myself down
00:59:40.079 i can self-medicate with exercise and
00:59:41.760 meditation and
00:59:43.200 marijuana and a bunch of different
00:59:44.400 things but i'm not gonna i'm not gonna
00:59:46.400 take some medication that removes
00:59:48.799 anything that's unique with you
00:59:52.160 and all these wild ideas that come to
00:59:54.160 your head like very few people could
00:59:55.680 string together these thoughts the way
00:59:57.040 you're
00:59:57.440 describing them today if somebody asked
00:59:59.440 me if there's anything wrong with him
01:00:00.960 he's [ __ ] he's filled with awesome
01:00:03.119 like what's what's wrong with that if
01:00:04.559 you can keep that together what you just
01:00:06.480 did the way you just described
01:00:08.319 reimagining civilization reimagining
01:00:10.480 church reimagining
01:00:11.760 the food supplies there's nothing bad
01:00:14.000 about that
01:00:14.880 this is all very interesting and very
01:00:16.960 good like i would never say that's bad
01:00:19.760 but are you this way all the time or is
01:00:22.160 there good
01:00:22.799 versions of kanye and versions of kanye
01:00:25.280 where you don't feel like you have a
01:00:26.559 grip on
01:00:27.359 these thoughts you know what i love is
01:00:29.920 there was
01:00:30.640 uh some perspectives that people
01:00:35.280 showed about what a true
01:00:39.760 manic episode really looks like after i
01:00:42.000 was in south carolina
01:00:43.599 and this one guy was talking about his
01:00:47.119 mom being in an episode and kidnapping
01:00:50.480 his brother
01:00:51.839 and you know like proper extreme
01:00:55.280 cases you know i
01:00:58.880 cried and was gut
01:01:02.400 wrenched like at the
01:01:05.680 i don't even like to say out loud what i
01:01:08.400 s
01:01:08.720 what i said on south carolina but the
01:01:11.520 idea
01:01:12.319 of you know i'm just
01:01:15.599 trying to word it in a way that's really
01:01:17.680 safe and covers my family
01:01:19.680 um
01:01:23.440 people saw this clip of me crying some
01:01:25.920 people didn't know
01:01:26.799 what i was crying about but i was crying
01:01:29.599 about
01:01:31.760 that there was a a possible chance
01:01:35.280 you know i'm just i'm looking at a way
01:01:36.799 to say this
01:01:38.799 that there was a chance that
01:01:43.599 you know that we didn't make that kim
01:01:46.400 and i didn't make the family we have
01:01:47.760 today
01:01:48.799 that's much that's my most like uh
01:01:52.640 family friendly you know way to word
01:01:54.960 that
01:01:55.680 and just the idea of it just tears me up
01:01:59.039 inside that i was a part of a culture
01:02:01.920 that promotes this kind of thing like
01:02:05.280 one of the uh major statistics
01:02:08.880 on the subject of life is
01:02:12.720 um that the greatest
01:02:16.319 advocates for um
01:02:20.240 the a the a word is
01:02:23.839 are men from ages 31 to 37
01:02:27.920 and that's how old i was and
01:02:31.359 i felt like i was too busy my dad felt
01:02:34.480 like
01:02:35.280 he was too busy for me and
01:02:38.799 we have a culture of that and
01:02:42.240 they have a child rebel soldiers
01:02:46.400 that were in africa that would be doped
01:02:49.280 up
01:02:50.400 and psyched out and made to kill their
01:02:53.680 parents
01:02:54.640 were well in our culture we're doped up
01:02:57.359 and psyched out
01:02:58.559 and made to kill our children you know
01:03:01.760 we have to decouple the conversation of
01:03:04.960 uh planned parenthood and
01:03:08.960 woman's choice now so of course i'm
01:03:11.920 christian so i'm
01:03:13.359 pro-life um
01:03:16.720 and when i go into office i'm not
01:03:21.200 changing laws because i realize we live
01:03:23.839 in an
01:03:24.240 imperfect world in an imperfect society
01:03:27.119 what i will be presenting is a plan a
01:03:29.440 and we've already started to work on
01:03:31.039 plan a to change the
01:03:32.720 connotation of orphanages to change the
01:03:34.799 connotation of foster care
01:03:36.319 and not just change the connotation you
01:03:38.720 know verbally
01:03:39.920 but to create places that are to the
01:03:42.720 level of like the amman geary and disney
01:03:45.119 world how to had a kid
01:03:47.039 you know what is this like and we have
01:03:48.960 so much land
01:03:50.480 that this can be created and then spread
01:03:52.799 across
01:03:53.680 the world to orphanages in africa and in
01:03:57.119 china and just
01:03:58.559 um uh across the globe to
01:04:01.599 to create these environments that when
01:04:04.319 there's expecting families moms and
01:04:06.559 fathers
01:04:07.280 that they feel like there's a place even
01:04:09.839 if
01:04:10.559 they don't feel well off enough to bring
01:04:13.039 another life into this world that
01:04:14.480 there's a place to go there's a plan a
01:04:17.440 because plan b and planned parenthood
01:04:20.880 were planned
01:04:21.839 by a eugenics that set out and said
01:04:24.960 out loud i'm doing this to
01:04:28.079 kill the black race and to create
01:04:30.799 population control
01:04:32.400 you know if we what are you saying plan
01:04:35.599 b mean the pill meaning the
01:04:38.839 the morning-after pill you know what let
01:04:41.520 me planned parenthood let me let me let
01:04:43.440 me decouple those things let me
01:04:44.960 let me talk about planned parenthood
01:04:46.720 okay
01:04:48.799 there's the last figure i saw is there
01:04:51.599 were 210
01:04:52.880 000 deaths due to covet
01:04:56.319 in america and everywhere you go you see
01:04:59.599 someone with a mask on
01:05:03.119 with a the a word
01:05:06.559 a culture i'll say it one time with
01:05:10.400 abortion culture
01:05:13.280 there are 1 000
01:05:16.559 black children aborted
01:05:20.480 a day daily we are in genocide
01:05:25.760 we so more black children
01:05:29.839 have died in the past
01:05:33.039 since february than people have died
01:05:36.160 of covet and everyone wears a mask
01:05:39.520 so it's a matter of where are we turning
01:05:42.480 a blind's eye to
01:05:44.000 like the media can control a lot of
01:05:46.559 times it has to control what we care
01:05:48.079 about
01:05:48.720 i even heard somebody say at one point
01:05:51.520 this is the actual sentence i heard
01:05:52.799 someone say puerto rico so played out
01:05:55.599 meaning there was a time where people
01:05:57.119 were caring about it and now the media
01:05:59.200 says don't care about it but these
01:06:00.640 people
01:06:01.599 it still hasn't been solved the the
01:06:03.680 hurricane's still
01:06:04.720 hit the earthquakes still hidden people
01:06:06.480 are still suffering from that
01:06:07.839 and no one has really gone to fix it and
01:06:10.720 when that 11 billion
01:06:12.240 goes to haiti and it doesn't get to the
01:06:13.920 people
01:06:16.079 you know the daily mail post a
01:06:19.839 a swimsuit pick or something and uh
01:06:23.359 deters our energy to what we have to do
01:06:27.119 collectively to
01:06:29.359 to to to help our brothers and sisters
01:06:32.480 you know i look at
01:06:33.760 society as as one body
01:06:36.880 i want to just go into this rift because
01:06:39.359 my thoughts are like
01:06:40.640 these clouds and mario brothers and i'll
01:06:42.400 jump to this and i'll see another one
01:06:43.599 i'll jump to another and say oh yes i
01:06:45.359 jump to another
01:06:46.160 i need to express this uh this story
01:06:49.839 i believe that you know
01:06:53.039 love will heal all and
01:06:56.319 we have to look at i believe i believe
01:06:59.440 that world peace is possible
01:07:01.119 and i believe it's us looking
01:07:04.160 at each other as a moment in time
01:07:08.960 time is love you love the things you put
01:07:12.240 time into that's where i'm in time is
01:07:13.839 love like because this is like
01:07:16.400 uh this intangible thing this thing you
01:07:18.160 can't grab you can't just grab time in
01:07:19.680 your hand you can't grab love in your
01:07:20.960 hand but
01:07:22.079 but we feel both of these things are
01:07:23.520 real for us to love one another just as
01:07:26.480 simple as that like
01:07:27.599 love will heal the world this is
01:07:30.880 what it's gonna take to heal the world
01:07:34.559 but we have a competitive spirit we like
01:07:37.280 having a bad guy we like having a
01:07:38.960 competitor
01:07:39.839 so what we need to do is change the bad
01:07:43.359 guy change the competitor
01:07:44.799 make the competitor be the roman era the
01:07:48.640 roman civilization
01:07:49.760 make the uh competitive be the
01:07:53.680 egyptian kingdom and say we are the
01:07:57.200 first society
01:07:58.240 we're the first civilization that
01:08:01.359 ever became civil because we are still
01:08:04.559 just as much in the dark ages
01:08:07.920 as medieval times or as game of thrones
01:08:11.599 you know level uh black mirror
01:08:14.720 level i i know i went past future other
01:08:17.359 dimension for a second
01:08:18.799 but we kill each other we kill each
01:08:20.799 other on
01:08:22.399 social media we kill each other in high
01:08:24.799 schools
01:08:25.679 like in the way with that we talk to
01:08:27.520 each other we
01:08:28.880 we physically kill each other in our own
01:08:31.040 neighborhoods and
01:08:32.238 outside of neighborhoods you know this
01:08:35.439 planet
01:08:36.080 when we when we keep turning a blind's
01:08:38.479 eye
01:08:39.120 to our brothers and our sisters and our
01:08:43.120 family which is
01:08:44.000 us as a whole as all of humanity then
01:08:47.040 of course it's going to get to the point
01:08:48.799 where
01:08:50.080 there's you know homeless sleeping under
01:08:54.399 you know a um a bridge in calabasas
01:08:57.839 because we ignored the homeless person
01:09:00.399 sleeping in front of the gucci store
01:09:02.960 how do you how does just look at that
01:09:05.600 visual
01:09:06.158 it's a homeless person sleeping in front
01:09:09.040 of the gucci store
01:09:10.479 we have builders we have people who know
01:09:13.839 how to make
01:09:14.880 communities we have people who know how
01:09:16.479 to cook and how to make food
01:09:18.479 and how to um
01:09:22.560 how to bring this food people are
01:09:24.560 fighting over land and not really
01:09:26.319 realizing
01:09:27.040 that we're not uh we're not maximizing
01:09:30.000 our resources and our existence
01:09:32.399 we've got genius level
01:09:35.600 scientists we've got people who rogue uh
01:09:38.799 you know people who have uh broken out
01:09:41.120 of the chains like elon like imagine if
01:09:43.198 elon was
01:09:44.319 working at gm on the third floor
01:09:46.880 somewhere
01:09:47.600 you know we wouldn't have electric cars
01:09:50.399 we wouldn't have
01:09:51.600 that new porsche hybrid we wouldn't have
01:09:54.560 uh
01:09:55.679 uh what what's happening with you know
01:09:58.480 hyperloop imagine if
01:10:00.640 the guy that uh you know started airbnb
01:10:04.000 uh uh was shut down or the guys who
01:10:06.560 started uber
01:10:07.440 were shut down all of these people who
01:10:09.600 break away
01:10:10.719 and then create the new society and the
01:10:13.520 next frontier where we're going people
01:10:15.280 like i've said
01:10:16.400 like it feels to me like mit is a place
01:10:19.840 that has to be funded by people who want
01:10:23.199 to take the smartest people on the
01:10:24.640 planet
01:10:25.520 and make them work on the smallest
01:10:27.280 things that won't change
01:10:30.000 anything and i've talked to people from
01:10:32.159 mit and i could
01:10:33.120 look at these brill like this brilliant
01:10:35.120 person i was talking from mit
01:10:37.440 and he was he was afraid everything was
01:10:40.000 fear everything was about
01:10:41.360 his his girlfriend's pregnant and you
01:10:44.000 know we just got a house
01:10:45.600 and i don't want to do anything to
01:10:47.360 change this and i and this is like
01:10:49.440 one of the most brilliant people on the
01:10:51.520 planet but if you mix
01:10:53.120 brilliance with bravery that we can
01:10:55.840 ignite something even this conversation
01:10:58.159 alone can ignite the people that are
01:11:01.199 going to change the world because
01:11:02.880 there's people who have been anointed
01:11:04.400 you can't teach
01:11:06.159 the brilliance and the anointings
01:11:07.679 there's people who hit the game of life
01:11:10.239 and they've got something that they're
01:11:12.080 going to do no matter what school they
01:11:13.600 go to
01:11:14.560 they know they just know how to do it
01:11:16.400 they knew how to do it before they got
01:11:17.840 here
01:11:18.400 and they were going to do it and these
01:11:21.440 people just need to
01:11:22.560 see what it looks like to overcome
01:11:27.199 the smoke screens of public humiliation
01:11:31.679 of bankruptcy i was in debt
01:11:35.040 uh the fear loss i lost my mom or the
01:11:38.239 fear of death
01:11:39.679 you know what other fears uh are there
01:11:42.640 there's a lot of fears but
01:11:44.000 the thing is when you remove like even
01:11:45.679 in the schools you remove prayer you
01:11:47.280 remove god you remove
01:11:49.280 the fear of god you create the
01:11:51.040 possibility of the fear
01:11:52.560 of everything else but watch this
01:11:56.239 if you instill the fear of god
01:12:00.880 you eliminate the fear of anything else
01:12:06.080 and it's not that i am
01:12:10.080 fearless i am
01:12:14.239 definitely literally definitely shaking
01:12:18.400 and in so much fear of my father
01:12:22.320 i fear god and i don't fear nothing else
01:12:29.040 there's some power to that right like it
01:12:31.040 just has a mental management tool
01:12:32.960 there's some real power to that because
01:12:34.640 so many people are afraid
01:12:36.080 of every single little aspect of life
01:12:39.600 bills and debt and love and
01:12:41.360 relationships and if you have a higher
01:12:43.520 power
01:12:44.239 and this is one of the things that i've
01:12:45.600 always wanted to make what's the main
01:12:47.120 word that you use even for fear this is
01:12:48.880 the main disease
01:12:50.800 that that people use in politics it's
01:12:53.679 the main
01:12:54.239 fear is it but it's a main word it's the
01:12:56.800 disease
01:12:57.520 attacking the world because it it it
01:13:00.239 destroys your it changes your posture
01:13:02.719 it changes your idea it's worry yeah
01:13:06.159 worry yeah anxiety that's right that's
01:13:08.320 what it is stress
01:13:09.520 like it can kill you you can't be free
01:13:11.840 you can't be free to take chances
01:13:13.440 to be worried about stuff like an honest
01:13:16.320 yeah
01:13:16.800 so to be able to anchor and eliminate
01:13:19.040 worry
01:13:20.159 and say this i am walking in a righteous
01:13:23.120 path
01:13:24.239 and i don't have to worry about anything
01:13:26.239 i don't have to worry about going to
01:13:27.280 jail i have to worry about being killed
01:13:28.640 i don't have to worry about bankruptcy i
01:13:29.760 don't have to worry about
01:13:30.880 um you know uh humiliation
01:13:34.880 you know because this comes this is
01:13:36.080 where smart alec prayers can get you
01:13:38.080 i used to have this really smart outlet
01:13:39.760 prayer i said god
01:13:43.120 deliver me from pain
01:13:46.640 and then he took my mom
01:13:51.520 so it's hard to hurt that much
01:13:54.560 ever again and create it
01:13:58.960 almost like a character like deadpool
01:14:00.960 i'm like deadpool
01:14:02.320 for god like there's no
01:14:06.000 noise there's no human noise that can
01:14:08.560 and
01:14:09.199 you know someone tried to like there was
01:14:10.880 there was a friend of mine that did like
01:14:12.640 a really bad
01:14:14.320 move where he tried to say
01:14:18.159 i was using this this this lawyer and i
01:14:20.480 was about to
01:14:21.280 work with him and he said the lawyer
01:14:23.120 said he wouldn't work with you until you
01:14:25.199 get my contract done
01:14:27.120 and i was just like having do you not
01:14:30.640 know me

01:14:34.159 my hands are like this i'll cut off my
01:14:35.440 own hand i come back in the room they'd

01:14:38.400 we tied you up i'm
01:14:40.840 like
01:14:43.679 and then i go just make like a luke
01:14:45.360 skywalker
01:14:46.800 you know you know han and this is one
01:14:48.800 thing i want to say like
01:14:50.880 and it's about to make me mad right here
01:14:52.719 the first time you see me get mad in the
01:14:54.400 interview
01:14:55.360 they said that george lucas's prequels
01:14:58.719 are
01:14:59.040 worse than the corporate made disney
01:15:02.239 star wars
01:15:02.960 i'll get mad at that too like that's
01:15:05.040 [ __ ] ridiculous
01:15:06.320 revenge of the sif we saw how darth
01:15:08.960 vader was made
01:15:10.159 yeah like i watched that like 10 times
01:15:12.880 doing covet
01:15:14.719 like don't jump anakin i got the high
01:15:16.880 ground those early movies were pure
01:15:19.280 they were pure no no i'm saying
01:15:22.560 even the prequels are better than
01:15:25.280 anything
01:15:26.640 that and i'm sorry disney star wars
01:15:29.520 design team i know you're gonna like put
01:15:31.199 my
01:15:31.679 face up in the you know office and be
01:15:34.000 like forget
01:15:34.960 no man this is george this is his baby
01:15:38.159 that thing was set in his heart to show
01:15:41.600 us his children the hero's journey you
01:15:44.239 know
01:15:44.880 and these these like how can we running
01:15:48.000 back and replay like even
01:15:49.600 at disney you know there's there's
01:15:51.520 people you know at a
01:15:53.760 pixar that have left people have left
01:15:55.840 you know where
01:15:57.040 um uh they call
01:16:00.560 i've forgot the exact title but saying
01:16:02.159 like every time is a new idea
01:16:04.000 they call it like an unproven idea so
01:16:05.840 they'll get to toy story
01:16:07.679 800 000 and frozen trillion
01:16:11.440 before there's a new concept uh
01:16:14.800 to take a chance on yeah to take a
01:16:16.880 chance yeah and we've been we've been
01:16:18.239 programmed like
01:16:19.199 when you see the you know the homes the
01:16:21.360 style of homes that i've been developing
01:16:23.199 they're far closer to the way the galaxy
01:16:26.960 looks the way water looks the way our
01:16:30.080 makeup in our body
01:16:31.600 feels uh we've been uh we've been put
01:16:34.239 into these boxes and that was you know
01:16:36.000 due to money they do the construction
01:16:37.679 that we have to be in these
01:16:38.800 these boxes and we've been stuck in a
01:16:42.000 loop
01:16:42.480 like on uh westworld and something i
01:16:44.480 feel like tandy newton on westworld
01:16:46.080 where
01:16:46.640 she had to use the people that enslaved
01:16:48.800 her that trapped her
01:16:50.080 to make it to make it out you know the
01:16:53.120 uh and it's funny when i
01:16:56.560 like the box and when i'm talking about
01:16:58.159 farming i had a point about farming that
01:17:00.080 i didn't finish earlier
01:17:01.199 i hired this guy to do the a to z
01:17:03.760 concept i made it plain as day
01:17:05.199 make it so everything we cook in the
01:17:06.880 kitchen at the school
01:17:08.320 we plant it here and they would just do
01:17:10.880 it
01:17:11.360 to 70 percent they'd do it to
01:17:14.480 60 percent earlier when i had that point
01:17:16.560 i went to this whole riff about
01:17:18.080 children needing to learn physics and
01:17:19.520 children needing to learn how to really
01:17:21.280 do things and not having this separated
01:17:22.880 thing
01:17:23.520 like we are programmed to
01:17:28.000 lock ourselves in a box and what's
01:17:30.480 amazing right now is
01:17:33.199 the opportunity and the platform that we
01:17:35.280 have that the world is hurting
01:17:37.120 for everyone for those that are in power
01:17:40.880 for those that are inside the program
01:17:43.120 even those that are
01:17:44.000 in power are still a part of
01:17:47.120 the program and you know i
01:17:50.640 read this uh this tweet that someone
01:17:52.800 said i finished watching
01:17:54.800 netflix what's next and
01:17:58.239 that's so true that
01:18:02.000 we can't even program enough to satisfy
01:18:04.800 ourselves
01:18:05.920 the program is done forrest gump has
01:18:07.840 stopped running and just
01:18:09.440 turned around it's like all of this
01:18:12.080 thing is a setup the
01:18:13.760 the the the concerts that musicians go
01:18:16.320 to where we don't
01:18:17.440 you know we're not thinking about the
01:18:19.040 fact that we're not getting the lion's
01:18:20.400 share of our masters because we're
01:18:21.679 making the money on tour and then tour
01:18:23.199 has
01:18:23.760 girls and tour has the the the the arena
01:18:30.000 singing your song and i need you right
01:18:32.560 now
01:18:33.840 did you do good champ you know like uh
01:18:36.640 with floyd mayweather
01:18:38.840 um is is such a hero of mine and so
01:18:42.480 excellent because he is a a champion
01:18:45.120 right
01:18:45.760 but then also he wasn't afraid to say
01:18:49.520 i do my deals i make my money and what i
01:18:53.040 like is
01:18:54.159 you know he didn't let the the older
01:18:57.600 system
01:18:58.159 tell him how to spend his money or how
01:19:00.159 to show his money
01:19:01.280 it was up to him because he's the he's
01:19:03.360 his own king
01:19:04.880 you know god is the king of us all but
01:19:07.040 he's his own king
01:19:08.719 and a lot of times in america we haven't
01:19:10.719 seen
01:19:11.760 we haven't seen kings we haven't seen
01:19:13.600 the the the
01:19:14.960 the royal blood in our bone marrow
01:19:18.000 and the way it comes through now we can
01:19:19.760 show it
01:19:21.040 in and rap and the way we put our chains
01:19:24.159 on the way we dress we can show them the
01:19:25.760 way we play ball and things like that
01:19:27.120 but it's
01:19:27.760 another frontier to being
01:19:31.520 to being a king well there's also
01:19:33.120 something where you feel diminished
01:19:35.440 in the fact that you know that your
01:19:37.520 money is being stolen
01:19:39.760 by people that don't deserve it so if
01:19:41.679 you have some record executives if you
01:19:43.840 have some people that you know
01:19:45.120 have looped you into a [ __ ] up deal
01:19:46.960 and they're making millions while you're
01:19:48.320 making thousands
01:19:49.679 that [ __ ] with your head yeah it just
01:19:52.560 does
01:19:52.880 it makes you worry makes you stress
01:19:54.159 gives you exactly anxiety did he touch
01:19:56.159 you it could drive you crazy yeah it
01:19:57.520 could drive you crazy
01:19:58.480 yeah yeah so i still don't understand
01:20:01.360 how they talked you into medication man
01:20:03.280 i wish i knew you better
01:20:04.800 back then because uh i would have just
01:20:06.800 had you exercise
01:20:08.159 i would idea i would say so what
01:20:10.239 whatever he's doing
01:20:12.239 you can't do like you have to understand
01:20:14.480 that
01:20:15.520 different people have different amounts
01:20:18.080 of energy
01:20:18.880 they have you you have this ability
01:20:22.000 to to have these like really
01:20:24.560 all-encompassing thoughts where you have
01:20:26.320 these
01:20:27.120 long trains of ideas and thoughts in
01:20:30.560 your head and you're implementing them
01:20:32.239 this is all good this is this is a
01:20:34.960 powerful thing
01:20:36.080 i don't think it's a negative thing at
01:20:37.600 all i mean some of it comes to
01:20:40.000 you know i'm dealing with issues that
01:20:41.679 are not
01:20:43.199 just you know black and racial issues
01:20:46.880 i'm dealing with
01:20:47.679 uh maverick you know innovator issues
01:20:51.440 yeah i'm dealing with you know just as
01:20:54.159 many
01:20:55.360 uh you know issues where there's walls
01:20:58.080 of
01:20:58.639 you know invisible walls and invisible
01:21:00.480 chains as
01:21:01.840 you know michael jackson dealt with as a
01:21:03.760 black musician or
01:21:04.880 urban musician where he had to go and um
01:21:08.080 urban he came with thriller he's like
01:21:09.679 let me go get this person who directed
01:21:11.360 which is the eastwick
01:21:12.800 to i'm gonna get a movie director and he
01:21:15.199 changed
01:21:16.000 you know uh movies forever i'm dealing
01:21:18.480 with some um
01:21:19.760 some walls that you know people have
01:21:22.560 done to hold back
01:21:24.239 uh agents of change throughout history
01:21:27.679 you know
01:21:28.080 it's like the movie is here like this
01:21:30.560 part
01:21:31.199 you know us talking right now may be a
01:21:33.520 scene from my life's movie
01:21:35.520 uh like tesla was
01:21:39.040 you know a a white guy that
01:21:42.080 was a ladies man and he would be going
01:21:44.320 to all the like
01:21:45.199 fancy events and everything and like he
01:21:47.199 stopped having sex at age
01:21:48.960 40. yeah and said you know i'm going to
01:21:51.360 focus on it and
01:21:52.880 and i mean he died he died penniless
01:21:56.320 at the end you know i'm not gonna say
01:21:58.400 like he turned evil but he's trying to
01:21:59.920 sell a bomb
01:22:00.960 and he had all these like answers
01:22:04.560 uh that would change the construct of
01:22:07.840 society and like my best example is like
01:22:09.840 kodak
01:22:11.280 is there in a place where they can
01:22:12.719 barely pull it together now but they
01:22:14.560 invented
01:22:15.360 the digital camera and they didn't bring
01:22:17.760 it to market
01:22:19.360 because um because
01:22:22.840 um they had all this film to sell
01:22:26.080 well one of the things that's really you
01:22:27.679 know that's a challenge for me is
01:22:30.480 you know i've i designed
01:22:34.080 this thing this we call it the foam
01:22:36.400 runner and we built a factory for it
01:22:39.040 and cody and you can make these uh in 25
01:22:42.000 minutes
01:22:42.719 and what i'm saying about design i was
01:22:44.080 talking to one of the
01:22:46.239 just awesome designers that we just uh
01:22:48.320 uh got over yeezy we got like this
01:22:52.239 amazing crew we got guys that nike sued
01:22:54.560 us for and one of these guys i was
01:22:56.400 trying to hire him for two years
01:22:58.080 he had to he had an encounter he had to
01:23:00.000 go surf
01:23:01.280 for a year and now he's in and when he
01:23:03.600 like
01:23:04.560 you know does is um is a cad drawings
01:23:08.239 it's almost like one shot one kill you
01:23:09.840 know sometimes you design stuff you got
01:23:11.120 to do it like
01:23:12.000 five eight times like his first one is
01:23:14.159 so close
01:23:15.520 to being ready to go to market because
01:23:16.960 he sketches in a certain kind of way
01:23:18.639 and for the longest we said you know
01:23:21.040 let's um
01:23:22.560 uh i've been saying i want to get rid of
01:23:24.159 laces and
01:23:26.159 we still have shoes we sell with laces
01:23:28.080 because it's a popular shoe and people
01:23:30.480 love this shoe and it it hurts me i feel
01:23:33.199 like steve jobs trying to like remove
01:23:35.280 buttons off the side of the next
01:23:37.280 apple and one of the things that's
01:23:38.480 interesting about this if you look at
01:23:40.159 most sneakers if you look at you guys
01:23:41.679 sneakers right now
01:23:42.639 you have a tongue you know and it it
01:23:44.800 goes this direction
01:23:46.320 this is one of the innovations about
01:23:48.320 this is one reason why this is one of
01:23:49.679 the most
01:23:50.400 important sneaker designs is this goes
01:23:53.440 this way because it's ergonomic
01:23:55.520 and i remember putting it on and being
01:23:58.719 uncomfortable
01:23:59.760 with wearing it because i'm so used to
01:24:01.679 like the way like a jordan or something
01:24:04.560 fits with my jeans and i remember
01:24:06.239 talking to kobe and him talking about
01:24:08.480 having to make sneakers that fit with
01:24:10.239 jeans and that was a big thing because
01:24:12.800 you know that's what we grow up we go
01:24:14.719 you know coconut jeans and jordans or
01:24:17.120 something like that so
01:24:18.320 um this also i feel that
01:24:22.239 just the process when i design i become
01:24:25.440 like a three-year-old i have to go to my
01:24:27.600 gut i have to forget everything i know
01:24:29.760 and really focus in to what i feel like
01:24:32.639 some straight jedi
01:24:34.320 yoda or like you know if i could grab
01:24:36.159 that water bottle like
01:24:37.520 like wouldn't it have been cool if i
01:24:38.480 just did it right now i should have had
01:24:39.440 a magnet on there that you feel like
01:24:41.920 he'd be like yo this dude's a wizard
01:24:45.120 um so
01:24:48.639 so so for me you know i i'm gonna make
01:24:52.000 this shoe
01:24:53.520 be twenty dollars and you know
01:24:56.639 money isn't real so that means the world
01:24:58.400 should be eventually free
01:25:00.239 so i'm gonna manifest the world being
01:25:03.360 free my dad
01:25:04.960 he lives in a dr and he says you know
01:25:07.280 anything
01:25:08.719 that you put in the ground grows so why
01:25:11.600 do people
01:25:12.000 still go hungry and i like that in
01:25:14.320 theory but i was like man farming is
01:25:16.080 really hard though man i think
01:25:17.679 you know i might go hungry if i have
01:25:19.440 someone to farm this food
01:25:21.120 it's like but you know back in the days
01:25:23.679 we
01:25:24.159 we had that skill set now we're losing
01:25:26.320 these skill sets that actually we can
01:25:28.080 sustain off of
01:25:29.440 uh so with this uh and i
01:25:32.560 i love giving you guys my riffs i'm like
01:25:34.719 a human version
01:25:36.000 of instagram when you look at instagram
01:25:38.560 you look at
01:25:39.280 you know you're looking like a hundred
01:25:41.199 images a day
01:25:43.120 uh well i've got millions of images
01:25:46.400 in my mind and the majority of them
01:25:50.000 haven't been realized yet you know
01:25:53.040 there's some
01:25:53.520 images that are from my memory but i got
01:25:55.600 this whole
01:25:56.560 the future that's in my mind that has to
01:25:59.040 be brought
01:25:59.600 so this is you know you talk about hype
01:26:01.840 culture and shoes being sold
01:26:03.520 on the you know the resale market and
01:26:06.000 yeezy
01:26:06.800 lives in that place but i i you know
01:26:09.920 i don't like the idea i don't love the
01:26:12.639 idea
01:26:13.679 that some of the reason why people buy
01:26:15.679 it is just
01:26:17.600 uh for hype culture or
01:26:21.120 you ain't got this or i got this
01:26:22.560 colorway and you don't have it that type
01:26:23.920 of mentality
01:26:24.960 i mean it's i'm an essentialist i'm a
01:26:27.440 i'm a minimalist
01:26:29.040 and like i i i have to i will
01:26:32.800 bring the the fully a to z
01:26:36.480 our existence version to existence like
01:26:40.159 victor gruen
01:26:41.280 designed the shopping centers but he
01:26:44.159 designed full utopian communities
01:26:46.320 and people were like oh we're just cool
01:26:48.480 with the shopping center that's all we
01:26:50.159 want
01:26:50.719 and these ideas that he had never got
01:26:53.440 brought into fruition a little bit like
01:26:55.120 disney kind of based epcot center on
01:26:57.360 like
01:26:57.840 on victor gruen but these
01:27:00.960 this next frontier of these communities
01:27:03.760 and villages of happiness
01:27:05.520 are way closer to a kenyan village
01:27:08.639 than it is to like a gated community uh
01:27:11.920 village but one of the things about your
01:27:15.199 this aversion to hype culture one of the
01:27:17.520 good things about the hype culture is
01:27:19.679 if people get into your products they're
01:27:21.920 going to get into you and they're going
01:27:23.199 to get into your ideas
01:27:24.880 and all these ideas that you have will
01:27:27.520 become a part of their thought process
01:27:29.199 they'll start thinking about it
01:27:30.639 they go hey he's got some great points
01:27:32.880 if people really get into your [ __ ]
01:27:34.719 they're also really going to get into
01:27:36.000 your ideas i think it's one of the
01:27:37.840 things that make people uncomfortable
01:27:39.040 about you
01:27:39.600 is you have the courage to have all
01:27:42.239 these bold ideas
01:27:43.360 and to implement them and to do all
01:27:45.520 these different things
01:27:46.400 that bothers people and there's a lot of
01:27:48.159 people that don't have that kind of
01:27:50.159 courage
01:27:50.800 and they are straddled down by anxiety
01:27:53.920 and they see a guy like you and they
01:27:55.360 like try to find flaws
01:27:57.360 they try to find things that are wrong
01:27:58.880 with it instead of looking at the
01:28:00.560 positive aspects of it
01:28:02.000 they'll only concentrate on the negative
01:28:03.520 aspects of it i don't think i don't see
01:28:05.920 it that way i've never saw it that way
01:28:07.520 i look you look at that guy [ __ ] do
01:28:09.440 anything there's people like tesla
01:28:11.120 and there's people who you know there's
01:28:12.960 a person who
01:28:14.320 killed animals with tesla cords to make
01:28:16.159 people not like tesla yeah the personal
01:28:18.000 citizen
01:28:18.560 yeah person who made the electric chair
01:28:20.480 be made with the tesla courts
01:28:21.840 for so people wouldn't like tesla tesla
01:28:23.679 still has inventions that haven't been
01:28:26.000 brought
01:28:26.880 to our society that would have brought
01:28:29.120 more simplicity and happiness to our
01:28:30.880 society
01:28:31.440 like the westinghouse ability to
01:28:32.960 transmit electricity through the air
01:28:34.719 which is fascinating i don't know if
01:28:36.719 that would have worked in today's
01:28:38.080 world with cell phones and all the
01:28:40.320 different electronics and even
01:28:42.560 you know modern air travel i don't know
01:28:45.120 i don't know what it
01:28:46.320 would have worked but things would have
01:28:48.080 been different people
01:28:49.360 are over designing into industries where
01:28:51.760 they see they can make some money as
01:28:53.360 opposed to stepping back and saying
01:28:55.360 how do we look at the entire earth
01:28:59.600 as an opportunity to free
01:29:03.920 everyone and create happiness for
01:29:07.280 for everyone so like only a b there's
01:29:09.760 only a billion people on the internet
01:29:11.360 you never think about that there's seven
01:29:12.880 to eight billion people on the on earth
01:29:15.120 but then there's only a billion people
01:29:17.360 that are influenced
01:29:18.480 and that are on the internet we feel
01:29:20.880 like the internet
01:29:22.080 is everything it's only like 15 you know
01:29:25.280 16
01:29:26.159 18 of human beings
01:29:30.080 but in order to make
01:29:33.440 for our civilization for us to survive
01:29:35.520 we have to make more human beings we
01:29:37.120 have
01:29:37.600 we have family we have we have to have
01:29:39.679 food we have to have shelter
01:29:41.520 that we don't have to have the internet
01:29:43.679 we don't have to have
01:29:44.960 music we don't have to have you know
01:29:47.360 that's a conversation
01:29:48.639 i mean i mean i mean it enhances life
01:29:51.520 yeah it enhances the quality of life
01:29:53.520 is better but look at the music look
01:29:55.520 look at look at what the information
01:29:58.080 where we're we're uh we're putting in it
01:30:01.679 like i feel bad
01:30:03.280 when i hear uh rap songs i feel bad even
01:30:06.880 the stuff that
01:30:08.239 you know i just recently put out i was
01:30:10.320 like you know how you listen to lames
01:30:12.480 they the imitation man like why is
01:30:15.120 that's just
01:30:15.760 i don't like that message because we're
01:30:17.920 all the imitation of our parents and
01:30:19.600 imitation of this invitation and then
01:30:21.440 imitation of adam and eve you know we're
01:30:24.159 and
01:30:24.880 we're uh we're all the next versions
01:30:28.320 there should be the v2 v3 v4
01:30:30.400 like you know michelangelo and da vinci
01:30:32.880 had the same teacher
01:30:34.400 you know there's times where you know my
01:30:37.520 like
01:30:38.800 uh people work with me or just say like
01:30:41.040 my mentees or whatever will go out
01:30:43.040 and they'll do something uh that i
01:30:45.520 wanted to do and then i'm i'm torn
01:30:47.520 because as a man
01:30:48.960 you know i'm i'm i'm jealous and i'm
01:30:51.679 proud
01:30:52.480 at the same time and it's like a
01:30:53.679 father-son relationship because
01:30:55.440 sometimes when the when the sun goes out
01:30:58.080 and is more successful at things
01:31:01.600 the father wants to say that's a good
01:31:03.760 job but every time the son does
01:31:05.199 something that's a good job it reminds
01:31:06.480 the father of his failures
01:31:08.080 yes so it's just i mean it's a it's a
01:31:11.920 it's a it's a strong dynamic that that's
01:31:14.880 where i have to lean on god
01:31:17.199 to not be like you know this uh
01:31:21.120 this like uh prick
01:31:24.159 that's jealous of you know people who
01:31:27.280 are innovating or taking
01:31:29.600 you know the the goal line because we
01:31:31.600 got to realize we're in a relay race of
01:31:33.520 humanity
01:31:34.719 at a certain point whoever you know what
01:31:37.760 what what the inventors in the in the
01:31:40.000 past did is now handed over to the
01:31:41.760 inventors today
01:31:42.800 they're handed over to the next vendors
01:31:44.880 well the good thing about the walls and
01:31:46.639 the perception and all that is
01:31:48.719 this like smaller barrier to entry
01:31:52.960 allows there to be you know a walt
01:31:55.679 disney
01:31:56.880 and a steve jobs and a henry ford so
01:32:00.639 what i'm doing right now
01:32:02.159 there's a there's a there's a real
01:32:04.480 barrier to entry to doing
01:32:05.920 constructing homes and communities and
01:32:07.679 farms like you can't
01:32:09.840 you can't just do it like how you can
01:32:11.440 just you know
01:32:13.360 it's hard for someone to go from i'm not
01:32:15.920 saying it can't happen
01:32:17.199 i'm just saying that it's difficult for
01:32:19.360 someone to go from
01:32:20.880 you know programming and putting their
01:32:22.960 music out on the internet today
01:32:24.719 to what it was that michael jackson had
01:32:26.880 to do that very entry was so hard for
01:32:29.280 him
01:32:29.920 that i mean since he this guy was the
01:32:31.600 leader of the jackson five when he was
01:32:32.960 five
01:32:33.360 like his entire life led up and this is
01:32:35.840 what he focused on
01:32:37.120 and it made and it was all focused on
01:32:39.440 that
01:32:40.239 so it made the great michael jackson now
01:32:43.520 i want to do this comparison of disney
01:32:45.840 uh steve
01:32:46.800 and uh uh henry ford and what yeezy is
01:32:52.639 it's really hard to make houses it's a
01:32:54.960 it's like a corrupt
01:32:56.000 uh industry also you got contra how many
01:32:58.080 times have you started on a house and uh
01:33:00.239 contractors like start over charging for
01:33:02.560 stuff and the budget ends up being
01:33:04.159 twice the amount and it's twice as long
01:33:06.480 look
01:33:07.600 if you had a relationship that's why
01:33:09.760 relationships are
01:33:10.960 a better currency than uh than um
01:33:14.080 than money if you had a relationship
01:33:16.000 with the contractors
01:33:17.520 if you were part of their family your
01:33:19.840 house would be done
01:33:20.719 quick i feel like it's a practical joke
01:33:22.880 on rich people
01:33:24.080 how long houses take to build
01:33:27.280 i was in the airport and there was a
01:33:30.159 first class line that was super slow
01:33:32.480 and there was a coach area with like
01:33:34.639 eight openings and there was no one
01:33:36.000 in it and then i hopped out and this
01:33:39.199 other gentleman hopped out with me and
01:33:40.719 went through that line and we went
01:33:41.840 through
01:33:42.560 but the rich people with the hermes
01:33:44.560 belts didn't want to lose their position
01:33:47.120 so bad that they would rather wait in
01:33:50.080 the first class line
01:33:51.360 than to have the time back and go
01:33:52.880 through that now this gentleman
01:33:55.120 is a surgeon that works on people's
01:33:57.520 hearts through their
01:33:58.639 feet so it's like that kind of engineer
01:34:01.520 serger doctor mentality he's like yeah i
01:34:03.600 got money because
01:34:04.560 this this is what i'm doing but i'm here
01:34:06.880 to serve and i have a mentality that i'm
01:34:08.639 not better
01:34:09.440 than the person that's in coach which is
01:34:12.719 the reason why we were the only two that
01:34:14.320 went through
01:34:15.440 uh that how do you segue off of this
01:34:17.760 when i just go into this like how do you
01:34:19.040 even find
01:34:20.000 a question what are you thinking over
01:34:23.120 there right now
01:34:23.679 there's no goodness yeah yeah there's no
01:34:26.000 reason to
01:34:26.880 worry about it yeah you you have this
01:34:29.600 thought do you have a rigid
01:34:31.520 process that you organize your day with
01:34:34.080 like how do you
01:34:34.880 you you seem to have so many different
01:34:36.320 thoughts and so many different things
01:34:37.520 going on simultaneously
01:34:39.120 like how do you how do you organize your
01:34:41.040 day
01:34:43.199 do you have like ritual do you have yes
01:34:46.000 i

01:34:49.920 i drive my kids to school and
01:34:53.520 i stay at school with them all day and
01:34:58.000 you know i'm in the kitchen
01:35:01.199 like uh working with
01:35:04.880 the top chefs on the planet to create
01:35:08.000 this
01:35:08.480 you know these healthy menus and i'm
01:35:10.320 working with the farmer so
01:35:11.920 the school that i'm at is also
01:35:15.760 um it's like this new
01:35:20.159 i don't wanna no disrespect to nasa i
01:35:22.239 was gonna say new nasa but
01:35:24.239 um of humanity that we're anchoring it
01:35:27.920 around uh our children so that's what my
01:35:31.119 day consists of but then i
01:35:32.639 also uh in the past couple months
01:35:36.080 have been going to atlanta for two days
01:35:38.000 a week or three days a week
01:35:39.679 uh because i'm building this uh 120
01:35:43.679 000 uh oh i'm not supposed to say that
01:35:47.520 i'm building
01:35:48.239 we're building a sound stage but um and
01:35:51.360 but it was funny because i go back and
01:35:53.360 forth
01:35:53.840 on content should i work in content
01:35:58.239 should i work in tech i have all these
01:36:00.159 like website ideas and
01:36:01.760 tech ideas and i sometimes i was like
01:36:04.159 i'll say i'm cursed by tech
01:36:06.000 like i'm not you know i don't have any
01:36:07.760 curses um
01:36:10.320 or god has lets me break the curses and
01:36:12.880 break the chains i rather say
01:36:16.159 i i don't know if content is my calling
01:36:20.159 like messaging like let me show you what
01:36:23.119 a school of the future
01:36:24.480 looks like let me show you a monasteries
01:36:26.080 of the future let me show you the farms
01:36:27.840 of the future look like but we're 20
01:36:29.920 years past the future
01:36:31.199 like it's in 2020 like we're supposed to
01:36:33.280 be in the future by 2000
01:36:34.639 so it's my job to pull the future into
01:36:37.280 now and that's something i struggle with
01:36:39.360 when i talk about the different things
01:36:40.639 that i'm doing
01:36:41.520 getting into the idea of doing like
01:36:44.159 content for netflix or content for hulu
01:36:46.880 and like
01:36:48.000 what that content because i believe
01:36:49.679 we're in the movie i believe we're in
01:36:51.760 the game
01:36:52.480 we're in like grand theft auto it's just
01:36:54.880 too many things that
01:36:56.480 align and we're not we can terraform
01:37:00.239 what we can do is be like if your grand
01:37:02.000 theft auto character just started
01:37:03.679 redesigning the world
01:37:05.679 himself like painting his own his own
01:37:08.560 world we have this opportunity
01:37:10.400 to make life as fun as these second
01:37:13.280 lives
01:37:13.920 but if you look at how politics
01:37:17.679 just general unhappiness misery control
01:37:20.880 the speed that contractors go the
01:37:22.639 farmers that wouldn't finish the farm
01:37:24.880 the way we are with each other is why
01:37:27.040 people feel like look
01:37:28.239 everyone's going to go into like this
01:37:29.840 ready player one
01:37:31.520 second life and i believe that our first
01:37:34.480 life
01:37:35.119 can be just as a imaginative
01:37:38.400 uh and it will be so that's my and i
01:37:41.040 have a bunch of friends that work in the
01:37:42.560 gaming
01:37:43.199 industry and i have friends that work in
01:37:44.719 the content industry and i'm saying
01:37:46.560 i'm anchoring on real life to make real
01:37:49.600 life as
01:37:50.400 awesome as games to make real life as
01:37:53.360 awesome as uh movies
01:37:55.600 so did i answer the question of my
01:37:58.239 schedule
01:37:58.880 every day yeah but i mean you so you
01:38:01.280 just basically
01:38:02.159 go on what you feel like working on you
01:38:05.119 you basically
01:38:06.320 just start your day you you do your
01:38:09.520 stuff with your kids
01:38:10.480 and then whatever these ideas you have
01:38:13.280 you just
01:38:13.920 nourish them you just encourage them you
01:38:16.560 just
01:38:17.119 you just feed whatever thoughts are in
01:38:19.119 your head
01:38:20.159 well yeah but what i was expressing
01:38:24.000 on that on that last um symphony i gave
01:38:27.600 you was uh
01:38:30.880 this uh was um that i do have this
01:38:34.639 challenge that's where i'm designing i'm
01:38:36.239 just
01:38:36.719 i'm actually designing what i'm doing
01:38:38.639 with my time saying
01:38:39.750 [Music]
01:38:41.520 should i be even taking a meeting like
01:38:44.239 when i take a meeting
01:38:45.520 this i know if it's a good or bad
01:38:46.960 meeting if someone's talking to me and i
01:38:48.800 just get sleepy
01:38:50.000 i know that that's not what i should do
01:38:52.239 but if someone's talking i'm
01:38:53.760 you know energized i like saying the
01:38:55.760 word energize over the word excited
01:38:58.320 because this is what they do to this is
01:39:00.159 what they do to
01:39:01.440 all of us they get us excited excited
01:39:03.600 and anxiety they kind of go together
01:39:05.199 like someone can say hey i
01:39:06.639 got you a new car um and it's across the
01:39:09.840 street
01:39:10.400 you get so excited you run across the
01:39:11.760 street get hit by a car trying to run to
01:39:13.760 your new
01:39:14.320 but if you're energized about having the
01:39:16.400 car perhaps you look both ways see i
01:39:18.320 played this dictionary game with the
01:39:20.480 like this uh um this small webster
01:39:24.080 pocket dictionary
01:39:25.119 and we'll go to a page and say go to
01:39:27.199 page with the word help on it
01:39:28.880 and we say highlight all the words you
01:39:30.480 think are positive and then we talk
01:39:31.920 about afterwards
01:39:32.960 why do you think that's positive so the
01:39:34.239 word help is like
01:39:36.880 it's like a uh it's like a bad leg on a
01:39:41.440 table
01:39:42.080 you think you could stand on it but if
01:39:43.440 you stand right there that table could
01:39:44.800 flip over
01:39:45.520 the fourth definition in the word help
01:39:48.000 is
01:39:49.040 to ignore and it actually makes sense
01:39:52.719 you know oh like if you have a meeting
01:39:54.719 right here's the answer when you know
01:39:55.840 the meeting didn't go do good
01:39:57.600 uh after it didn't go well the person
01:39:59.440 says it then oh how can i help that
01:40:00.960 means they don't want to do nothing
01:40:02.639 let me just give you a phone number
01:40:04.239 right you know the word
01:40:05.679 is to ensure and then there's a lot of
01:40:08.639 words that end with ure
01:40:10.639 that are very powerful future sure
01:40:13.920 pure endure and um
01:40:18.080 that that goes into like the rhyme
01:40:19.600 because i'm literally trying to figure
01:40:20.800 out the video game
01:40:21.679 at all times and see where these things
01:40:23.760 uh parallel i know this can get into
01:40:25.199 like a riff where people like
01:40:26.560 okay yeah you're losing what you're
01:40:27.840 saying right now but um
01:40:31.600 but look at that look at the dictionary
01:40:33.040 look at these words i have friends uh
01:40:35.840 that
01:40:36.480 uh english is their second or third or
01:40:38.400 eighth language and they say that
01:40:40.000 english is the hardest
01:40:41.760 language to learn because there's so
01:40:42.960 many words to
01:40:44.800 uh to that mean the same thing it it
01:40:47.440 like it tears me to my core that
01:40:49.520 my daughter has to learn two the
01:40:52.560 difference between two t-o-o
01:40:54.480 and t-o i wanna just be like
01:40:57.520 just draw the number two like just make
01:40:59.760 it like sometimes i don't know
01:41:01.760 when you know the difference i'm like a
01:41:03.360 terrible speller
01:41:05.119 and i believe that there's like
01:41:06.480 curriculums that are that are european
01:41:09.360 curriculums that don't even apply to
01:41:12.719 our genes you know who we are as a
01:41:14.960 people like african descent people
01:41:17.040 we don't even talk like that like this
01:41:19.119 is a skill set but i'm still
01:41:20.639 talking white basically like you'll see
01:41:23.040 like a black pastor
01:41:24.880 you know give this amazing like sermon
01:41:27.040 or like marry someone i was at a wedding
01:41:28.960 and this guy
01:41:30.400 they said wow he speaks so well well
01:41:32.320 what do you mean well he speaks
01:41:33.679 super white like yeah that's what the
01:41:37.119 definition of well
01:41:38.560 right right it's just sounds that you
01:41:40.719 use and to communicate ideas
01:41:42.480 right yeah well it's funny i bumped it
01:41:44.239 to a friend of mine
01:41:45.600 um i actually met williams i said uh
01:41:48.080 givenchy i wasn't expecting to see
01:41:49.840 i wasn't expecting i mean expecting
01:41:53.679 to see him i wasn't expecting to see him
01:41:56.159 and
01:41:57.040 we're at the mercer lobby and he caught
01:41:58.880 me off guard
01:42:00.159 and i was like i didn't use words
01:42:04.239 when when i when i when i saw him i like
01:42:08.159 almost communicated in a different
01:42:09.920 language like a language like joy or
01:42:11.679 happiness only 30 percent of our
01:42:13.280 communication
01:42:14.480 is is verbal that's why the masks just
01:42:16.880 really throw me off because
01:42:18.560 i can't tell what someone
01:42:21.600 is thinking and feeling because a lot of
01:42:24.400 times half the time people don't say
01:42:25.920 what they're thinking and feeling
01:42:27.280 and i have to decode with the mask
01:42:30.320 i can only you know hear what they're
01:42:33.040 saying
01:42:33.600 that's the problem with social media too
01:42:35.040 right yes things are black and white and
01:42:36.880 things being
01:42:37.760 taken out of context i mean that's the
01:42:39.840 reason why people
01:42:41.119 like you know love the show that they're
01:42:42.719 like oh we got the yay
01:42:44.400 joe rogan we can hear him go into all of
01:42:46.960 these riffs
01:42:47.760 yeah and we can feel him you could see
01:42:51.600 you know how i'm looking you can see my
01:42:53.280 energy and the way i'm saying it too
01:42:55.040 yeah so and
01:42:56.719 you see people sitting down having an
01:42:58.800 actual conversation
01:43:00.080 a real conversation yeah and and a
01:43:02.800 conversation where
01:43:04.080 anybody that comes on this show you
01:43:06.560 don't have like this
01:43:07.679 like sometimes with reporters they have
01:43:11.199 like
01:43:12.000 people that are media they have like a
01:43:13.760 complex you don't have a complex you're
01:43:15.920 like yo
01:43:16.719 let's first off to get this straight
01:43:18.320 like if i like
01:43:19.920 i could whip your ass i'm joe rogan i'm
01:43:21.520 a professional fighter now let's start
01:43:23.280 the conversation
01:43:24.239 which i think is another reason like
01:43:26.159 with nick cannon he's like
01:43:27.360 man i married mariah carey i did all
01:43:29.440 these and both of these interviews have
01:43:31.280 been very positive because people aren't
01:43:33.040 carrying
01:43:34.080 something already like some form of chip
01:43:36.080 on their shoulder where they gotta like
01:43:38.480 atta every sentence sometimes i talk to
01:43:40.639 reporters it's like
01:43:41.760 they're saying the thing they wanted to
01:43:43.520 say to this guy in high school that they
01:43:45.760 never got to
01:43:46.960 complete the conversation and they're
01:43:48.639 taking it out
01:43:50.239 on me i'm like
01:43:53.760 yeah i think there's a lot of people
01:43:55.360 that have conversations with people and
01:43:56.960 they want to
01:43:57.840 create a viral moment too that it's not
01:44:00.320 just a conversation
01:44:01.520 they they have an agenda it's it's
01:44:03.840 almost like you were talking about the
01:44:04.880 disney star wars movies
01:44:06.560 that then it's not a work of art it's
01:44:09.520 it's a formula
01:44:11.040 like two plus two is four let's put
01:44:13.520 those together we'll make some money
01:44:15.199 instead of the original star wars which
01:44:17.280 was the hero's journey which was like a
01:44:19.119 joseph campbell book
01:44:20.560 it's just like there was a beauty and a
01:44:22.880 purity to it
01:44:23.920 it's a it's an expression like someone
01:44:25.520 comes up with an idea and they bring it
01:44:27.520 to fruition
01:44:28.480 and then you get to watch and you're
01:44:29.760 like wow it moves you
01:44:31.840 the new movies don't move you and it was
01:44:33.920 a crew
01:44:34.960 of of um of leaders of thought leaders
01:44:39.119 that like i was a
01:44:40.320 is it brian de palma that told george to
01:44:43.840 put the words at the beginning because
01:44:45.840 it's like you really
01:44:47.360 i all i've been feeling like is like
01:44:49.040 when i talk up to this point i just been
01:44:51.199 making thx
01:44:52.880 you know and then the toys from star
01:44:56.639 wars have not come out first which would
01:44:58.080 be like
01:44:58.719 you know like the yeezys or something
01:45:00.560 like that and now some making the whole
01:45:02.800 star wars
01:45:03.679 in real life like backwards like the
01:45:06.080 product came first kind of like disney
01:45:07.520 like disney
01:45:08.400 he was mickey mouse became super popular
01:45:10.800 before he was able to get all of his
01:45:12.560 imagineers uh imagineers in
01:45:15.840 i want to point out you know when people
01:45:18.000 talk about
01:45:19.199 being you know self-absorbed or the
01:45:21.840 center of your own universe
01:45:23.760 um what's the main character in star
01:45:26.800 wars name
01:45:29.199 luke skywalker who created star wars
01:45:32.800 george lucas oh
01:45:35.920 but did he write it but listen to that
01:45:38.159 last name yeah
01:45:39.119 that's yeah george luke
01:45:43.040 yes yeah he's the main character in star
01:45:46.400 wars
01:45:47.199 he gets this esther
01:45:53.520 and it was awesome yeah there's there's
01:45:56.320 something about
01:45:57.360 uh things that are pure right versus
01:46:00.080 things that are
01:46:01.040 attempting to recreate something that
01:46:03.360 people are going to like
01:46:04.960 there's there's a difference and it's
01:46:06.800 it's in music as well right like
01:46:08.800 your your music resonates with people
01:46:10.639 because it's obviously coming from your
01:46:12.080 mind
01:46:12.800 whereas some people are creating songs
01:46:15.360 that they think are going to be hits
01:46:17.280 they're creating top 40 it's coming from
01:46:19.760 my heart
01:46:20.639 and my gut but when it's the most pure
01:46:24.159 it's coming from god and i'm being used
01:46:26.159 as a channel it's like when
01:46:28.239 tanya harden hit the the triple flip
01:46:31.280 you know she had all that skill and then
01:46:33.520 at some point
01:46:34.480 it's not called a trip i'm about to say
01:46:36.880 trippy triple lindy like is rajiv
01:46:39.119 or rodney dangerfield or something but
01:46:40.560 it's like
01:46:42.560 there's these moments where we do things
01:46:45.119 that are
01:46:46.320 seem like superhero level and i think
01:46:48.400 that's what m knight
01:46:49.520 shalamon was laying out for us
01:46:52.960 with unbreakable uh
01:46:56.480 glass and what was the other one with
01:46:58.320 the guy with the multiple personalities
01:47:00.000 just like he's got three of these
01:47:01.760 films that are like showing us hey
01:47:04.480 you're
01:47:04.880 superheroes you can believe it the
01:47:07.280 greatest disabler
01:47:08.960 of our of of our abilities our greatest
01:47:12.800 our greatest kryptonite is doubt right
01:47:15.280 you know
01:47:15.920 fear yeah doubt like why did i um
01:47:19.280 you know um
01:47:22.480 like going to why did i register so late
01:47:25.600 uh to run for president covet
01:47:28.719 i like i remember like i i had
01:47:32.239 uh i had the virus and i was sitting
01:47:35.760 you know quarantined in my house and my
01:47:39.119 cousin
01:47:40.080 text me about being prepared to run for
01:47:43.520 president
01:47:44.560 and i just completely pull like put it
01:47:47.679 off to the side
01:47:49.040 because i was like shivering and you
01:47:50.880 know having the shakes and taking hot
01:47:52.400 showers and eating soup and
01:47:54.159 you know just sleeping i don't think it
01:47:56.400 was that bad
01:47:57.440 i think it was a mild case um
01:48:00.639 and it just threw off i mean it threw
01:48:04.480 everyone off it threw everybody's plans
01:48:06.159 off
01:48:06.960 and then you know it was just this
01:48:09.440 calling on my heart and i remember
01:48:10.880 talking to like really like
01:48:12.159 elitist um uh
01:48:16.159 you know writers you know i was trying
01:48:18.880 to avoid saying white supremacists but
01:48:20.480 like
01:48:20.800 elite like the the the liberal elites
01:48:24.159 are like you know so
01:48:29.199 boy who you gonna vote on you know like
01:48:31.199 who are you to run for
01:48:32.560 office and why would you sign up for
01:48:35.840 office
01:48:36.400 you know uh if you if you can't even get
01:48:39.280 on ballots
01:48:40.480 that's people are saying that to me and
01:48:42.960 i could get on the ballot
01:48:44.400 it's like there's black mothers that go
01:48:46.320 into hospital
01:48:47.520 and the doctor will tell them that
01:48:48.800 there's something wrong with their child
01:48:50.080 to get them
01:48:50.800 to this is happening uh to this date
01:48:54.159 and then when people say you know are
01:48:55.600 you are you a pawn
01:48:57.760 like for the republicans
01:49:01.600 the reason why i think that people are
01:49:04.400 asking me that is because the
01:49:06.000 because the democrats do create black
01:49:07.760 pawns
01:49:09.199 they do have celebrities that they'll
01:49:11.440 sit down and meet with and say you're
01:49:12.960 going to be an advocate
01:49:14.400 for the democratic party and you know
01:49:17.280 everyone's like
01:49:19.040 you know and i'm not trying to take any
01:49:20.639 sides of like republicans or democrats
01:49:22.400 i'm just saying why where
01:49:23.679 why were people so much thinking that i
01:49:26.159 was like
01:49:27.440 uh a form of uh a pawn and then the idea
01:49:32.159 that you know liberals would say like
01:49:35.440 the funny thing is liberals i think uh
01:49:37.520 and i'm i'm
01:49:39.920 i don't know if i could classify myself
01:49:42.639 as liberal but
01:49:43.760 i'm i'm definitely kind of liberal elite
01:49:45.599 i wrote my beautiful dark twisted
01:49:47.040 fantasy like i've had some of the best
01:49:49.360 writing so that would put me in that
01:49:52.719 class so to say but i'm also just a
01:49:56.080 purist like i see a kenyan home and be
01:49:58.159 like that's beautiful right there i'm
01:50:00.080 not like
01:50:00.800 i gotta have the so the
01:50:04.080 one of the most racist things that
01:50:06.400 liberals who pride themselves on not
01:50:07.840 being racist
01:50:09.040 have said to me is like uh you're gonna
01:50:12.320 split the black vote
01:50:13.760 and that makes it seem like black people
01:50:17.040 can't make decisions for ourselves and
01:50:20.000 that
01:50:20.320 don't know white people know me like i'm
01:50:22.719 like only
01:50:23.520 the liberal they literally make it
01:50:24.800 saying like only
01:50:26.560 black people will vote for me right
01:50:28.800 think about that statement the
01:50:30.320 the nuance of institutionalized
01:50:33.920 racism and this would be like somebody
01:50:37.119 from the art world
01:50:38.000 you know i mean they just have a place
01:50:40.320 where
01:50:41.280 no one has really been able to embrace
01:50:43.520 the idea
01:50:44.880 of blacks not being in a block
01:50:48.960 and staying in one place right or blacks
01:50:51.679 having a devote democrat
01:50:52.960 yeah or blacks have an opinion like us
01:50:55.119 not being on boards or
01:50:56.719 us being like handlers for other black
01:51:00.080 people meaning like
01:51:01.360 if we work at a label or we work at a
01:51:03.360 big corporation
01:51:04.560 it's our job to go talk to the other
01:51:06.639 black people
01:51:07.840 you know to calm other black people down
01:51:10.800 but we're working for
01:51:12.719 you know uh universal or vivendi
01:51:16.159 or uh whatever the
01:51:20.080 organizations were you know i was
01:51:21.679 thinking about buying my masters and i
01:51:23.440 realized that that was too small of a
01:51:25.520 thought
01:51:26.560 i'm gonna buy universal
01:51:29.920 they're only a 33 billion organization
01:51:32.880 i'm one of the greatest product
01:51:34.239 producers
01:51:35.199 that ever existed i'm i'm and i'm a
01:51:38.000 child
01:51:38.880 i'm 43 years old i was 53 million
01:51:41.360 dollars in debt
01:51:42.880 uh uh you know four years ago
01:51:46.159 and now it's proven that i'm the new
01:51:48.800 michael jordan
01:51:49.840 of products i went to adidas and
01:51:53.599 we were a 15 billion organization
01:51:56.880 losing 2 billion before kova hit our
01:51:59.360 market cap was 68 billion
01:52:01.040 i went to the gap and are partnered with
01:52:04.800 the gap
01:52:05.599 and our stock jumped 45
01:52:09.440 in two hours the organization made two
01:52:12.560 billion dollars
01:52:13.920 and two out in two hours and now
01:52:17.040 we've doubled we i mean the gap was uh
01:52:20.320 mark cap was lower than yeezy it was
01:52:22.000 like three billion dollars
01:52:23.599 when when when i first got there now
01:52:25.280 it's like seven
01:52:26.719 eight billion dollars and we haven't
01:52:28.800 even released the product yet
01:52:30.880 but what i loved i you know i sat there
01:52:33.280 and i did the deal without getting on
01:52:35.040 the board
01:52:36.080 and i looked at my cousin and i and i i
01:52:39.119 didn't want to sign the deal without
01:52:40.400 being on the board and i looked at him
01:52:41.360 and said i'm doing this for you
01:52:42.800 meaning like this is part of a relay
01:52:44.560 race it would just be a given
01:52:46.800 that if someone of color
01:52:49.840 was to your position my position of
01:52:52.159 influence
01:52:52.880 would be on the board but michael jordan
01:52:54.960 had to break down walls
01:52:56.880 and michael jackson had to break down
01:52:58.320 walls for
01:53:00.159 us to break down the next walls and the
01:53:02.480 next walls are
01:53:03.760 the boardroom because you know what the
01:53:05.040 boardroom is it's an opinion
01:53:07.040 see people are fine for us to play
01:53:09.760 basketball and
01:53:11.280 you know rap and make clothes
01:53:15.119 but the the society is set up is not
01:53:20.080 really used to refine with us actually
01:53:21.920 having an opinion
01:53:23.360 and i can understand why because what is
01:53:25.440 our opinion based on
01:53:27.119 if we grew up thinking we were slaves
01:53:30.239 if our opinion isn't based on hey my dad
01:53:32.480 taught me how to run this company
01:53:34.080 you know my dad is smarter than me and
01:53:36.320 everything he wanted to do
01:53:37.760 black people thought he was crazy and he
01:53:39.920 had to do it with
01:53:41.199 white people who thought he was
01:53:42.800 incompetent because he was black
01:53:44.880 and the way these companies and the way
01:53:48.960 uh the music industry the way managers
01:53:51.760 and the way society generally looks at
01:53:54.800 uh black people is
01:53:57.840 the way like a misogynistic man looks at
01:54:00.880 a hot lady
01:54:02.880 what can you give me what can you do for
01:54:05.440 me
01:54:05.920 no one a misogynistic man not gonna look
01:54:07.760 at a hot lady and say
01:54:10.000 can you run my company so
01:54:13.920 you know this idea of me you know and i
01:54:16.800 i i got like
01:54:18.159 you know i'm building my factories i've
01:54:19.679 just simplified the design
01:54:21.199 and i was working with a guy that uh you
01:54:24.080 know
01:54:24.560 um that's helping me to you know build
01:54:27.119 some of the factories it was an older
01:54:28.480 white gentleman
01:54:29.280 and he just matter-of-factly says we're
01:54:31.199 sitting at his house
01:54:32.719 uh in malibu it's a nice day he's just
01:54:34.960 matter of fact
01:54:35.760 he says adidas will never put you on the
01:54:38.320 board
01:54:39.520 and i'm like this this wall
01:54:42.719 has to come down like how could you not
01:54:45.679 have the guy
01:54:46.960 that has the best idea so one of the
01:54:48.639 great things with universal one of the
01:54:50.800 approaches that we have is
01:54:52.239 you know universal when jimmy iveen and
01:54:54.960 dr dre
01:54:55.760 sold beats by dre uh universal had a
01:54:58.800 chance to buy in or do different things
01:55:02.480 they sold it for three billion dollars
01:55:03.840 that was half of the value
01:55:06.159 of universal at that time of six billion
01:55:08.239 due to the internet which
01:55:09.520 the music industry was afraid of in 2000
01:55:12.960 universal now i think is a
01:55:17.280 worth 33 bill 35 billion dollars
01:55:20.320 um and now they have another steve jobs
01:55:24.800 you know howard hughes henry iv disney
01:55:27.360 elon
01:55:28.400 kind of character within their midst
01:55:32.400 but they're so concerned about
01:55:35.840 the control of the idea of
01:55:38.960 artists because they're using me as like
01:55:40.719 this artist that has attracted other
01:55:43.199 artists
01:55:44.159 it also i use them i got famous i made
01:55:47.119 some money i got to tour
01:55:48.719 you know i became this superstar so we
01:55:50.719 use each other now this is just an
01:55:52.560 adjustment that needs to be made in the
01:55:53.920 relationship
01:55:55.040 and i can make and i will make products
01:55:58.000 that
01:55:59.360 will make more money than universal is
01:56:03.119 worth
01:56:03.840 but it's not about the money as i said
01:56:05.760 earlier it's about the fact
01:56:08.159 that even though my net worth is five
01:56:10.639 billion dollars
01:56:11.599 and i'm one of the most famous most
01:56:12.960 influential god-fearing
01:56:15.040 christians on the planet the
01:56:18.880 i still have to go to this man or this
01:56:21.840 organization
01:56:22.880 and ask him for something and that is
01:56:25.440 what it's about you can have a company
01:56:26.800 right
01:56:27.199 when you go and do your companies don't
01:56:28.480 think because you got the most ownership
01:56:30.400 that you actually have the control if
01:56:32.560 you don't have the information
01:56:34.239 and the knowledge of how the
01:56:36.080 distribution works
01:56:37.840 and you're not having that conversation
01:56:39.599 you don't have the control so what i did
01:56:41.360 in my organization
01:56:42.719 with universal with gap and with adidas
01:56:45.760 i told my lawyers my managers everything
01:56:48.159 no one can communicate
01:56:49.520 with these organizations except for me
01:56:51.760 you can give me advice
01:56:53.040 but they gotta talk to the boss which is
01:56:56.239 me
01:56:57.119 and right there you start to get the
01:56:59.920 information flow
01:57:00.960 i guess who's my cfo who me
01:57:05.040 so that means i do have the time i do
01:57:08.320 10 to 15 transactions
01:57:11.520 what i do is i pay because i had open
01:57:14.960 credit cards i had
01:57:16.880 checks you know i had people flying in
01:57:20.159 and out
01:57:20.719 i had a consultant agreements like
01:57:22.560 people who weren't on the salary but
01:57:24.159 they were consultants
01:57:25.119 i had you know uh
01:57:28.159 people paying for flights hotels cars
01:57:31.920 food netflix like
01:57:34.960 everything just running the account just
01:57:37.360 even right now
01:57:38.560 i cancel all my credit cards except for
01:57:40.639 one credit card this is like the oprah
01:57:42.719 winfrey moment where she's like
01:57:44.320 man when i started spending cash i was
01:57:46.159 like i really realized
01:57:48.000 you know how much i was spending and i
01:57:49.840 signed all my own checks and the thing
01:57:51.360 that happens in the music industry
01:57:52.960 uh is and just a lot of industries like
01:57:54.800 people tell you that someone needs to do
01:57:56.239 something for you
01:57:57.440 and it's like look this siri do
01:58:00.080 everything for you know you can do
01:58:01.679 it's possible and it's just when you ask
01:58:04.080 me how do i delegate my time
01:58:05.760 it's important for me to delegate my
01:58:07.920 time if i made
01:58:09.199 210 million dollars last year
01:58:12.320 and yeah i have a lot of maverick ideas
01:58:14.000 i'm working on cities and homeless
01:58:15.679 shelters and farms and i'm reinvesting
01:58:17.520 myself so a lot of
01:58:18.560 mavericks will you know spend their
01:58:20.719 money on their ideas and they'll invest
01:58:23.360 in what they see the future is and i
01:58:24.880 ended up with a net worth of 10 million
01:58:26.880 i remember
01:58:27.760 you know a few a month ago people were
01:58:30.320 like
01:58:30.960 you can't show your taxes because people
01:58:33.599 won't understand that you're a
01:58:34.719 billionaire
01:58:35.520 if they see that you only netted 10
01:58:37.280 million last year
01:58:39.280 and after the gap deal happened my net
01:58:42.239 worth
01:58:42.960 went from 3.3 billion
01:58:46.239 to 5 billion and i had been asking the
01:58:49.360 people around me
01:58:50.400 to run the story and they were going to
01:58:51.840 run it with bloomberg they never ran it
01:58:54.639 i was not afraid of people looking at me
01:58:57.040 like i was not a billionaire
01:58:58.639 and i said be honest show my taxes show
01:59:02.159 every
01:59:02.639 everything and then the reports came
01:59:04.639 back oh you're worth 5 billion
01:59:07.440 it came from me just being honest when i
01:59:10.800 want to say something about the gap deal
01:59:12.480 also and specifically the name the gap
01:59:14.080 in my
01:59:14.480 and my journey with that like at age 16
01:59:17.520 i worked at the gap i always saw the gap
01:59:19.360 as like being
01:59:20.400 the apple of apparel i always had this
01:59:23.119 comparison with siege i always felt like
01:59:24.960 i was the steve jobs
01:59:26.719 of the gap it was something about how
01:59:28.880 clean it was and what mickey drexler had
01:59:30.880 done
01:59:31.199 all these commercials and like you know
01:59:34.159 at age 16
01:59:35.440 i was uh working at the gap and i got
01:59:37.040 fired for stealing and i was actually
01:59:39.199 stealing khakis i was stealing khakis
01:59:40.800 from my friend
01:59:41.520 funny thing look i stole khakis for my
01:59:44.719 friend when i started doing music at age
01:59:47.840 19 18
01:59:48.639 i went and bought a chain i came home
01:59:52.080 one day
01:59:53.040 didn't see where the chain was come to
01:59:54.960 find out my friend was smoking crack and
01:59:57.280 it stole my
01:59:58.000 chain so the guy i was stealing for end
02:00:00.080 up stealing
02:00:02.080 from me um but um it's khakis i was
02:00:06.000 stealing some gap khakis i wanted those
02:00:07.520 khakis that bad
02:00:08.639 um so then 27 years later
02:00:11.760 you know i give my life to god
02:00:14.800 and i start doing sunday service one of
02:00:17.119 the things that
02:00:18.320 i had to do for sunday service or i got
02:00:20.639 to do that was fun for me to do
02:00:22.320 was to design the wardrobe for sunday
02:00:25.040 service and we would redesign
02:00:27.840 t-shirts and it says in the bible that
02:00:29.840 jesus wore a seamless garment so we
02:00:31.520 started
02:00:32.159 building t-shirts where the scene was
02:00:33.679 only here or only
02:00:36.000 two seams on the shirt or moving it
02:00:38.159 around and what the neck was
02:00:39.440 and i made t-shirt after t-shirt after
02:00:41.360 t-shirt and christianity we said we
02:00:42.880 stand in the gap
02:00:44.000 so watch this this opportunity is
02:00:46.960 presented
02:00:48.239 and i always had clothes that were kind
02:00:49.760 of chill like they could be at the gap
02:00:51.280 they were not overly fashionable
02:00:53.040 and god said you you you stood in the
02:00:56.719 gap
02:00:58.400 and i'm gonna have you stand in the gap
02:01:00.080 for real and i'm gonna give you favor
02:01:02.639 and increase and i know per some person
02:01:05.040 i know somebody where all that design
02:01:06.480 and t-shirts will come in handy
02:01:08.400 i literally was designing t-shirts for
02:01:10.639 sunday service
02:01:11.679 like david working out in the field
02:01:13.679 tending to the field
02:01:14.800 you know when goliath came uh they
02:01:17.679 wanted one of his brothers and the
02:01:19.119 warriors to
02:01:19.920 to go up against goliath and his father
02:01:22.400 chose
02:01:23.040 david and david said i don't need all
02:01:25.360 this armor
02:01:26.320 i just need these three smooth stones i
02:01:28.239 just need you know this is how i got to
02:01:30.000 see they didn't know david
02:01:31.199 had had to fight a lion and had to fight
02:01:33.599 a a bear
02:01:34.960 so god by him tending to the fill
02:01:38.000 in humility and in service to god and
02:01:40.800 honor to his family
02:01:42.320 he was able to have the skill set to
02:01:45.599 take down
02:01:46.639 goliath we hit the street you know it's
02:01:49.840 a term that i had to learn
02:01:51.360 wall street we hit the street like you
02:01:53.840 never ever saw it before
02:01:55.840 i used to be in san fran asking people
02:01:57.679 to invest in me nobody invested me
02:01:59.679 when i went to a wedding in san fran
02:02:01.360 with all these billionaires and
02:02:02.719 investors
02:02:03.280 angel investors you should have seen
02:02:04.880 people's faces they were like you
02:02:07.119 jumped from the three-point line you ran
02:02:09.360 a stock
02:02:10.239 by 45 percent you see think about this
02:02:12.800 you're gonna split the black vote
02:02:14.719 you can't vote for that you you're only
02:02:17.119 a rapper you're only it's like
02:02:18.719 all these things that diminish me yeah
02:02:20.880 and now it's like
02:02:22.080 deadpool like i came back as like a
02:02:24.400 superhero
02:02:25.199 and i won't let that be the kryptonite i
02:02:27.599 won't let my own ego
02:02:29.280 be my kryptonite i won't let other
02:02:30.960 people's opinions
02:02:32.320 be my kryptonite i won't let these
02:02:33.840 labels that people put on me
02:02:35.840 be my kryptonite and a lot of times i
02:02:38.000 don't like to watch these interviews
02:02:39.760 back until about you know three four
02:02:42.159 five years later because
02:02:43.599 i'm always you know i'm visiting the now
02:02:46.400 i'm existing in the future and visiting
02:02:48.159 the now
02:02:48.719 when i'm speaking to you and they make a
02:02:51.119 lot more sense
02:02:52.320 in the future because i can tell you but
02:02:54.639 he can show you
02:02:55.599 god can show you so a lot of stuff i'm
02:02:56.960 telling you and some people are
02:02:58.480 following me some people are believing
02:02:59.920 in it
02:03:00.480 and some people are just doubting it
02:03:02.800 because they want to put this label oh
02:03:04.239 he's crazy or
02:03:05.440 it's just a black guy saying it or it's
02:03:07.440 just a rapper
02:03:08.480 it's just a it's just an entertainer
02:03:10.800 it's just whatever it is
02:03:12.239 so i can say the most wild ideas out
02:03:15.599 loud it's like veronica corningstone
02:03:17.119 wanting to be an
02:03:17.840 anchor person and i remember she said so
02:03:21.280 ron i told you
02:03:22.480 i wanted to be a he said yes i heard you
02:03:24.719 i wrote it down
02:03:25.599 veronica corningston had a very funny
02:03:27.599 joke tonight and every time i talk
02:03:29.679 it's literally like veronica cornerstone
02:03:31.599 having a very funny joke tonight like
02:03:33.360 when i said i was gonna run for
02:03:34.239 president
02:03:34.880 that was like okay go ahead would you
02:03:36.960 like to interject
02:03:38.080 do you have thoughts and ideas also that
02:03:39.920 you'd like to have be a part of your
02:03:41.280 interview well you went from
02:03:43.280 you went from people mad at you that you
02:03:44.800 split in the back black vote
02:03:46.400 all the way to the gap and all the way
02:03:48.000 to veronica i made it
02:03:49.760 but then i brought it back yes you did
02:03:51.679 to the vote to run it for you
02:03:53.040 brought it back from to people doubting
02:03:55.520 you and people putting limitations on
02:03:57.199 you
02:03:57.679 people are tuning in this podcast to go
02:03:59.360 on the journey with us yeah
02:04:01.040 listen they do or they don't it's up to
02:04:03.119 them yeah but do you know
02:04:04.400 the beautiful thing is you're not
02:04:05.440 listening to these people these people
02:04:07.040 that are trying to
02:04:07.920 put these labels on you and tell you
02:04:09.360 what to do and
02:04:11.679 you're not saddled down by fear you're
02:04:14.400 not settled down by
02:04:15.679 doubt you're you're willing to take
02:04:17.280 these chances if you did become
02:04:19.119 president what would you do that was
02:04:20.560 different
02:04:23.119 i mean pretty much everything i was just
02:04:25.440 looking at the suits last night i was
02:04:26.960 like yo
02:04:27.500 [Laughter]
02:04:29.119 what would you redesign i don't wear
02:04:31.040 white anymore they had a white shirt you
02:04:33.040 know they had
02:04:33.599 like a i just
02:04:37.119 um i would i would
02:04:40.400 redesign this i i will and it's not a
02:04:42.639 wood right it's not a if
02:04:44.000 it's not a if it's just when right um
02:04:49.760 we got to start with the budget i feel
02:04:51.520 like
02:04:52.800 you know the fact that i went from being
02:04:54.719 in debt
02:04:56.159 to uh to
02:04:59.760 uh being i don't even like the way it
02:05:02.719 sounds the multi-billion because we
02:05:03.760 think about steve jobs money is like the
02:05:05.760 least
02:05:06.079 of what's awesome about him and the
02:05:08.960 money is just a tool like it's like
02:05:10.480 nails like i got the most names you feel
02:05:12.239 like it's scored on the scoreboard
02:05:14.000 though
02:05:14.480 it proves it proves not just value but
02:05:17.920 it proves
02:05:18.560 effectiveness yeah and it's like you're
02:05:20.480 crazy to your right so it proves in some
02:05:22.560 way that
02:05:23.199 a lot of the things i said that were
02:05:24.400 crazy i was actually right about yeah
02:05:26.480 looking at that budget and i think that
02:05:28.880 that's part of god's like
02:05:30.320 training like mr miyagi paint defense
02:05:33.040 you know karate kid
02:05:34.000 daniel son i on that i gave like the
02:05:37.280 full description of the
02:05:38.480 uh of the analogy just in case uh people
02:05:41.280 didn't um
02:05:42.000 what do you think you would do though if
02:05:43.520 they come to you with talks about
02:05:45.360 foreign policy people love talking about
02:05:47.520 foreign policy that's the number one uh
02:05:48.960 question yeah but when i talk about the
02:05:50.639 budget
02:05:52.000 you know this paint the fence the fact
02:05:54.239 that i had to
02:05:56.239 you know that i have to understand
02:06:00.880 300 million dollars of cash a year that
02:06:04.239 you don't get trained for that that's
02:06:05.760 like astronaut training that i have to
02:06:07.920 understand
02:06:08.719 how to have multiple industries that i
02:06:11.440 have to understand
02:06:12.560 how to build and
02:06:15.760 house and provide
02:06:19.119 you know i i provide people with health
02:06:21.440 care and i could
02:06:22.400 i had this idea of doing a zero employee
02:06:24.400 org where
02:06:25.760 i i put everything on my partners on
02:06:29.440 universal on the gap
02:06:30.880 on adidas but i believe this is amazing
02:06:34.239 training for me as a
02:06:35.440 a black person there's people who who
02:06:38.639 have been
02:06:39.760 raised to respect a penny but as a black
02:06:43.440 person
02:06:44.079 i've been raised to look down at a penny
02:06:46.960 but the people who really
02:06:48.400 hold their money respect every penny
02:06:51.199 they respect the money
02:06:52.880 and it's interesting i had an argument
02:06:54.800 with uh one of my managers because i
02:06:56.960 made my own travel ban
02:06:58.480 in my organization because you know i
02:07:01.199 did
02:07:01.599 when i did sunday service a month and a
02:07:02.960 half ago it was 25 flights coming in and
02:07:04.880 people i didn't know
02:07:06.159 because there's criminals in my
02:07:07.520 organization trying to kill bob marley
02:07:09.920 not to jfk or mlk me but deplete my
02:07:13.599 resources
02:07:15.599 so i created this travel explain that
02:07:17.599 what do you mean by that what i mean by
02:07:19.360 criminals in your organization like what
02:07:21.199 do you mean meaning
02:07:22.400 there's people that okay i fired this
02:07:25.360 one cfo
02:07:27.599 about three months ago and up to a week
02:07:30.159 ago he still had an open credit card
02:07:32.880 because i i'm gonna dig lower and dick
02:07:35.360 lower and go to it it's like always like
02:07:37.679 is this the new person that's in charge
02:07:39.199 of your money it's like no i'm the new
02:07:40.800 person
02:07:41.360 that's in charge of your money that's in
02:07:43.280 charge of my money rather
02:07:44.960 so so that's why you became your cfo
02:07:47.360 that's why i became and it's
02:07:48.560 it's the best and it's it clears my
02:07:50.639 thoughts and it really helps me
02:07:52.159 with design it helps me as i'm designing
02:07:55.360 uh uh designing uh what i'm doing at the
02:07:58.560 gap it helps me
02:07:59.840 when i'm how i'm designing the
02:08:02.400 curriculum it helps me
02:08:03.520 in the way i'm designing the kitchen the
02:08:05.360 way i'm delegating the way i'm working
02:08:07.119 the way i'm
02:08:07.760 and being a better leader being a better
02:08:10.960 uh being a better listener wait a second
02:08:13.599 but there was some question you had i
02:08:14.639 had i was answering
02:08:15.679 and i gave it all before you went to
02:08:17.520 foreign policies i went to the
02:08:18.960 the budget well i said it's like
02:08:20.880 danielson painting the fence
02:08:23.040 the fact that i've had to really look at
02:08:25.440 and understand
02:08:26.639 that kind of money and this god-given
02:08:29.360 anointing
02:08:30.400 being a producer being a head of
02:08:33.040 industry to be
02:08:34.560 a fearing and god and a servant of god
02:08:38.719 and a producer and head of industry at
02:08:41.199 the same time
02:08:43.040 is literally like the perfect
02:08:45.599 combination
02:08:47.040 for a president and to be honest i'm
02:08:50.159 literally like every now and then
02:08:52.159 america has to get america deserves the
02:08:55.760 world deserves
02:08:56.880 a leader that they can 100 percent
02:09:00.320 trust that whatever i'm saying
02:09:04.159 to you with the information that i have
02:09:06.719 in front of me
02:09:07.760 i 100 believe that
02:09:11.280 like when i talked to the uh when i was
02:09:13.760 with the president of haiti
02:09:15.440 and he gave us an island me and shervin
02:09:18.560 pisivar
02:09:19.440 that was an early angel investor at uber
02:09:22.239 and is working on the uh
02:09:23.760 the virgin hyperloop right now a really
02:09:26.639 great friend of mine he saved me
02:09:28.320 he's had me avoid deals where i was
02:09:30.639 gonna give up a percentage of my company
02:09:32.639 for a third of the value and different
02:09:34.239 things like that
02:09:35.119 so uh we go to haiti and the president
02:09:38.239 uh uh gives us this island to develop
02:09:41.920 uh to make a city of the future and also
02:09:45.280 we're gonna have the farmers and the
02:09:47.440 people who live there
02:09:48.560 take a percentage i mean take ownership
02:09:50.960 of the land that they have right now so
02:09:52.079 when it raises in value
02:09:54.239 they all eat off of uh what the idea is
02:09:58.000 but he said that um
02:10:02.079 the way that he has done uh business
02:10:04.880 with our president
02:10:06.079 is so straightforward
02:10:09.119 i believe that i know that me as
02:10:11.599 president would be the best thing that
02:10:13.440 ever happened for america's
02:10:15.040 foreign policy i've traveled more than
02:10:17.360 any president
02:10:18.639 already and i bring people together i
02:10:21.360 put rivals
02:10:22.880 on songs together to create masterpieces
02:10:26.159 i go and i empathize when i meet with
02:10:28.880 leaders
02:10:29.599 in africa when i meet with leaders in
02:10:32.639 um i didn't really have a good uh next
02:10:35.920 thing i wanted to sound good and like
02:10:37.360 naming
02:10:38.079 leaders and i wanted to sound
02:10:41.330 [Laughter]
02:10:47.280 see honestly so when i when i meet with
02:10:49.360 when i meet with leaders
02:10:50.800 i'm not trying to go in there and see
02:10:52.639 how they can use my internet i'm not
02:10:54.719 trying to go in there and buy up their
02:10:56.639 land
02:10:57.280 and develop it and buy it up for cheap
02:11:00.639 you know we're we're going to share
02:11:03.040 information
02:11:04.079 you know we're uh you know we have
02:11:07.199 a idea we just had of a dual citizenship
02:11:10.320 for
02:11:11.119 americans with african uh dissent uh
02:11:14.880 that the ability to create
02:11:18.079 environments and communities completely
02:11:20.239 can change
02:11:21.440 the way uh
02:11:24.880 people act you know if people are hungry
02:11:27.040 they're gonna act a certain way
02:11:28.320 people have food they're gonna act a
02:11:29.840 certain way people are away from their
02:11:31.280 friends and family they're gonna act a
02:11:32.400 certain way they're gonna need to
02:11:33.920 they're at a college town they need to
02:11:35.520 stop by this you know frat party and you
02:11:38.079 know
02:11:38.480 drink and do the but when they're uh
02:11:41.679 you know but you got to go here so then
02:11:43.440 you could go there and like society is
02:11:45.040 all about
02:11:45.679 dismantling the family i see things
02:11:48.079 being more like a kibbutz or
02:11:50.560 you know where the family can be as
02:11:52.079 close and when the grandparents can be
02:11:54.000 next to the children and um you know
02:11:56.719 these
02:11:57.199 ideas i have about um
02:12:00.320 how communities uh ca should be
02:12:03.840 are worldwide simplified ideas and that
02:12:06.480 they're not based on
02:12:08.000 industry even though i understand
02:12:09.440 industry they're based on serving god
02:12:12.000 and serving families and that's
02:12:14.480 something that
02:12:15.840 everyone across the globe no matter what
02:12:18.800 country in the world whatever
02:12:19.920 continental world
02:12:21.199 all of the moms and dads have something
02:12:23.119 in common they want the world to be
02:12:24.639 better for their children
02:12:26.159 we all want the world to be better for
02:12:28.400 the children
02:12:29.440 and we can show ways that we are not at
02:12:32.480 odds think about the world is a
02:12:34.079 giant piano but we're playing off-key
02:12:38.000 so for a producer to synthesize those
02:12:40.880 ideas
02:12:41.760 and not say okay we're gonna shut i
02:12:43.840 spent time in china
02:12:45.119 i spent a year in china when i was uh in
02:12:48.159 fifth grade i used to speak
02:12:49.679 chinese like new york like i
02:12:52.800 i don't know a lot of yeah my mom was an
02:12:55.360 english
02:12:55.920 professor they had an exchange program
02:12:57.520 where a chinese student could
02:12:59.280 come to america and she could go to
02:13:01.520 which was there was
02:13:02.800 like chinese at that time couldn't come
02:13:04.719 to america
02:13:06.000 as uh as easily so
02:13:10.320 you know there's america's greatest
02:13:14.560 export is influence and
02:13:18.239 culture china actually has like
02:13:21.360 imitation paris imitation they probably
02:13:23.280 got imitation calabasas at this
02:13:25.199 they probably do at this point you know
02:13:28.719 the the artists define culture that's
02:13:31.440 what makes there's the artist
02:13:32.960 that made the design the statue of
02:13:35.280 liberty
02:13:36.079 there's an artist that designed the
02:13:38.239 eiffel tower
02:13:39.599 this is the reason why i donated 100
02:13:42.320 million dollars to james terrell's
02:13:44.079 rodent crater uh uh
02:13:47.119 project when i went to this is like the
02:13:49.599 eighth
02:13:50.800 wonder of the world but i saw spaces
02:13:54.639 that we can exist in that would be
02:13:57.520 helpful
02:13:58.159 for our health our well-being these are
02:14:00.880 healthier
02:14:01.679 places for us to be we need to be like
02:14:04.719 almost like turalyon's like our our life
02:14:06.480 is like a shakespearean
02:14:08.000 uh like shakespeare has written 30
02:14:09.679 percent of uh
02:14:11.119 our language that we use like i say like
02:14:13.599 he must have been a really nice person
02:14:15.360 like
02:14:15.760 davinci used to walk away from people
02:14:17.440 when he would talk to people and that's
02:14:19.040 but that's the reason why it's the da
02:14:20.159 vinci code and at the da vinci
02:14:21.840 life because he never was able to get it
02:14:24.880 across to the
02:14:26.000 to the to the level to affect us for
02:14:28.159 generations to come
02:14:29.599 these people love art but they want to
02:14:31.679 put art in the box
02:14:33.119 we need to surround ourselves with the
02:14:35.040 artist because the artists
02:14:36.719 are the the most connected
02:14:40.320 the most truthful and their dinosaur
02:14:43.840 never got killed
02:14:45.119 somehow the people who have figured out
02:14:47.119 how to make a
02:14:48.159 real a living off of art is what do you
02:14:50.480 mean by the dinosaur never got killed
02:14:52.840 meaning art class
02:14:56.320 would be considered to be fun like every
02:14:58.400 kid loves to draw
02:14:59.440 yeah right but some people got to grow
02:15:01.440 up and like the artists
02:15:03.920 right in some way don't have to yes like
02:15:07.360 this separate we're all children we're
02:15:09.520 all if you're if you're alive
02:15:11.679 you're a child we're all children in
02:15:13.199 god's eyes and we're all young
02:15:14.800 people like jesus is a old person like
02:15:17.360 he's oh
02:15:18.239 like you know like adam is old
02:15:22.880 you know if you're alive you're you're
02:15:25.760 young
02:15:26.239 and we're like children and there's all
02:15:28.560 these things these sharp edges these
02:15:30.159 corners these anxieties these fears
02:15:31.920 these things put in our
02:15:33.119 our food our diet our diet of what we
02:15:35.679 consume right here
02:15:36.960 that turn us old and make us brittle and
02:15:39.920 make us
02:15:40.800 uh put that fear on our kids don't you
02:15:42.719 put that evil on me ricky bobby they put
02:15:44.639 that
02:15:45.119 they put that we put these evils on our
02:15:48.719 children we put racism
02:15:50.239 on our children we put fear on our
02:15:52.239 children and the the children are
02:15:54.320 fearless the children
02:15:55.599 it's it's funny it's like claudio
02:15:57.280 sylvestre one of our lead architects i
02:15:59.199 worked with since
02:16:00.239 uh age 24 he built this home in my
02:16:02.880 oracle with john with john
02:16:04.079 paulson and he has like this golf
02:16:07.520 course which it's in the acoustics are
02:16:10.000 incredible
02:16:10.719 but it's this part where you can walk
02:16:12.079 along that's 20 feet high
02:16:14.400 and i said you know would you you know
02:16:17.599 what about the kids what
02:16:18.719 you know you have a balcony you have a
02:16:19.920 banister or something and he looked at
02:16:21.440 me and said
02:16:22.000 they're smarter than we think
02:16:25.119 wow and meaning like if we were never
02:16:28.400 taught
02:16:29.199 the missing banister theory that
02:16:32.318 we could all tightrope walk the missing
02:16:35.280 banister theory i wrote it in my book
02:16:36.959 thank you and you're welcome that i
02:16:38.000 wrote with my friend sakaya that's
02:16:39.840 actually here right now that's uh
02:16:41.280 uh that you were talking to earlier is
02:16:43.840 look you could walk down a straight line
02:16:46.000 without worrying about anything uh but
02:16:49.120 you take that exact straight line and
02:16:50.478 put it 20 story high
02:16:51.920 20 stories high you know i'm going with
02:16:53.840 it yeah and you remove the balconies
02:16:55.679 you're going to be so concerned about
02:16:57.840 the idea of falling that it will make
02:16:59.599 you fall yep
02:17:01.040 and that's where the superpower is in
02:17:03.200 removing the fear
02:17:04.478 yes that's a beautiful thing to say
02:17:06.718 right there
02:17:07.599 and it's also probably the first sound
02:17:09.200 biteable thing that i've said the entire
02:17:15.519 all right let me talk to you about so
02:17:18.240 we're serious here so let's talk about
02:17:19.920 like real
02:17:20.638 presidential issues let's talk about
02:17:23.040 like here's
02:17:24.080 here's some things that just when we
02:17:26.318 talk about this country
02:17:27.599 here's some things that are that mean a
02:17:29.040 lot to me one student debt
02:17:31.439 i think it's crazy i think it's crazy
02:17:33.599 that we take children
02:17:35.280 when they're 17 18 years old we send
02:17:37.359 them way to college
02:17:38.398 we make them literally hundreds of
02:17:39.920 thousands of dollars in debt and then we
02:17:41.679 ask them to go out into the world
02:17:43.519 and try to manage this money and and try
02:17:46.398 to get a job that's going to pay them a
02:17:47.840 fraction of what they owe
02:17:49.280 for their education i think it's crazy i
02:17:51.040 think we should figure out a way to
02:17:52.240 absolve student debt
02:17:53.519 i think we should figure out a way to
02:17:54.959 make education
02:17:56.799 at the very least far less expensive
02:17:59.200 than it is now
02:18:00.718 this is this is a big issue for people
02:18:02.558 absolutely i'm i'm completely confident
02:18:05.200 that i will figure out how to get
02:18:08.478 america out of debt
02:18:10.000 that i have the ability once i see
02:18:13.280 everything i never make the wrong
02:18:15.679 decision
02:18:17.519 when i'm giving all the information
02:18:19.120 that's my that's my skill set anything i
02:18:20.959 go into
02:18:21.840 producing rap homes
02:18:25.760 clothing anything once i'm given the
02:18:29.200 right information
02:18:30.240 i apply my taste and i have the best
02:18:33.120 taste
02:18:34.000 on the planet i mean quincy jones
02:18:36.160 there's a couple people that's like
02:18:38.478 okay crazy don't taste might be better
02:18:40.080 than mine but if quincy could you
02:18:41.519 imagine quincy jones
02:18:42.879 as a president i could yeah
02:18:46.240 or uh walt disney uh steve jobs like
02:18:49.840 maybe some of these personalities are a
02:18:51.840 little volatile yeah yeah but that's how
02:18:54.000 he gets things done
02:18:55.040 yeah like for america to be as
02:18:59.359 warming and inviting as as as disney
02:19:02.638 world
02:19:03.120 there used to be you know this dream of
02:19:05.840 you know people still have this dream of
02:19:07.200 coming to them
02:19:08.000 they're coming to america like it's
02:19:11.599 the america that i grew up even with
02:19:13.439 like when ronald reagan
02:19:14.959 was in office it's like he was hanging
02:19:17.280 out with michael jackson
02:19:18.558 and you know it's like it felt america
02:19:21.679 plus the way the media showed things
02:19:23.920 like the american dream
02:19:25.920 was alive and well and
02:19:29.519 even at the same time in in the ghetto
02:19:31.840 it was a living hell and we were being
02:19:34.000 you know given you know bricks were put
02:19:37.280 on the street
02:19:38.558 uh bricks are pulled on the street doing
02:19:40.160 the riots now bricks are putting on the
02:19:41.599 street
02:19:42.240 in eighties a different kind of brick
02:19:44.398 and there were guns placed
02:19:46.240 and the fathers were being taken out of
02:19:48.318 the hood and this is all this so don't
02:19:50.160 let me say like
02:19:51.520 everything was perfect doing that um
02:19:54.560 doing that era but the perception right
02:19:56.960 now perception is more important than
02:19:58.880 it's
02:19:59.280 ever than it's ever been like what we
02:20:02.720 show you know it's just i mean it's
02:20:06.080 outright
02:20:07.920 it's it's just uh i don't even wanna i
02:20:10.880 don't wanna i don't know i don't wanna
02:20:12.160 dwell on it let's keep going into what
02:20:13.439 you're saying about the debt because
02:20:15.040 also i don't have
02:20:16.080 like if you ask me about covet i can
02:20:18.240 only give you my perspective as a
02:20:19.920 civilian
02:20:21.439 i don't i'm not talking to these the
02:20:24.399 same people
02:20:25.520 you know and i also empower the geniuses
02:20:28.960 i was talking to my man uh fred and my
02:20:32.319 boy anthony
02:20:33.439 about crypto and bitcoin you know the
02:20:37.840 uh yesterday just to be prepped for this
02:20:39.920 conversation and not about the specifics
02:20:42.399 of alternate currencies which is like ac
02:20:46.240 which is like tesla which is like but
02:20:48.080 the uh this that my mind just goes on
02:20:49.840 these like riffs right here
02:20:51.040 but uh jack dorsey decentralized twitter
02:20:55.840 two months before it really hit because
02:20:57.520 he was talking to
02:20:59.280 the bitcoin guys and these are guys that
02:21:01.520 really have a perspective on what
02:21:03.359 the true liberation of america and
02:21:05.359 humanity will be
02:21:06.800 these guys a lot of the the specifically
02:21:09.920 these guys but a lot of the tech guys
02:21:12.000 were able to use the new highways the
02:21:14.880 new information highways
02:21:16.319 and create the next frontier of our
02:21:18.960 existence
02:21:20.000 while the powers of our
02:21:23.040 uh political system are still
02:21:26.080 anchoring on electoral college
02:21:29.359 which was based around slavery about the
02:21:32.640 idea
02:21:33.680 of slaves being three-fifths of man and
02:21:35.920 get this
02:21:37.520 it wasn't even created by pro slaves
02:21:41.680 three-fifths of man was created by the
02:21:44.319 anti-slaves in the north
02:21:46.319 as a compromise and that basically
02:21:49.040 explains
02:21:49.920 the existence of black people in america
02:21:51.920 to to this
02:21:53.200 day the people that were on our side
02:21:55.840 supposedly said we were three-fifths of
02:21:57.680 men
02:21:59.120 the people that were on our side the
02:22:01.840 people
02:22:02.319 on our side thought of us as
02:22:04.880 three-fifths of man meaning like
02:22:06.399 yeah come work for us but you know
02:22:09.520 you're three fifths of men sitting you
02:22:10.720 have electoral college
02:22:12.640 and gerrymandering happening to this
02:22:14.880 date where if you have
02:22:16.720 uh uh latinos uh
02:22:19.760 uh blacks other minorities they're
02:22:22.760 redrawing
02:22:24.560 the lines to affect the vote
02:22:27.760 to this day that does not relate to the
02:22:31.040 information highway that we live in
02:22:32.720 today that allow
02:22:34.640 all these you know tech guys to become
02:22:37.120 multi-billionaires and lead
02:22:38.800 uh and and and and
02:22:42.160 lead free thought or allow you know as
02:22:44.800 best as we could a version of free
02:22:46.479 thought
02:22:46.960 i i know i gave you a symphony but you
02:22:48.960 see how all this
02:22:50.479 really connects we're sticking you know
02:22:52.800 why don't we just keep
02:22:53.680 why don't we why don't we put the white
02:22:55.200 wigs back on they still wear the white
02:22:56.720 wigs down uh
02:22:58.160 yeah england they still wear it you know
02:23:00.000 that's the whole thing just because
02:23:02.000 you know someone's not you know wearing
02:23:05.040 uh uh uh a kkk
02:23:08.080 uh uniform or a white wig doesn't mean
02:23:10.560 that they aren't holding on
02:23:12.160 to the very core of the
02:23:15.520 the country being uh you know uh based
02:23:18.800 on
02:23:19.120 and built off of slavery so when
02:23:21.439 everyone's saying
02:23:22.319 vote you know that's the reason why my
02:23:23.600 mercy is vote kanye because like
02:23:26.720 vote for who look man if you ain't gonna
02:23:30.080 say who you voting on out loud don't
02:23:31.840 even wear the vote t-shirt that's so
02:23:33.840 random
02:23:34.880 right that's so rare and we always know
02:23:36.720 voters like democrat and stuff because
02:23:38.560 there's nobody is that trump that's like
02:23:40.479 wears a vote t-shirt isn't that funny
02:23:42.560 but it's such a go ahead if you do say
02:23:44.800 that yeah you say
02:23:45.680 vote is mostly vote democrat like and if
02:23:48.399 you have an american flag
02:23:50.000 mostly you're voting trump like these
02:23:52.479 are these are
02:23:53.359 realities that we've sort of accepted
02:23:54.800 and it's subs it's all this subliminal
02:23:56.960 stuff that's that's based on like fear
02:23:58.960 and control even like this like this
02:24:01.600 look at this
02:24:02.720 the whole this is the three-fifths of
02:24:04.000 man thing right okay
02:24:08.800 the democrats were willing to take the
02:24:12.840 chance of not
02:24:14.479 winning as long as the conglomerate
02:24:17.439 could be completely
02:24:18.640 in control of
02:24:21.920 as completely in control you know what
02:24:24.080 i'm saying that bernie
02:24:25.359 yeah bernie would have won he would have
02:24:27.920 won this is something
02:24:28.960 i wore a trumpet i'm saying like bernie
02:24:31.520 is a superhero
02:24:32.720 yeah you know and he would be the
02:24:35.680 perfect
02:24:36.960 the perfect and the perfect person to be
02:24:40.080 the opposite of what trump represents
02:24:42.080 yeah he's an anti-capitalist he's a is a
02:24:44.479 guy who's a social democrat
02:24:46.240 and you and but you know the problem
02:24:48.479 they couldn't control bernie
02:24:50.319 because you can't you can't control him
02:24:52.000 he's been so consistent in his whole
02:24:53.760 life
02:24:54.399 so so what i'm saying is they literally
02:24:56.399 kicked if this doesn't say something
02:24:58.560 it's like
02:24:59.200 they kicked the superhero you know
02:25:01.280 saying they they
02:25:02.240 well they wanted control it's the same
02:25:03.520 thing they did with tulsi gabbard but
02:25:05.359 bernie was interesting because he's this
02:25:07.040 democratic socialist because he's got
02:25:08.880 these ideas that are scary to capitalism
02:25:11.520 you know it's funny because i i created
02:25:13.359 the birthday party which
02:25:15.280 on the on the next selection what's
02:25:16.960 going to happen is i mean you guys got
02:25:19.200 300 million viewers you know after this
02:25:21.680 it'll probably be 900 million because
02:25:23.120 you know i run a stock up you know
02:25:25.359 you just do a little bit of bill cosby
02:25:27.040 in that neck
02:25:32.240 the uh no doubt jello pudding
02:25:36.479 exactly exactly so uh
02:25:40.160 so this is a long rant but i really
02:25:42.319 would like to talk to you about specific
02:25:43.840 things
02:25:44.240 okay i mean it was a beautiful long
02:25:45.760 symphony but there's a there's a cap on
02:25:47.600 it there's a pop
02:25:48.560 we don't we don't we don't we don't want
02:25:50.399 to catch up
02:26:01.280 but there's a possibility that i could
02:26:04.840 um it's actually technically possible
02:26:07.520 for me to win
02:26:09.439 now which would be the best option for
02:26:11.920 america
02:26:13.040 i would uh i'm i'm on uh 12 ballots
02:26:16.560 and in 17 states that you could write me
02:26:19.200 in on so if people
02:26:20.479 got up people that never voted uh got up
02:26:23.920 registered voted for me they'd have to
02:26:27.040 take it
02:26:28.080 take it to the house because
02:26:31.520 i would you know i could possibly win
02:26:32.960 now i'm definitely 100 winning in 2024
02:26:36.640 and with that thought i was like okay i
02:26:39.200 got the birthday party but i was
02:26:40.640 thinking
02:26:43.920 maybe there's a possibility i would be
02:26:50.560 they said that wouldn't happen i was
02:26:52.240 thinking i would you know
02:26:53.840 possibly be the democrat you know i
02:26:56.880 don't think they would ever let you in
02:26:58.160 like that
02:26:58.800 but i don't know maybe who knows what
02:27:00.640 happens after this joe biden kamala
02:27:02.640 harris thing
02:27:03.760 who knows he knows what they think you
02:27:05.520 know some you i would be the first
02:27:08.800 i'm
02:27:13.520 i'm trying i'm not trying to i'm one of
02:27:16.479 the
02:27:18.720 first
02:27:22.479 super famous public black
02:27:25.520 free will uh
02:27:28.880 servants of christ uh since
02:27:32.240 modern media has come to pass meaning
02:27:37.200 when i when i when i talk i'm not
02:27:39.040 talking for a conglomerate
02:27:40.960 i'm talking for myself in service to god
02:27:45.840 that's it that's it like i'm not
02:27:49.040 you know i'll cover my people cover my
02:27:52.319 family
02:27:53.600 but there's not some big plan or like
02:27:56.720 some practice script thing where it says
02:27:59.200 you go in and you you say this
02:28:02.240 you you do this we we've got we want to
02:28:04.720 keep
02:28:05.439 uh selling kodak film so we want to stop
02:28:09.359 you know you from bringing out the
02:28:10.720 digital camera we want to keep you know
02:28:12.479 selling this
02:28:13.359 raising the price of gas so we're not
02:28:15.920 going to look to
02:28:16.880 how to like safely harness nuclear power
02:28:19.040 or to do electric power
02:28:20.640 okay go ahead ask another question i
02:28:22.560 really just
02:28:24.720 i quite love the sound of my own voice
02:28:26.240 as you can see apparently uh
02:28:28.160 it's okay so it's this microphone we
02:28:30.479 started it sounds great
02:28:32.560 so we started with student debt and we
02:28:34.960 got we got on this long symphony
02:28:36.880 yeah um have you given thought into the
02:28:39.840 idea of free education
02:28:41.760 and particularly here's a big one for me
02:28:43.920 as well free health care
02:28:45.280 i think if we think of ourselves as a
02:28:47.120 country and
02:28:48.319 our country as a community we're all a
02:28:50.640 bunch of people
02:28:51.520 that are together if we're going to take
02:28:53.200 care of things like the fire department
02:28:55.359 if we're going to take care of things
02:28:56.319 like the police department education
02:28:59.200 we've got to take care of health care we
02:29:01.040 got we got to make it so that people get
02:29:03.040 sick they don't go bankrupt
02:29:04.720 we got to make it so that no one has to
02:29:06.560 worry about being taken
02:29:08.080 care of and i i and i don't mean
02:29:11.200 to eliminate the ability for someone to
02:29:13.920 hire a private specialist for surgery or
02:29:16.000 anything like that
02:29:16.880 i'm not i'm not saying that but i'm
02:29:18.720 saying at the very least we have to
02:29:20.800 cover
02:29:21.520 base medical concerns for the population
02:29:24.640 it's just
02:29:25.280 it's an a giant part of what what it is
02:29:28.319 to be a person
02:29:29.359 is to to worry about your your body
02:29:31.680 being broken to worry about being sick
02:29:33.840 to worry about what this is going to
02:29:35.760 cost your family financially and how it
02:29:37.280 could ruin people
02:29:38.479 this is a i mean this is a huge issue in
02:29:40.240 our country is
02:29:42.160 medical health so have you thought about
02:29:45.200 that
02:29:45.760 absolutely i i hear you and i feel you
02:29:49.359 and i feel what people are going through
02:29:50.880 i think that
02:29:53.280 there is a it's not just
02:29:56.880 how we treat people there's preventative
02:29:59.680 measures yes
02:30:00.880 that can help us from getting sick our
02:30:03.920 our diet our
02:30:05.200 our locations are our the our our jobs
02:30:08.880 there's a lot of that
02:30:09.920 that affects us and puts us in those uh
02:30:12.960 situation transportation you know like
02:30:15.920 as you go into like autonomous uh
02:30:18.399 vehicles and tram systems like just kind
02:30:20.800 of
02:30:21.760 you know trains that are like uh
02:30:24.720 floating malls or floating
02:30:26.240 uh starbucks or something like movement
02:30:28.880 like designing
02:30:30.560 our world to be the world of the future
02:30:33.040 will
02:30:34.000 uh will help us with health that's the
02:30:36.399 preventative message and then as far as
02:30:38.640 uh being more inventive in the way we um
02:30:42.560 we connect uh holistic uh
02:30:46.160 medicine with modern medicine i believe
02:30:49.359 in both
02:30:50.240 medicines i believe in god i believe in
02:30:53.920 god and nature i believe
02:30:57.520 in uh science
02:31:00.880 and physics and you know it's like
02:31:04.720 the first simplest form of
02:31:06.040 bioengineering uh
02:31:08.880 i think is farming and to
02:31:14.080 be able to have like i talk about the
02:31:18.080 the guys at mit the greatest scientists
02:31:20.560 in the world there's people who
02:31:22.319 are that are like the elons
02:31:26.240 of the the medical field but perhaps
02:31:29.439 they're sitting there on the on on the
02:31:32.319 floors like
02:31:33.200 serving on the front line fighting covet
02:31:36.560 uh where you know they didn't have the
02:31:38.720 opportunity to
02:31:40.160 create paypal and become a billionaire
02:31:42.640 and go to the
02:31:43.840 next idea or when they present it and
02:31:46.080 want people to invest
02:31:47.520 in these inventions that they have they
02:31:49.840 haven't had the voice of the platform
02:31:52.080 to bring this invention there's cures to
02:31:54.000 things like one of the things is the
02:31:55.359 silver bullet
02:31:56.080 like what what i went through with the
02:31:57.439 medication when they gave me the
02:31:58.800 medication
02:31:59.840 that made me fat but then they said okay
02:32:02.000 we have one
02:32:03.040 that doesn't we we all know what a
02:32:05.840 silver bullet is in medication right
02:32:07.520 so it's the um it's a medication that
02:32:10.479 goes and just kills exactly what it's
02:32:12.080 supposed to kill
02:32:13.040 but for capitalism
02:32:16.800 that's not the best medication to
02:32:19.200 actually cure people
02:32:21.280 capitalists want to keep people they
02:32:23.680 want to treat them they want to treat
02:32:25.040 they want to keep you sick
02:32:26.080 because that's how you you keep making
02:32:27.760 money to have a guy
02:32:29.600 like for me when i say i put my life on
02:32:31.200 the line i think about abraham lincoln i
02:32:32.880 think about
02:32:33.760 jfk to go in and sit and say
02:32:37.280 you know the whole thing is no everyone
02:32:39.680 is going to be more prosperous i think
02:32:41.439 is the word
02:32:42.160 not specifically are you going to 5x
02:32:44.479 your money everyone's like
02:32:45.760 trying to get no it's about prosperity
02:32:48.160 and to be able to
02:32:49.359 really have real conversations with
02:32:52.640 the lead heads of like big pharm
02:32:55.760 and real conversations with the heads of
02:32:58.960 uh of of uh holistic
02:33:02.720 and and natural healing to put these
02:33:04.800 people in a room together people aren't
02:33:06.880 even having
02:33:07.359 they're mad at each other they're afraid
02:33:09.040 of each other uh
02:33:10.640 i i i donated to a christian school in
02:33:13.760 cody
02:33:14.800 and um i also
02:33:17.920 went by and saw this other amazing
02:33:20.319 school
02:33:21.120 in uh in cody where they have
02:33:24.240 uh autistic children and kids with
02:33:26.960 special needs in the same
02:33:28.720 classrooms as uh
02:33:31.760 other as regular kids and
02:33:35.280 i just saw this juxtaposition and the
02:33:37.439 head of that that
02:33:38.800 school is uh a christian but
02:33:42.640 it's a state school so there's no prayer
02:33:45.600 in the school and then the other school
02:33:47.920 is fully christian
02:33:49.200 but it's not a state school so they
02:33:50.720 don't have money in the school
02:33:52.960 and i wanted to have dinner with
02:33:56.160 uh both of the principals come to find
02:33:59.520 out
02:34:01.439 the principal and these guys they talk
02:34:04.160 maybe at a
02:34:04.960 softball game or something the principal
02:34:08.479 house is one block walking distance
02:34:12.000 the principle of one schools houses one
02:34:13.840 block walking distance from the school
02:34:15.600 or the other
02:34:16.000 principal that we're this close
02:34:19.200 right now we have the solutions but we
02:34:22.319 all have our backs to each other
02:34:24.319 we need to face each other and like how
02:34:26.240 we're facing each other right now
02:34:27.680 and have these conversations the
02:34:29.920 solutions for
02:34:31.040 utopia are in front of us but what's
02:34:34.160 holding us back
02:34:35.600 fear people are sitting on their money
02:34:39.040 really they're sitting under their money
02:34:40.640 i know i'm gonna give you a thing okay
02:34:42.240 that's it next one
02:34:46.720 did you get did you get my perspective
02:34:48.319 of the real the way i would approach
02:34:50.160 you would bring people together to
02:34:51.920 communicate and try to figure out a
02:34:53.200 better strategy for health care
02:34:55.040 yeah i mean and and in reality some
02:34:57.280 financial realities that have to be
02:34:59.280 in london when you go to the hospital
02:35:04.640 no let me give you the american example
02:35:06.399 when i go to the hospital i had
02:35:07.840 something wrong on my foot
02:35:09.520 three years ago they asked me you know
02:35:12.399 do you want to take
02:35:13.200 something do you want a pill i said no
02:35:16.319 five doctors and nurses ask me if i want
02:35:19.280 a pill
02:35:20.000 this is like worse than when you don't
02:35:21.520 accept water on the plane and they just
02:35:23.200 keep like do you want some more water
02:35:24.880 i'll take the water all right because i
02:35:26.160 don't want to be responsible for the
02:35:27.680 water like when the plane takes off and
02:35:29.040 it goes like this and i gotta like hold
02:35:30.560 it in my
02:35:31.120 i don't want no water like i don't
02:35:37.680 even know my like masseuse said i should
02:35:39.200 drink more water uh
02:35:40.800 so the so they
02:35:43.840 they there are like people they have
02:35:46.240 christmas parties about bonuses about
02:35:48.080 giving out more
02:35:49.280 medication so we talk about they do look
02:35:52.000 at this
02:35:52.399 how much does the earth cost exactly
02:35:54.880 there's no price on it right
02:35:56.319 we make money money's not even backed by
02:35:58.080 gold anymore so
02:36:00.640 it's engineering it's where the budgets
02:36:03.439 are going
02:36:04.319 and like it was the best part on uh one
02:36:06.800 of the best parts on the sixth sense
02:36:08.800 is when um
02:36:11.840 when they looked at this video and it
02:36:13.280 was a nanny
02:36:14.960 uh they saw that the nanny was like
02:36:16.560 putting stuff in like the porch for the
02:36:18.160 child that had passed
02:36:19.359 and he and then they said the ladies
02:36:22.160 looked at the nanny and said you were
02:36:23.280 keeping her sick
02:36:25.120 you're keeping her sick like we are sick
02:36:29.600 we are sick uh abortion culture
02:36:33.359 sex culture uh capitalism we are sick
02:36:37.600 we as a people as a not just the
02:36:40.560 american society of the world we are
02:36:42.560 sick and we are keeping ourselves sick
02:36:45.920 we're
02:36:46.240 all responsible like the black mirror
02:36:48.560 episode we're all responsible
02:36:50.800 in some way we all play some part like
02:36:53.760 if i go to
02:36:54.800 pornhub in the very next thing
02:36:58.160 um and i uh and like backslide and do
02:37:02.160 this because i struggle with this since
02:37:04.080 i was like five years old right
02:37:05.920 and the very next thing says something
02:37:08.319 about
02:37:09.200 like trafficking
02:37:12.479 then i literally would have to like put
02:37:14.479 my hand over that part
02:37:16.319 and like click the thing i'm going to
02:37:18.479 and thinking that like i'm not
02:37:20.080 a part of the the bigger conglomerate
02:37:22.479 that we're all
02:37:23.200 oh i'm not really a part of the main
02:37:25.120 problem because i'm i'm not as bad as
02:37:26.720 that guy and i'm not looking at this
02:37:28.000 part and i'm not like
02:37:29.120 we all play a part of it then we're all
02:37:32.000 sick in some way and the world has been
02:37:33.520 designed to keep
02:37:34.720 us sick like spatial
02:37:38.160 engineering based off faith
02:37:41.520 can save a world literally like building
02:37:44.960 will save the world spatial engineering
02:37:47.760 like
02:37:49.120 engineering not going to space
02:37:51.439 engineering our spaces the amount of
02:37:53.520 space that we need
02:37:54.640 the way that we interact with each other
02:37:56.319 how close we are to our loved ones
02:37:58.560 our families how close we are to our
02:38:00.319 jobs we got to experience a lot of this
02:38:02.000 some people
02:38:02.800 it wasn't good some people it's better
02:38:04.880 they were connected with their children
02:38:06.960 and their families in a whole different
02:38:09.040 way like we're talking
02:38:10.640 this is my thing we could talk about all
02:38:13.120 of these important
02:38:14.560 current issues there's
02:38:18.080 deeper reasons based on the slave
02:38:20.240 mentality based on fear
02:38:22.399 based on protectionism not specifically
02:38:24.720 white supremacy and racism
02:38:26.479 protectionism people just want to
02:38:28.640 protect what they have and there's this
02:38:30.720 like
02:38:31.200 photograph where you're holding um the
02:38:34.160 guys
02:38:34.640 the little girls holding a teddy bear
02:38:36.319 and jesus has a giant teddy bear
02:38:38.560 behind her um her back
02:38:42.560 i mean behind his back she don't want to
02:38:44.479 give up the small teddy bear
02:38:46.240 for the bigger teddy bear that jesus has
02:38:48.319 waiting for her
02:38:49.439 there is prosperity for all families
02:38:52.960 here on earth right now in service
02:38:56.399 to god there's happiness there's joy
02:38:59.760 it's not a possibility it's a
02:39:01.359 probability just the fact that god
02:39:04.080 woke me up got me here safely and
02:39:06.479 allowed me to talk to you
02:39:08.319 right now and spark the minds
02:39:11.600 of the people that are anointed to
02:39:13.520 change the world
02:39:14.880 is already what god wanted me to do if i
02:39:17.600 didn't take a breath
02:39:18.800 after this point god had me here for
02:39:21.200 this conversation
02:39:22.479 right now but i think god has more for
02:39:24.720 me playing i don't think they gonna come
02:39:26.319 for me until he done
02:39:27.600 until he done with me they ain't gonna
02:39:29.359 come for me until they done with me
02:39:30.880 i want to make it so if someone wanted
02:39:32.080 to sample and put in a beat it'd be like
02:39:33.600 perfect
02:39:33.960 [Laughter]
02:39:38.000 they ain't gonna come they ain't gonna
02:39:39.280 come for me until they done with me they
02:39:41.359 ain't gonna come for me until he done
02:39:42.800 with me
02:39:45.280 uh yeah yeah yeah help yourself you're
02:39:48.160 always creating
02:39:49.359 now yeah but do you understand what i'm
02:39:51.760 saying
02:39:53.040 okay tell me what i'm saying what you're
02:39:54.960 saying is that
02:39:56.960 it's it's your overall philosophy
02:40:00.720 the way you're approaching life you're
02:40:03.280 approaching life that there
02:40:04.640 is good for everyone if we
02:40:07.760 if we all work together if we all work
02:40:09.680 together in the spirit of the way you
02:40:11.600 think
02:40:12.560 the spirit of god that will
02:40:15.600 not not approach this like with a famine
02:40:18.399 mentality
02:40:19.520 but approach this like there's enough
02:40:21.200 for everybody there's an abundance if we
02:40:22.960 if we engineer it correctly
02:40:24.720 if we think about it correctly if we all
02:40:26.720 come together with the spirit of
02:40:28.160 everybody helping everybody this is the
02:40:30.479 spirit of christianity this is
02:40:32.479 the good spirit of christianity not the
02:40:34.399 christianity that gets despised or
02:40:36.720 disparaged or you know evangelists
02:40:39.279 driving around in private jets
02:40:40.960 the the spirit of of goodness and
02:40:43.680 treating each other like brothers and
02:40:44.880 sisters
02:40:45.680 yes but this can be done on a national
02:40:47.600 scale yes
02:40:48.800 because those evangelists or the people
02:40:51.040 who who spread the word of god
02:40:53.120 you know there's people who are praying
02:40:54.720 for me you know we're praying like i
02:40:56.479 said
02:40:57.040 i like to okay yes i
02:41:00.080 am a genius but one of my most genius
02:41:03.439 skill sets is recognizing other geniuses
02:41:06.640 and empowering them and giving them the
02:41:08.800 platform so the people that have been
02:41:10.479 praying for me this whole time
02:41:12.800 you know for jay to work for the kingdom
02:41:15.439 look at me
02:41:16.000 look at me right here working from the
02:41:18.000 kingdom that not leaning on my ego
02:41:20.479 not leaning on anything but leaning on
02:41:22.319 god in this situation saying
02:41:24.319 let's you know let's rise up together
02:41:26.399 and show people what it's like
02:41:28.160 to be christ like yeah we fall short you
02:41:31.040 know i mean
02:41:31.760 people love to like look at the
02:41:33.040 christians that are the least
02:41:35.040 christ-like to judge christianity
02:41:37.200 as a whole well a lot of people got
02:41:38.960 jordans in 23 years old and
02:41:40.720 don't very few of them play like lebron
02:41:43.200 you know they want to be like
02:41:45.040 like mike but there's very few people
02:41:47.520 that get that close
02:41:48.800 you know it's like yeah yeah what you're
02:41:51.279 saying is beautiful
02:41:52.160 yeah that they do judge the people that
02:41:54.399 fail
02:41:55.359 people always go to the furthest extent
02:41:58.560 like if you talk about uh abortion
02:42:01.920 culture
02:42:02.560 people immediately go to rape but don't
02:42:05.040 do
02:42:05.600 the math on what percentage that is and
02:42:08.399 for me as a
02:42:09.359 as a christian president
02:42:12.880 you know as i said i go on that i
02:42:15.200 touched on him before
02:42:16.319 i realize we're in an imperfect world
02:42:18.880 you know when i
02:42:19.840 talk to uh my fellow christians and we
02:42:22.800 talk about meat
02:42:24.000 we talk about guns we talk about in this
02:42:26.640 imperfect world
02:42:27.760 there's a transition between where we
02:42:30.160 are today
02:42:31.359 and where we're going does yeah does the
02:42:33.680 meat industry have a
02:42:35.279 great impact on uh
02:42:38.479 the ozone i from what i hear it does
02:42:42.560 and we have to transition one of the
02:42:45.040 things i wanted
02:42:46.560 it's a thought that came in and thank
02:42:47.760 you for allowing me to give you the
02:42:49.439 thoughts that are
02:42:50.479 coming into my head as opposed to trying
02:42:52.479 to put me on a grid because i'm off the
02:42:54.319 grid
02:42:54.720 period the way i think clearly i paint
02:42:57.120 in circles
02:42:58.160 you know i don't i don't paint inside of
02:43:00.880 the lines right
02:43:01.920 so i was thinking about i forget the
02:43:03.760 lady's name starts with a t
02:43:05.279 but she changed the meat industry
02:43:07.279 because she was hsp like highly
02:43:09.040 sensitive person that's uh
02:43:10.720 and put the uh the cows in a in round
02:43:13.680 bins
02:43:14.880 and uh that's what i'm doing when i say
02:43:18.399 spatial engineering that's what i'm
02:43:19.680 doing
02:43:20.399 with our spaces that i'm designing with
02:43:22.720 the farms
02:43:23.920 and uh with the school systems
02:43:27.520 the unlearned systems the what are the
02:43:29.760 things that you're going to need
02:43:31.520 you know in the future because 30 years
02:43:33.840 we don't we don't even know we think
02:43:35.359 probably the things that we're learning
02:43:37.040 in school right now won't even apply
02:43:38.960 to people when they're 30 years old that
02:43:41.120 are learning this stuff
02:43:42.479 you know age especially with technology
02:43:44.560 especially with technology and the
02:43:46.000 people who design the curriculums
02:43:52.000 way before technology yeah so
02:43:55.200 i mean i was in computer programming
02:43:57.120 when i was uh
02:43:58.240 uh eight years old and i used to
02:44:01.680 know how to program this how i got into
02:44:03.279 music in seventh grade i had a
02:44:04.800 amiga computer that had 4096 colors
02:44:07.359 that's why i got that one
02:44:08.640 uh and i would program the different
02:44:10.560 sprites and
02:44:11.920 uh draw out each of the characters and
02:44:13.680 animate them and i thought that was the
02:44:14.960 next frontier to like and because i
02:44:16.319 would do like animation books i wanted
02:44:17.680 to be a
02:44:18.560 animator and then i started doing the
02:44:21.680 the music they had a music program on do
02:44:23.520 the music for the video games
02:44:25.040 and then i found myself running home
02:44:26.640 from school all the way from 95th street
02:44:28.319 to 119th street
02:44:29.760 to go and just keep programming the
02:44:31.920 music so this is like third
02:44:33.840 age you know 12 13
02:44:36.880 you know programming video games and
02:44:38.640 that being the gateway into
02:44:40.640 programming music i got a longer story
02:44:43.279 about that but i know you want to ask me
02:44:44.560 some more serious stuff so um
02:44:47.279 ding okay this is a big one
02:44:51.840 the military um if you
02:44:54.960 really did become president when excuse
02:44:57.120 me when you do become president
02:44:59.520 you're going to have to deal with
02:45:01.120 hostile governments
02:45:02.800 you're going to have to deal with
02:45:04.160 hostile militaries
02:45:06.160 and dictators you know people
02:45:09.279 in another country that in other
02:45:11.359 countries that don't have a value of
02:45:13.359 human life
02:45:14.080 and throughout history we've had
02:45:17.279 immense problems because of that because
02:45:19.439 of military conflicts
02:45:21.040 how do you think you will approach that
02:45:25.279 i mean you will be the
02:45:26.000 commander-in-chief of the greatest army
02:45:27.439 the world has ever known
02:45:28.800 if you're in that position and we have
02:45:30.720 to deal with some sort of a
02:45:32.560 military action with china what if china
02:45:34.319 takes over taiwan
02:45:36.080 what if they invade taiwan
02:45:39.200 what if something happens with syria
02:45:41.760 what if something happens with
02:45:43.200 iran what if something happens with
02:45:45.359 russia
02:45:46.319 and you have to make decisions about
02:45:49.359 military action
02:45:52.080 have you thought about this
02:45:56.080 yes i would
02:46:04.960 i have to say again like covet i'm a
02:46:08.080 civilian
02:46:09.520 and people could have all their
02:46:10.720 perspectives that they could have of
02:46:12.640 what they would do
02:46:14.080 in that situation but i would have the
02:46:16.800 greatest professionals
02:46:18.080 on the planet the most skilled people
02:46:21.040 that have all the
02:46:22.240 experience that would present the
02:46:24.000 information and i would make
02:46:26.080 the most sound rational decisions
02:46:29.439 and i would follow god's
02:46:33.520 will in my approach
02:46:41.120 to
02:46:44.720 to dealing with these other countries to
02:46:46.479 dealing with these other leaders
02:46:48.319 there's there's something about you know
02:46:52.800 our president's personality and
02:46:56.880 the the leader of north korea's
02:46:58.399 personality where there's
02:47:01.840 there's a level of common respect and
02:47:05.439 and that's the reason why they were able
02:47:07.040 to talk and
02:47:08.479 we we the fear had been taken
02:47:11.520 off of us like people who are
02:47:16.240 uh god-fearing
02:47:20.319 self-made uh servants
02:47:24.479 of their people
02:47:29.520 these these other you know scary
02:47:33.680 dictators they feel like they're that
02:47:36.880 for their country and if they see
02:47:44.800 a president that they know is just
02:47:47.200 taking a check or part of a bigger
02:47:49.359 conglomerate now i don't want it like i
02:47:50.880 said i want to denounce
02:47:52.479 any of the uh uh candidates
02:47:57.840 then
02:48:01.520 it's it's very it's very transactional
02:48:06.240 it's um
02:48:14.840 and
02:48:23.840 i just said a prayer in this situation
02:48:26.560 this isn't
02:48:27.439 you said a prayer because of what what
02:48:30.240 what what
02:48:31.359 motivated you to say a prayer right
02:48:32.720 there
02:48:35.520 the seriousness the significance of this
02:48:37.520 subject yeah absolutely
02:48:39.120 we can we can't jump from jokes about
02:48:42.240 this to
02:48:42.800 you know joking about people's lives
02:48:44.640 right we have to
02:48:46.160 completely be still in this moment
02:48:51.600 allow god to guide our steps
02:48:54.720 and ask the right questions
02:48:59.359 with the highest ranking officials
02:49:01.520 possible
02:49:04.080 this isn't something that you just wing
02:49:06.880 or that you just come in
02:49:08.479 and say i did a bit of research i got
02:49:11.279 this like
02:49:12.160 political answer right that's gonna get
02:49:14.720 a rise out of people like this is this
02:49:16.240 is people's lives
02:49:17.439 this is you know this is a whole
02:49:20.800 different you know setting or or mood
02:49:24.240 than what this whole
02:49:25.200 uh interview has has been about
02:49:28.399 this is you know people are suffering
02:49:32.720 in the throughout all sides in
02:49:36.319 in in israel and in nigeria and haiti
02:49:40.399 we're we're suffering the police force
02:49:42.560 in in
02:49:43.760 in in chicago and the the people the
02:49:46.240 people who have been
02:49:47.120 harmed by police and the police like
02:49:51.040 this all is going to take
02:49:54.399 serious time like time is love it's
02:49:56.560 going to take that love and that time
02:49:58.160 and
02:50:00.319 moments of listening moments of
02:50:02.160 understanding moments like when my wife
02:50:03.920 goes and visits
02:50:05.279 people in prison and she hears their
02:50:08.080 stories
02:50:08.880 she says i understand i understand
02:50:12.479 why you're into in
02:50:16.080 why you're in that situation i would
02:50:17.439 have did the same thing in this
02:50:18.479 situation
02:50:20.160 and for us to go to foreign countries
02:50:22.160 and really
02:50:23.840 understand why that they're you know
02:50:26.720 that they're in these situations
02:50:29.040 or why the killing has gone for so long
02:50:32.080 or why the hate
02:50:33.200 has gone so long and why the pain just
02:50:35.439 keeps on
02:50:37.200 you know compounding and compacting
02:50:43.279 there's the empathy that i just have as
02:50:46.080 an artist
02:50:47.439 that it doesn't become a two plus two
02:50:50.560 equals four situation my dad was
02:50:53.680 actually
02:50:54.160 a a a psychology major
02:50:57.760 and a christian uh therapist
02:51:01.200 and this therapy we talk about therapy
02:51:05.520 period it's like
02:51:09.040 we need healing internationally not just
02:51:12.319 selfishly for america america is number
02:51:14.399 one
02:51:15.240 internationally we need healing
02:51:19.120 and
02:51:23.520 i would lead i would
02:51:27.359 i would lead with with love
02:51:34.080 dignity the responsibility to our
02:51:38.000 country
02:51:39.200 the coverage of our families of our
02:51:44.840 soldiers
02:51:49.200 and in full service to god and to the
02:51:50.800 american people
02:51:57.920 it's the there's a mode
02:52:01.920 that i would be in in that position like
02:52:05.520 when i was a producer and i was a really
02:52:08.479 young man
02:52:10.720 i was running around
02:52:13.840 hopping on trains or
02:52:17.840 you know hopping turn styles and stuff
02:52:19.520 and like stealing from
02:52:21.439 cars and i mean not stealing cars but
02:52:23.439 stealing clothes from stores and
02:52:25.600 um then i was
02:52:30.399 selling music and uh you know going and
02:52:34.080 buying
02:52:34.880 leather jackets and stuff then you know
02:52:36.720 dating a whole bunch of girls going on
02:52:38.319 tour
02:52:39.279 and then i had a family and
02:52:43.200 i had to adjust a lot of my mentality
02:52:46.560 and behavior to grow and be the man
02:52:50.479 that i needed to be then god called me
02:52:53.920 and i gave my life to christ
02:52:57.520 and god is helping me to be the
02:52:59.520 christian that i need to be
02:53:01.920 and when it's in god's will that i
02:53:04.560 become the leader
02:53:06.080 i will become the leader that i need to
02:53:08.080 be
02:53:09.439 so right now as i said i'm a civilian
02:53:12.399 but
02:53:13.680 my heart my mind and my spirit
02:53:17.359 is in a place where i feel i know that
02:53:20.720 i'm being
02:53:21.200 i'm being called to captain this ship
02:53:24.399 like when roosevelt went in america was
02:53:27.760 in shambles
02:53:29.040 when i when i'd say those things about
02:53:30.479 those numbers when i went to adidas when
02:53:32.720 i went to
02:53:33.200 gap like i'm the person
02:53:37.040 that you actually call when things are
02:53:39.680 not going so well
02:53:41.279 you know you have that the mob movies is
02:53:42.960 the guy that goes cleans up everything
02:53:44.560 and like puts everything
02:53:46.399 i'm i'm like the forensic where in the
02:53:49.520 same way how
02:53:50.800 you saw my mind touch on ten things at a
02:53:53.760 time
02:53:54.479 and then i had to say ten sentences at a
02:53:56.319 time if i could say them or maybe narrow
02:53:57.760 them down to seven
02:54:00.640 that's the way my mind takes you know
02:54:03.040 information
02:54:03.840 in and then it synthesizes it and it
02:54:05.840 comes out as a song or comes out as a
02:54:07.359 product
02:54:08.880 using that mentality as a leader
02:54:12.880 fearless god-fearing we
02:54:16.160 will heal we will show the world what
02:54:19.279 america should be
02:54:22.399 the dream you said all this [ __ ] all the
02:54:25.600 things that you've said
02:54:26.560 in the most non-politician way i've ever
02:54:29.200 heard anybody describe these things
02:54:30.880 i know you really mean these things this
02:54:32.720 is this is it's
02:54:34.000 resonating with me that you're being a
02:54:36.000 hundred percent honest
02:54:37.520 and natural and that's that's
02:54:40.720 what we're missing in politics today i
02:54:44.000 mean it's one of the things that made
02:54:45.600 people excited about trump
02:54:47.040 as at least he was an alternative to the
02:54:49.120 political talk
02:54:50.399 he was an alternative to politicians
02:54:52.560 speak where you know they're being
02:54:53.760 dishonest and disingenuous
02:54:55.359 but you just accept it you know they're
02:54:57.200 reading things that have been written by
02:54:59.040 speech writers but you just accept it
02:55:01.120 because it says
02:55:02.479 the things that you want to hear checks
02:55:04.479 the boxes that'll say okay you got my
02:55:06.800 vote
02:55:07.760 what you're saying though is what you
02:55:09.120 really feel and you really think and
02:55:10.720 you're not saying it like a politician
02:55:12.560 and that's what's going to resonate and
02:55:13.760 people going to be mad at me if you get
02:55:15.920 pregnant you become president
02:55:17.520 you made kanye west seem likeable
02:55:20.640 you turned him into the [ __ ]
02:55:22.479 president you
02:55:23.760 made him seem like a rational choice for
02:55:25.600 president this conversation
02:55:27.359 exposes a side of you that i don't think
02:55:29.600 anybody's ever seen before
02:55:30.880 and a long-form conversation where you
02:55:33.760 realize that you you are a visionary you
02:55:35.920 do you do have
02:55:37.120 these ideas are real you're not posing
02:55:39.439 it's not [ __ ]
02:55:40.560 this is who you are and your well
02:55:43.120 thought out response
