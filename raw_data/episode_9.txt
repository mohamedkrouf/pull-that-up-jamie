00:00:00.000 logan experience joy my day Joe Rogan
00:00:03.240 podcast by night and we're live
00:00:06.120 gentlemen here we go again what's
00:00:08.820 happening back in the room a pleasure to
00:00:11.070 see you guys as always this is one of my
00:00:13.139 favorite podcasts that we ever do and
00:00:16.100 this is very timely because first of all
00:00:19.770 the big New York Times article about the
00:00:22.369 possibility of a comet hitting Los
00:00:24.779 Angeles the preparations for what they
00:00:27.269 would do if a comet hit Los Angeles and
00:00:29.750 the comet known as Donald Trump that's
00:00:32.759 hit the United States and he's even got
00:00:36.719 the hair it's just the whole things I
00:00:38.940 mean if the end of the world was coming
00:00:40.739 boy it's all on the wall you know the
00:00:43.140 writings all there it's kind of crazy
00:00:44.550 mm-hmm so what's the latest and the
00:00:46.680 greatest well the latest and the latest
00:00:49.110 and the greatest is like I mean last
00:00:50.399 year when we sat down with you I think
00:00:51.960 it was last November mmm yeah it was
00:00:54.660 almost a year got floated in the
00:00:56.100 discussion the idea that this really
00:00:57.690 important comet research that's going on
00:00:59.940 which is just changing our whole view of
00:01:02.000 history and prehistory and of the future
00:01:04.619 of humanity but it would be good to make
00:01:06.840 a film about this and crowdfunded I
00:01:08.760 actually mentioned that to the
00:01:09.780 scientists and they said what we really
00:01:11.430 need is more funding for our research
00:01:13.680 and so they've inspired by basically by
00:01:16.979 your show they have put out a
00:01:18.600 crowdfunding campaign which is linked on
00:01:22.680 my on my website it's the comet research
00:01:25.140 group and it's it's a big story right
00:01:28.020 now so how can people find it really
00:01:30.299 quickly it's IndieGoGo well now that
00:01:32.579 research much quick away just go just go
00:01:35.040 to my website Oh Graham Hancock calm and
00:01:37.650 there's a revolving banner which is the
00:01:39.390 comet research group click on that and
00:01:41.280 you're in this beautiful ok Graham
00:01:42.960 Hancock calm and then crowd funding for
00:01:46.560 comet research and so what are they were
00:01:49.020 trying to put together well they're
00:01:51.060 they're wanting to see the thing is
00:01:53.220 these guys have actually not had any
00:01:54.869 official funding this is a group of
00:01:56.549 major highly credentialed scientists who
00:01:58.590 for the last decade have been
00:02:00.170 investigating the extraordinary story of
00:02:03.360 a massive comet series of comet impacts
00:02:05.759 on the North American ice cap twelve
00:02:07.409 thousand eight hundred years ago that is
00:02:09.780 the the global Cataclysm that wipes out
00:02:12.480 a whole civilization
00:02:13.780 from from prehistory so that's why it's
00:02:15.820 of interest to me they're not coming at
00:02:19.300 it from that point of view they're
00:02:20.620 coming at it from rediscovering
00:02:22.360 something that we've lost about
00:02:23.650 ourselves something is really important
00:02:25.390 to understand the role of cataclysms in
00:02:27.760 the story of the earth and they need to
00:02:30.070 do much more research they need to go
00:02:31.660 back to Greenland and look for the nano
00:02:34.480 diamonds in the in the Greenland ice
00:02:36.459 cores they need there's a there's an
00:02:38.260 ancient city which they're not revealing
00:02:40.150 the name of which they're pretty certain
00:02:41.770 was wiped out by a comet impact about
00:02:43.780 four and a half thousand years ago they
00:02:45.340 want to go there and investigate that so
00:02:47.590 there's a lot of fieldwork they need to
00:02:48.970 do to drive home this hypothesis and to
00:02:52.200 frankly put down the opposition because
00:02:54.580 there's been so much opposition to this
00:02:56.440 idea from people with vested interest in
00:02:58.450 other theories that that's why these
00:03:00.610 guys have not got funding so the only
00:03:02.020 place they're going to get funding to do
00:03:03.880 this further research is from members of
00:03:05.980 the general public and that's what we're
00:03:07.300 hoping that will will happen it's called
00:03:09.940 the comet research group there's a
00:03:11.770 banner on my site and all the links are
00:03:13.540 there to their crowdfunding to their
00:03:15.010 website which is full of masses of
00:03:16.570 scientific information and to their
00:03:18.760 Facebook page as well it is a very
00:03:22.030 unusual thing the the fact that we know
00:03:25.390 that comets and all sorts of various
00:03:27.610 large objects have impacted the earth we
00:03:30.190 see the craters we know they exist but
00:03:32.650 it's so rarely discussed it's so it's so
00:03:35.170 strange if it wasn't for this article in
00:03:37.209 the New York Times I can't remember one
00:03:38.500 the last time and that it even came up
00:03:40.150 and it's such a huge issue
00:03:42.100 it's a massive issue it's a massive
00:03:43.630 issue both Randall and I have really you
00:03:45.310 know given a great deal of thought to
00:03:46.600 there's nothing rattled you that the
00:03:48.340 point is that catastrophes are the
00:03:50.530 untold story of our past we were given a
00:03:54.670 little we're givers a little hint of it
00:03:57.120 February of 2013
00:03:59.170 Chelyabinsk siberia reverie of it yeah
00:04:02.320 yeah now that was just a little cosmic
00:04:04.600 spec came in I was about fifty feet in
00:04:07.090 diameter which is about um and it came
00:04:10.690 in at a fairly low angle it blew up
00:04:12.459 nearly eighteen get that thing right in
00:04:14.470 front you right in front of me like this
00:04:16.089 yeah if you flat it out it's usually
00:04:17.680 easier how's this just better yeah all
00:04:20.200 right there we go so it came in I think
00:04:22.450 it exploded twelve miles about 20
00:04:25.510 kilometers up in the atmosphere but it
00:04:27.190 still enough to damage thousands of
00:04:29.080 buildings and injure 1500 people another
00:04:32.110 thing about that one is if it had been
00:04:33.730 slightly larger if it had come in at a
00:04:36.130 slightly steeper angle a little bit
00:04:38.170 higher velocity you could have had
00:04:40.390 thousands of fatalities rather than just
00:04:42.430 injuries and that would have been major
00:04:44.380 headline news at that point as it was
00:04:47.170 it's already forgotten but you do
00:04:49.840 remember yes oh yeah oversee we may even
00:04:52.540 talk I've talked I believe indeed we did
00:04:54.310 I think most videos of it you know it's
00:04:56.710 fascinating is Russia has so many of
00:04:59.050 those trail cam and nut trail cam um
00:05:01.090 dash cam photo cameras that's right
00:05:03.880 because they have so much insurance
00:05:05.320 fraud apparently over there slam into
00:05:07.480 each other all the time and they want to
00:05:08.590 record it so we're fortunate enough to
00:05:10.960 have so many of those videos because of
00:05:13.300 that which puts it on the record whereas
00:05:15.340 other otherwise it would it would not be
00:05:17.350 I think I think people don't they don't
00:05:19.300 like to talk about cataclysms and
00:05:21.130 catastrophes and actually nor do I
00:05:23.110 nobody wants a horrible Cataclysm to
00:05:25.120 occur but this is the point which is
00:05:27.490 that the prospect of a comet or asteroid
00:05:30.300 Cataclysm on the earth is actually much
00:05:32.800 higher than has been told to us up till
00:05:36.190 now and something can be done about it
00:05:38.590 it doesn't have to be the end of the
00:05:40.300 world we don't have to you know say okay
00:05:42.100 it's all over forget about it quite the
00:05:43.600 contrary this is this is just something
00:05:45.490 that would be prudent and rational for
00:05:47.950 the human species to do and amongst many
00:05:50.470 other imprudent and irrational things
00:05:52.900 that we focus on instead we should be
00:05:55.330 focusing on a bit on this well at least
00:05:57.610 just to heighten awareness of it and and
00:05:59.890 also the possibility that we've been
00:06:02.140 nailed a bunch of times and we've
00:06:04.060 forgotten about it and this is this is
00:06:05.950 the big thing that you've been dealing
00:06:07.060 with your entire career this skepticism
00:06:09.010 about past civilizations I mean I got
00:06:12.280 into it with Michael Shermer who's a
00:06:13.960 friend of mine who's a very famous
00:06:15.400 skeptic I got into him with it yesterday
00:06:18.930 because I posted that you were going to
00:06:21.430 be on and he started chirping something
00:06:24.220 about civilizations 12,000 years ago
00:06:26.470 where's the evidence on like to do you
00:06:28.240 don't even you're saying this and you
00:06:30.040 don't even know about gobekli tepe so I
00:06:32.080 sent him gobekli tepe and literally like
00:06:33.700 five hours later he wrote something
00:06:36.340 claiming that while that was made by
00:06:38.380 hunter-gatherers it was all just really
00:06:40.090 to sort of suit he
00:06:41.080 narrative so he doesn't know that no one
00:06:43.180 knows nobody knows that they're so
00:06:44.919 determined to keep the existing model
00:06:47.169 and and when new evidence comes in which
00:06:49.060 can't be explained by the existing model
00:06:51.009 they just try to explain away the new
00:06:53.409 evidence and not not think maybe it's
00:06:55.330 time to change our theory you know this
00:06:57.639 is this is the unfortunate thing but
00:06:59.710 cataclysms a global Cataclysm the
00:07:01.810 massive event that happened twelve
00:07:03.460 thousand eight hundred years ago the
00:07:04.810 Younger Dryas impacts which were a
00:07:06.909 series of comet impacts on the north
00:07:08.439 american ice cap this accounts for why
00:07:10.719 we don't have a lot of evidence hard
00:07:14.169 evidence over 12,000 plus year old
00:07:16.090 civilization because it went down in
00:07:18.009 that catastrophe it was wiped out I've
00:07:20.379 been trying to amass the evidence
00:07:21.819 actually that complements what Graham is
00:07:24.069 doing and it really answers that
00:07:25.750 question the Schirmer brought up and
00:07:27.370 it's a legitimate question where where's
00:07:29.169 the evidence but I'm quite sure the
00:07:31.569 Schirmer is not really educated in the
00:07:34.599 extreme events that have really taken
00:07:36.759 place on this planet in the last ten to
00:07:39.400 twenty thousand years um and what that
00:07:41.919 would do to any kind of evidence it
00:07:43.719 maybe while we have some time here today
00:07:45.310 I've brought a few things to try to
00:07:46.659 convey some sense of how extreme some of
00:07:51.069 these changes have been and how one
00:07:53.710 would actually be quite shocked to find
00:07:55.419 anything existing in the aftermath of
00:07:58.599 these events well Michael Shermer is a
00:08:00.159 brilliant guy and I don't mean the [ __ ]
00:08:01.870 on him but but what what is disturbing
00:08:04.180 to me is that his knee-jerk reaction to
00:08:06.520 this without having any research at all
00:08:08.379 in the subject not knowing at all about
00:08:10.539 gobekli tepe which was discovered in
00:08:12.219 what the 90s
00:08:13.029 yeah 96 I mean so this is to me this is
00:08:16.449 something that I've looked at because of
00:08:17.800 you guys in great depth when I read your
00:08:20.289 book I was just completely enthralled
00:08:22.120 with this idea of history having some
00:08:24.490 sort of or rise and fall and
00:08:27.069 civilization having these resets so I've
00:08:28.539 been absorbed in it for a long time but
00:08:30.460 what's fascinating to me is people that
00:08:32.169 consider themselves to be skeptical or
00:08:34.299 you know or I mean he's a skeptic
00:08:37.240 professional insurer but many people who
00:08:39.640 question anything that's outside of what
00:08:41.948 they've been told as soon as they hear
00:08:43.839 any sort of a theory outside of what
00:08:45.190 they were told they immediately call
00:08:46.570 quackery happy anything and this but
00:08:48.880 it's it's a weird knee-jerk reaction to
00:08:50.860 something especially when you talk about
00:08:52.720 asteroids that is
00:08:54.290 very real part of our past we have a ton
00:08:56.899 of evidence I mean there's actual
00:08:58.820 craters that you can look at on earth
00:09:00.860 the moon which has no atmosphere is
00:09:03.259 littered with them and if we look at the
00:09:05.329 moon as a model for what could possibly
00:09:07.670 have happened to earth or at least you
00:09:09.649 know some of them obviously with the
00:09:11.990 moon having no atmosphere it's going to
00:09:13.430 get hit a lot more than we are sure but
00:09:15.440 still I mean this is a very real
00:09:17.569 situation that this this solar system
00:09:21.170 you know at least as far as we know the
00:09:23.540 only solar system has to deal with this
00:09:25.100 but we know this is a real issue maybe
00:09:28.279 we've seen impacts what it's like you
00:09:29.870 just said on the one hand you have earth
00:09:31.610 scientists looking at the earth and what
00:09:33.620 they're realizing is that the earth is
00:09:35.240 pockmarked with scars and each of these
00:09:37.399 scars represents a tremendously powerful
00:09:39.610 catastrophe that's happened in the
00:09:41.389 history of the earth
00:09:42.230 now that's accepted by mainstream
00:09:43.699 science that that major catastrophes
00:09:46.430 have happened in the history of the
00:09:47.720 earth but where this thing now is about
00:09:49.639 to come full circle is the recognition
00:09:51.620 that these kinds of catastrophes have
00:09:53.149 also influenced the rise and fall of
00:09:54.920 civilization and a lot more a lot more
00:09:59.240 extremely than then has been recognized
00:10:01.459 up to this point and while geologists
00:10:03.800 and earth scientists are looking at the
00:10:05.120 surface of the earth and realizing that
00:10:07.029 itched into the surface of the earth or
00:10:09.529 imprinted into the surface of the earth
00:10:11.029 are hundreds of scars of which
00:10:12.800 undoubtedly are only a small percentage
00:10:15.260 of the total that exist at the same time
00:10:18.560 astronomers are looking out into
00:10:19.910 near-earth space and discovering that we
00:10:22.690 cohabit space with a lot of stuff it's
00:10:25.160 not as empty as we thought just within
00:10:26.630 the last six or seven weeks we've had
00:10:28.040 two close flybys of previously
00:10:30.589 undiscovered that really of previously
00:10:32.510 undiscovered asteroids this the point is
00:10:34.250 NASA keeps saying well is you know
00:10:35.750 there's we've counted 1,650 asteroids
00:10:38.689 and none of them are going to hit the
00:10:39.800 earth in the next hundred years well
00:10:41.240 yeah that's true but what about all the
00:10:42.949 ones they haven't counted which are
00:10:44.630 estimated to run into hundreds of
00:10:46.220 thousands and which haven't been seen
00:10:47.720 yet and what happens is we see them
00:10:49.399 roughly ten days before they pass the
00:10:52.040 earth that is not enough time to do
00:10:54.649 anything about them but we have time if
00:10:56.569 we're prepared to be rational and
00:10:57.980 reasonable as a civilization to take
00:10:59.540 care of this issue now when you're
00:11:01.009 dealing with hundreds of thousands of
00:11:02.449 near-earth objects that are flying
00:11:03.860 around like what what are the things
00:11:06.079 that could be done
00:11:07.580 to protect Earth you can paint it's it's
00:11:12.170 low-tech actually you can paint one side
00:11:13.820 of the asteroid affect its albedo so
00:11:16.010 that the sun's rays push differentially
00:11:17.960 on one side rather than the other that
00:11:19.640 will shift its orbit slightly it has to
00:11:21.710 be calculated you can give it a little
00:11:23.030 knock with with with a rocket basically
00:11:26.690 you don't want to blow it up
00:11:27.800 you don't want to turn you know you're
00:11:29.900 one big piece of our artillery shell
00:11:31.700 into buckshot you don't want to do that
00:11:33.350 you want to you want to move it into a
00:11:35.300 safer orbit you can mount jets on it
00:11:37.490 people are looking now to mining
00:11:39.050 asteroids of course our society always
00:11:41.090 goes our civilization always goes for
00:11:42.980 the where weather where the money's to
00:11:45.260 be made but yeah if we can mine
00:11:46.970 asteroids we can move asteroids and and
00:11:49.490 the technology is there and ironically
00:11:51.530 the most dangerous asteroids are going
00:11:53.570 to be the ones that are the closest to
00:11:55.370 the earth which are the most accessible
00:11:57.710 and the asteroids pretty much have
00:12:00.790 unbelievable amounts of resources on
00:12:03.650 them I mean pretty much everything that
00:12:04.850 is being mined on the earth can be found
00:12:07.280 in asteroids from the hydrocarbons to
00:12:09.200 precious metals to all of these things
00:12:11.450 and we're not that far away from
00:12:14.230 technologically being able to actually
00:12:16.760 you know mount expeditions to asteroids
00:12:19.580 and mined them and that's that's the the
00:12:22.160 you know that's the solution I kind of
00:12:24.410 prefer because again these things are
00:12:26.840 tremendous sources of reefs of all kinds
00:12:30.140 of things that would be usable to an
00:12:31.760 expanding civilization and we could
00:12:35.510 feasibly within a decade or two be
00:12:38.570 mining asteroids and again the ones that
00:12:41.510 are the easiest to access are also going
00:12:43.280 to be the ones that are more dangerous
00:12:44.630 because they're the ones that are coming
00:12:46.130 the closest to the earth so and another
00:12:50.090 point here is that there is one specific
00:12:53.050 danger there's one specific if you like
00:12:55.700 region of the sky that really needs to
00:12:57.470 be looked at and this is this is the
00:12:59.090 region of the sky this is why I wrote
00:13:01.100 magicians of the gods because because of
00:13:03.320 this discovery that there's a thing
00:13:04.700 called the torrid meteor stream which is
00:13:07.190 30 million kilometres wide and which
00:13:09.620 envelops the solar system and the earth
00:13:11.870 on its orbit around the Sun passes
00:13:14.210 through the torrid meteor stream twice a
00:13:16.520 year turns out the torrid meteor stream
00:13:19.370 is the debris
00:13:21.260 of a giant comet that came in to the
00:13:24.110 inner solar system about 20,000 years
00:13:26.840 ago that thing was at least a hundred
00:13:29.090 kilometers in diameter according to
00:13:30.980 their calculations it may have been more
00:13:32.840 so and then like other comets like
00:13:34.400 shoemaker-levy 9 which spectacularly hit
00:13:36.560 Jupiter in 1994 it began to break up
00:13:39.470 into multiple fragments and those carry
00:13:41.780 on orbiting on the original path which
00:13:43.880 and as they break up more and more they
00:13:45.710 degrade and small bits and large bits
00:13:47.990 break off and it gradually fills up a
00:13:49.670 kind of huge hoop of debris that the
00:13:52.580 earth is passing through twice a year it
00:13:54.650 takes us 12 days to pass through it we
00:13:56.810 do two and a half million kilometres a
00:13:58.250 day on our orbital path 12 days to get
00:14:00.740 through the torrid meteor stream and the
00:14:03.050 scientists of the comet research group
00:14:05.030 have made the point that a big object
00:14:07.850 out of the torrid meteor stream multiple
00:14:10.490 objects as a matter of fact was what hit
00:14:12.410 the North American ice cap twelve
00:14:13.880 thousand eight hundred years ago it
00:14:15.470 looks like there was a second series of
00:14:16.970 impacts eleven thousand six hundred
00:14:18.590 years ago from the same source it looks
00:14:21.260 like there were other impacts in the
00:14:23.030 Bronze Age the most recent almost
00:14:25.460 definite impact out of the torrid meteor
00:14:27.410 stream was Tunguska in Siberia back in
00:14:30.860 1908 that hit on the 30th of June 1908
00:14:34.160 and that's at the peak of the torrid
00:14:36.110 June shower when we passed through the
00:14:38.090 tories in June and and in November and
00:14:40.760 what they're saying is we really need to
00:14:42.830 focus on this torrid meteor stream their
00:14:44.840 calculations are that there are hundreds
00:14:46.760 and hundreds of massive objects in that
00:14:49.250 torrid meteor stream and you know as a
00:14:51.230 comet breaks up into bits
00:14:52.940 it becomes those bits become asteroids
00:14:54.920 and those asteroids are circling in the
00:14:56.690 torrid media stream and I've likened it
00:14:58.970 to strapping on a a blindfold and
00:15:01.670 crossing an eight-lane interstate twice
00:15:04.070 a year and just hoping that we don't hit
00:15:06.680 any heavy traffic you know that we meet
00:15:08.630 bicycles or motorcycles rather than
00:15:10.970 rather than trucks but the trucks are
00:15:12.860 out there and what the comet research
00:15:14.870 group scientists are saying is we need
00:15:16.250 now to be in depth investigating the
00:15:19.520 torrid meteor stream because it appears
00:15:21.170 to be the hidden hand in human
00:15:22.730 civilization it has wiped out episodes
00:15:25.730 of our history in the past and there's
00:15:27.260 no reason to expect that it won't do so
00:15:29.270 again unless we do something about it
00:15:31.970 because the remnants of that original
00:15:34.130 giant comet
00:15:34.910 still circling in the torrid media
00:15:36.650 stream and they are [ __ ] dangerous
00:15:38.270 now how is this being received in
00:15:40.490 mainstream science I mean is there any
00:15:42.470 resistance to this because it seems like
00:15:44.030 this is all pretty straightforward and
00:15:45.680 entrer scible mostly being ignored
00:15:48.080 mostly being ignored why I think that is
00:15:50.750 by scientists who have a vested interest
00:15:52.670 in other ideas first of all there's a
00:15:56.120 vested interest in not admitting that
00:15:58.100 cataclysms are important at all this
00:16:00.290 goes right back to really to the 19th
00:16:03.500 century when science began to take shape
00:16:05.540 in the form that we know it now and they
00:16:07.400 wanted to separate themselves off
00:16:09.020 understandably from superstition so I
00:16:11.540 didn't want anything to do with
00:16:12.530 something that sounds like the Biblical
00:16:14.150 Flood
00:16:14.570 for example they felt they would be
00:16:16.640 contaminated by that and they preferred
00:16:18.860 to explain any cataclysmic evidence as a
00:16:21.050 result of gradual processes so you
00:16:23.420 really think it's because of the
00:16:25.000 reluctance to accept religion or
00:16:27.260 religious ideas or to to separate
00:16:29.210 themselves I think that was the stuff
00:16:30.500 where it started or it started to
00:16:31.970 separate themselves off from that now
00:16:33.470 they've gone a long way from that and
00:16:34.940 many many scientists have got a vested
00:16:36.770 interest in what is called
00:16:37.960 uniformitarianism or gradualism and they
00:16:40.760 they don't like to hear about cataclysms
00:16:42.890 having any major impact on the story of
00:16:45.350 life on earth so is it sort of the
00:16:46.910 momentum of these initial desires to
00:16:50.060 escape religious influence that have
00:16:52.070 sort of led them down this path yes and
00:16:53.750 then there are others who have a vested
00:16:55.640 interest in current accounts of global
00:16:57.830 warming there's others who have a vested
00:16:59.930 interest in extinctions taking place now
00:17:01.970 they want to say that our ancestors were
00:17:03.800 responsible for the extinction of all
00:17:05.329 the mammoths and mastodons and so on and
00:17:07.220 so forth whereas the comet research
00:17:09.020 group scientists are saying no those
00:17:11.030 huge megafauna of North America were
00:17:13.400 wiped out as a result of the massive
00:17:15.290 series of impacts on the North American
00:17:16.819 ice cap I'm reading a book right now by
00:17:18.800 Dan Flores a really interesting book
00:17:20.569 called coyote America he's a wildlife
00:17:22.640 historian and he is really an expert on
00:17:25.670 all the different forms of Wildlife in
00:17:27.680 North America where they originated were
00:17:29.450 they migrated to and one of the more
00:17:31.400 fascinating things about it is he's
00:17:33.380 talking about all these animals that
00:17:34.760 went extinct you know ten thousand plus
00:17:36.560 years ago this mass extinction event and
00:17:38.570 never once does he bring up cataclysms
00:17:41.360 and and there's all these different
00:17:42.820 these different ideas and one of the big
00:17:45.670 being that human beings with addle addle
00:17:47.860 x' which is like really a very weird
00:17:49.930 sort of a spear throwing device wiped
00:17:51.970 out the woolly mammoths and all these
00:17:53.500 other animals and to me a posture it's a
00:17:56.140 lunatic idea also if you have any
00:17:57.760 contact with hunter-gatherers today you
00:18:00.610 find that hunter-gatherer peoples don't
00:18:02.200 over kill their game they they hunt them
00:18:04.240 respectfully they take what they need
00:18:05.590 and they leave the rest because it's a
00:18:07.270 renewable resource for them so I don't
00:18:09.100 think hunter-gatherers wiped out the the
00:18:11.470 mammoths in North America the evidence
00:18:13.120 is compelling it was the comedy well the
00:18:14.950 evidence that you brought up when you
00:18:16.270 were here the first time when you showed
00:18:17.590 the images of all those mammoths that
00:18:19.630 had been literally knocked over with
00:18:22.480 broken legs from the impact of something
00:18:25.240 on a mass burial grounds like these mass
00:18:28.330 did you know and not burial grounds
00:18:30.940 obviously but mass casualties mortality
00:18:34.540 sights mortality sites cool yeah that's
00:18:36.640 a good way of putting it yeah in fact
00:18:37.840 graham i visited one up in south dakota
00:18:39.550 called hot springs where there's just
00:18:42.550 several dozen nobody knows how many are
00:18:45.340 actually there but there's at least
00:18:46.480 several dozen two species woolly
00:18:50.050 mammoths and Colombian mammoths that
00:18:51.520 have been entombed and while we were
00:18:55.000 there I interestingly I you know the the
00:18:57.760 guide the woman giving us the tour there
00:18:59.770 was kind of giving the a gradualist
00:19:01.930 explanation at well over long periods of
00:19:04.000 time these mammoths wandered into a
00:19:05.620 sinkhole and were too dumb to get out
00:19:07.690 and so they became entombed and I asked
00:19:10.510 the question well what studies have been
00:19:12.670 done on the the sedimentary matrix in
00:19:15.220 which their remains are being found
00:19:18.060 because as I'm looking at this
00:19:20.170 sedimentary matrix I'm seeing a massive
00:19:22.330 deposit that in other words a deposit
00:19:24.760 that was instantaneous instantaneous and
00:19:27.370 when I brought that up she actually got
00:19:29.830 very irritated and wailing you all yet
00:19:32.290 dismissed my question didn't you know
00:19:34.840 what we've got it all worked out you
00:19:36.220 know we we know about that well what is
00:19:38.500 it
00:19:38.830 well you just we've got it all worked
00:19:40.660 out and it immediately went on with her
00:19:42.840 like but yet I had an article that was
00:19:46.720 actually written by one of the original
00:19:47.920 scientists worked on the site and he his
00:19:50.890 description was well it could have been
00:19:53.110 that but also as an alternative and he
00:19:55.720 used the term bloat and flow
00:19:57.700 that what you had was woolly mammoths
00:20:00.760 that had been caught in a flood drowned
00:20:02.980 and they're bloated carcasses floated
00:20:05.140 into a depression in the landscape and
00:20:07.510 that's where they were entombed and that
00:20:09.520 makes a whole lot more sense to me than
00:20:11.230 the fact that you know individually over
00:20:13.780 several thousand years these in these
00:20:15.910 mammoths wandered into this sinkhole and
00:20:18.010 then couldn't get out but you got to
00:20:20.440 bear in mind we're talking about you
00:20:21.820 know at the end of the last ice age a
00:20:23.380 hundred and twenty roughly species of
00:20:25.960 megafauna that disappeared which is
00:20:27.670 about equivalent to the same number of
00:20:29.520 megafauna species that inhabits the
00:20:31.720 earth today well as a short period of
00:20:33.580 time was something like 65 percent of
00:20:35.410 the North American mammals went extinct
00:20:37.000 75 / 75 percent a very short period of
00:20:39.700 time or a very short period of time
00:20:40.690 pretty much totally coincident with that
00:20:43.720 period called the Younger Dryas and so
00:20:45.970 there's nothing resembling what we're
00:20:48.550 capable of doing today back then I mean
00:20:50.590 when you look at human extinction events
00:20:52.330 human caused extinction events was very
00:20:54.640 logical and what we're doing today with
00:20:56.860 pollution and the expanse of
00:20:59.050 civilization and weapons are super
00:21:01.630 sophisticated if we wanted to we could
00:21:03.370 wipe out a lot of different species yeah
00:21:04.690 but what we're out of the least the case
00:21:05.860 actually seeing is that at the end of
00:21:08.260 what's called the balling allarod which
00:21:10.270 was the gradual warming at the end of
00:21:13.120 the last ice age that preceded the
00:21:15.880 sudden catastrophic change at 12,800 was
00:21:19.150 a de Clovis culture that existed for
00:21:20.980 three to five hundred years I think yes
00:21:22.900 somewhere but they suddenly were gone
00:21:25.540 right exactly simultaneous with the
00:21:27.700 mammoths and then there are interesting
00:21:29.560 studies that coming out now showing that
00:21:31.360 at least continental wide there was
00:21:33.850 apparently a major human population
00:21:36.160 crash exactly coincident with the
00:21:38.260 megafauna extinctions because you had
00:21:40.600 quarries that had been mined for
00:21:43.360 centuries that are suddenly abandoned
00:21:45.310 you have campsites that had been that
00:21:47.620 had generations of debris and toolkits
00:21:51.910 accumulating and so on debris from the
00:21:54.190 from the the fluting of the the spear
00:21:56.770 points and so on that are suddenly
00:21:58.390 abandoned right so the evidence actually
00:22:01.300 suggests that the human population
00:22:03.190 crashed which would certainly imply that
00:22:06.430 they would been far less capable of
00:22:08.260 wiping out all of these species of
00:22:10.420 MegaFon
00:22:11.170 also the the studies of their diet and
00:22:13.780 their life ways suggest that they were
00:22:15.430 very quite diverse they were
00:22:17.020 hunter-gatherers and they focus mostly
00:22:19.450 on small game they ate a lot of fish lot
00:22:22.210 of shellfish they gathered food and why
00:22:25.420 would they go after the biggest most
00:22:27.940 dangerous animal you know in the in the
00:22:31.300 whole in the whole array of animals and
00:22:34.510 with the incredible efficiency hunt them
00:22:36.490 to extinction in a hundred years it
00:22:38.230 doesn't make sense no it makes no sense
00:22:40.120 it seems pretty silly it mean ancestors
00:22:43.180 from that time if I may say Randall
00:22:45.040 mentioned the Clovis culture this is for
00:22:47.410 a very long time really until just a
00:22:49.330 couple of years ago all of the
00:22:51.280 mainstream academics in the fields of
00:22:53.410 archeology and anthropology were saying
00:22:55.060 there were no human beings in North
00:22:57.640 America before let's say 13,000 years
00:23:00.880 ago give or take five hundred years and
00:23:02.830 they came across the Bering Land Bridge
00:23:04.570 the Bering Strait at that time was above
00:23:06.760 water sea level was lower they entered
00:23:08.920 the Americas then they weren't hit there
00:23:10.660 before now in the last two to three
00:23:11.950 years there's just been a whole raft of
00:23:14.560 new scientific research and no scientist
00:23:17.170 today is prepared to defend the Clovis
00:23:19.510 model anymore it's accepted of course
00:23:21.610 that they've been human beings in
00:23:22.900 America for 50,000 60,000 years and
00:23:25.480 there's weird genetic links like for
00:23:27.340 example there's a trace that connects
00:23:29.910 Aboriginal Australians with North
00:23:32.470 Americans they had a common ancestor
00:23:33.880 it's a very peculiar thing that's going
00:23:36.400 on and so what what happens is that
00:23:38.230 actually these scientific models which
00:23:40.090 constrain and restrict research for so
00:23:42.250 long do get overthrown and that Clovis
00:23:45.130 model is being overthrown and what the
00:23:46.720 missing piece of the puzzle puzzle I
00:23:48.310 think for everybody working this field
00:23:49.810 is the Cataclysm the comet what happened
00:23:52.600 between twelve thousand eight hundred
00:23:53.890 and eleven thousand six hundred years
00:23:55.780 ago which changed everything
00:23:57.580 is it the bizarre to you guys or
00:24:00.040 frustrating in any way that this is not
00:24:01.720 a mainstream idea this is this very much
00:24:04.420 fringe but yet it's it's not something
00:24:07.150 that we don't have any evidence whenever
00:24:09.430 whenever I put out a book I'm I
00:24:12.010 immediately there's this huge hostile
00:24:15.190 reaction like the Michael Shermer thing
00:24:16.930 like the Michael Shermer thing like me I
00:24:18.550 mean I would say magicians of the gods
00:24:20.260 which I published in 2015 which deals
00:24:22.120 with this whole comet issue is actually
00:24:23.770 the most thoroughly
00:24:24.850 documented the most thoroughly
00:24:26.230 referenced book that I've ever written
00:24:28.000 it's calm its measured they actually
00:24:30.310 don't read it they just say Oh Hancock's
00:24:32.050 brought out another book he's a
00:24:33.160 pseudo-scientists that's what they
00:24:34.390 always call me or a pseudo archaeologist
00:24:36.310 and and it's obviously rubbish because
00:24:38.650 it disagrees with everything that we
00:24:40.000 know well that's the point of the
00:24:41.920 heretic in society is to offer an
00:24:44.110 alternative view and and well-documented
00:24:46.960 evidence but it seems that we're dealing
00:24:48.640 with such a deeply ingrained mindset
00:24:51.550 which is connected in curious ways to
00:24:53.890 power structures in our society that
00:24:55.450 it's very difficult to change it
00:24:57.040 absolutely like graham mentioned earlier
00:24:59.980 there's kind of a poet it went from a
00:25:02.170 religious motive I think in the 19th
00:25:03.970 century and now it's more a political
00:25:05.800 motive and again the idea that every day
00:25:09.490 you'll find something you know coming
00:25:11.230 from various factions that were
00:25:13.660 destroying the earth and the earth has
00:25:16.030 never suffered this kind of you know
00:25:18.700 assault on it before and and you know
00:25:21.940 we're causing the sixth great mass
00:25:23.590 extinction and we're going to cause
00:25:26.050 catastrophic global warming if we pump
00:25:28.420 another 50 or 100 parts per million of
00:25:31.180 carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and
00:25:33.400 and so what that is done is like many I
00:25:36.970 won't say many but several of the
00:25:38.530 scientists now that have been in the
00:25:40.390 forefront of criticising the Younger
00:25:43.450 Dryas impact hypothesis are also very
00:25:47.260 much involved in the global warming
00:25:49.510 movement and the idea that we are now
00:25:52.450 precipitating the sixth great mass
00:25:54.190 extinction having looked now at mass
00:25:57.340 extinctions and been really an obsession
00:25:59.950 of mine for about thirty years now I've
00:26:01.810 looked at everything from the
00:26:03.130 cretaceous-tertiary the Permian Triassic
00:26:05.100 you know right on down the line to the
00:26:07.900 most recent one which to me is really in
00:26:09.850 some ways the most interesting because
00:26:11.290 the most recent mass extinction that
00:26:13.030 we're talking about is the one that took
00:26:14.470 place while we humans were were part of
00:26:18.520 the of the story and between twelve
00:26:21.400 thousand eight hundred and eleven
00:26:22.390 thousand six hundred years ago the
00:26:23.830 Younger Dryas yes the Younger Dryas
00:26:25.300 which is still an unexplained climate
00:26:28.780 anomaly that happened and I mentioned
00:26:31.540 this I think in previous broadcast that
00:26:33.310 you know what you had was you had just
00:26:34.660 spasm of extreme warming followed by
00:26:38.470 rapid shifting into extreme cold
00:26:41.169 literally within a matter of a few years
00:26:43.360 and we're talking about climate changes
00:26:46.570 that are up to 15 degrees Fahrenheit
00:26:48.760 within perhaps 1 to 5 years which uh
00:26:52.299 turley Dwarfs anything that we've
00:26:54.070 experienced in the last since the
00:26:55.990 industrial revolution began and we still
00:26:58.870 don't really understand and that's why
00:27:00.760 this research is so important because
00:27:02.320 now we understand that there was
00:27:04.990 something cosmic that happened it's left
00:27:07.150 its imprint in the landscape over what
00:27:09.970 four continents five continents yeah
00:27:11.740 over over 50 million square kilometers
00:27:14.230 of the Earth's surface there's a giant
00:27:16.000 debris field of the this stuff that is
00:27:18.669 only produced by massive impacts these
00:27:22.210 things come in at 70,000 miles an hour
00:27:25.210 and you know if they have any diameter
00:27:28.390 at all if they're if they're 100 meters
00:27:31.330 or more in diameter they are they are
00:27:33.520 going to hit the earth really hard
00:27:35.169 they're not going to burn up in the
00:27:36.370 atmosphere and when they do they pack a
00:27:38.470 huge amount of kinetic energy a huge
00:27:40.330 amount of heat and shock and that
00:27:42.400 creates very definite chemical products
00:27:45.429 so nano diamonds so Carbon spherules so
00:27:48.250 melt glass that's like the Trinitite
00:27:50.470 that was produced in nuclear explosions
00:27:53.020 all of these when they're all found
00:27:54.820 together in the same layer of soil and
00:27:57.010 when you can put a date on that layer of
00:27:58.990 soil and when it's all over the world
00:28:00.970 there's only one thing can explain them
00:28:02.740 a massive cosmic it I don't understand
00:28:05.559 why this is controversial I really don't
00:28:07.690 I mean I do I understand it because I
00:28:09.520 know that once people start teaching
00:28:10.720 things once people start doing lectures
00:28:12.130 and giving speeches they want to stick
00:28:14.860 to their guns and they want to they want
00:28:16.299 to somehow or another avoid anything
00:28:18.669 that's going to contradict what what
00:28:20.289 they've been espousing it's a game this
00:28:22.960 is a game changer this information it
00:28:24.909 changes everything
00:28:25.929 it changes the way we've looked at our
00:28:27.700 past it changes the whole story of
00:28:29.650 archaeology and it changes the way we're
00:28:31.390 going to look at the future and I think
00:28:32.860 that people in academia are reluctant to
00:28:36.700 embrace that change and they're afraid
00:28:38.380 of being called pseudo scientists
00:28:41.320 because there's a whole lobby of
00:28:42.370 skeptics who use this word pseudo
00:28:44.380 scientist or pseudo archeologist as an
00:28:46.570 instant dismissal of other ideas and
00:28:48.820 those who are in the profession they
00:28:50.409 don't want to get tarred with
00:28:51.690 that brush they want to keep themselves
00:28:53.100 clean and I understand that but you're
00:28:55.019 talking about hard evidence yeah you're
00:28:56.940 talking about this nuclear glass you're
00:28:58.470 talking about nano diamonds you're
00:28:59.669 talking about core samples that show
00:29:01.169 this massive shift when you do the ice
00:29:03.840 core samples massive shift in
00:29:05.279 temperature and you're talking about
00:29:07.139 very clear evidence of impacts that we
00:29:09.450 know exist it's not like a comet's a
00:29:11.370 theory that's not like it's Bigfoot or
00:29:13.169 something like you know we're looking
00:29:14.700 for the final piece of evidence it shows
00:29:16.440 that comas real thing exactly it's real
00:29:18.539 it's Toth it's totally real but it's so
00:29:21.929 difficult for those who are invested in
00:29:24.179 other models to accept and unfortunately
00:29:25.860 they have the ear of the media it's the
00:29:28.080 it's there are or by the way all the
00:29:30.210 scientists in the comic comet research
00:29:31.950 group are absolutely mainstream
00:29:34.559 scientists and they have taken a lot of
00:29:36.840 flack from their colleagues for even
00:29:39.240 daring to investigate this area that's
00:29:41.220 why they've had no funding they've had
00:29:42.750 to fund themselves it's so well that is
00:29:44.970 so crazy because this is not a
00:29:46.710 controversial thing in my mind shouldn't
00:29:48.779 be it should not be this is not an
00:29:50.580 airy-fairy thing we're not talking about
00:29:51.929 psychics we're not talking about UFOs
00:29:54.149 we're talking about something we know
00:29:55.860 exists yeah so to bury your head in the
00:29:58.230 sand over something like this seems to
00:30:00.000 me invested in a process is interest
00:30:02.129 right now NASA is spending the
00:30:04.230 equivalent of one attack helicopter a
00:30:07.080 year on investigating the the Comet and
00:30:09.779 asteroid danger you know 50 million
00:30:11.490 dollars a year that's not that much it's
00:30:13.399 peanuts
00:30:14.580 it's a tiny it's a miniscule some
00:30:16.129 hundreds of billions of dollars on on
00:30:18.629 massive sophisticated military equipment
00:30:21.210 which we can use to slaughter one
00:30:23.129 another in ever more sophisticated ways
00:30:24.779 but just fifty million dollars a year on
00:30:27.330 saving the earth from from a potential
00:30:29.759 Cataclysm that could put our
00:30:30.960 civilization back into the Stone Age
00:30:32.879 tomorrow and I don't mean to keep
00:30:34.889 harping on Michael Shermer because I
00:30:36.570 like microwave but that he highlights
00:30:39.240 this sort of natural inclination to poke
00:30:43.139 fun at something that he has done no
00:30:45.210 research on whatsoever when I pointed
00:30:47.759 out gobekli tepe and I sent him some
00:30:49.320 articles from National Geographic
00:30:50.970 he went radio silent mm-hmm I mean he
00:30:54.299 should know about it it's astonishing
00:30:56.399 the people mocking it yeah he's gonna
00:30:59.399 mock it you should actually know what
00:31:00.960 you're mocking and to say that Gobekli
00:31:02.730 Tepe was created by hunter-gatherers
00:31:04.590 what I'm sorry that's just
00:31:05.639 theory that's not it that's not a fact
00:31:07.709 you seem very very sophisticated site
00:31:10.079 with astronomical alignments with
00:31:12.029 hundreds and hundreds of megalithic
00:31:13.619 pillars weighing up to 20 tons each the
00:31:15.570 world's first perfectly aligned
00:31:17.519 north-south building which you can only
00:31:19.349 do with astronomy this is it's not
00:31:22.169 enough to say oh they were just
00:31:23.249 hunter-gatherers there was something
00:31:24.690 strong from a half a mile away I mean
00:31:27.629 there's there's some serious
00:31:28.950 sophistication I mean what how big were
00:31:30.599 these stones well the the biggest one
00:31:32.849 actually still in the quarry they left
00:31:34.289 it because it had a fault in it they
00:31:35.639 clearly intended to move it 50 tons
00:31:37.799 you're looking at 20 foot high objects
00:31:40.259 and then it's the it's the putting
00:31:42.089 together of them see here's the problem
00:31:44.809 hunter-gatherer societies are not the
00:31:48.149 kinds of societies that produce
00:31:50.029 large-scale fixed monuments why because
00:31:53.009 they don't generate a surplus you can't
00:31:54.959 pay for somebody to become an architect
00:31:56.909 and for it
00:31:57.959 of those times somebody become an
00:32:00.119 astronomer you're busy hunting and
00:32:01.649 gathering and that's what you do
00:32:02.899 agriculture generates a surplus and
00:32:05.159 that's the bat is the problem at gobekli
00:32:07.200 tepe because there is no background this
00:32:09.599 site just appears out of nowhere amidst
00:32:12.059 what appears to be a hunter gatherer
00:32:13.469 community but what they're not
00:32:14.759 considering is the possibility we're
00:32:16.320 looking at a technology transfer that
00:32:18.629 the survivors of a lost civilization who
00:32:21.119 already had all that knowledge came to
00:32:23.700 go back Lee Tepe and use that site as a
00:32:25.979 center of initiation to teach the local
00:32:28.109 hunter-gatherers how to do agriculture
00:32:30.509 and that's now taken as the beginnings
00:32:33.089 of civilization I would say it is the
00:32:34.799 reinvention or the remaking of
00:32:36.929 civilization so when we're looking back
00:32:39.209 at Sumer and any artifacts we find
00:32:43.049 ancient Mesopotamia in that area Iraq
00:32:45.359 those are the people that are sort of
00:32:47.159 reinventing and relearning well that's
00:32:50.159 hence Oliver actually when we talk of
00:32:51.659 Mesopotamia which means between two
00:32:53.429 rivers the Tigris and the Euphrates
00:32:54.709 gobekli tepe is sitting right there in
00:32:57.329 the headwaters between the Tigris and
00:32:58.889 the Euphrates and we cannot separate
00:33:00.719 that from the later cultures that enter
00:33:02.309 history five thousand six thousand years
00:33:04.529 ago they're part of the lineage that
00:33:06.269 descended from gobekli tepe times and
00:33:08.999 what's fascinating about gobekli tepe is
00:33:10.799 the way it doesn't fit the way there is
00:33:12.899 no background to it that you would
00:33:15.179 expect to see them practicing learning
00:33:17.609 architectural skills the oldest
00:33:19.440 stuff should be the worst and as they
00:33:21.299 carry on it gets better that site ran
00:33:22.980 for a thousand years the best stuff is
00:33:24.990 the oldest a thousand years later what
00:33:26.909 they were producing wasn't so good this
00:33:28.769 is a real anomaly and it needs to be
00:33:30.419 investigated not mocked by skeptics but
00:33:32.639 actually explored to consider maybe this
00:33:34.679 does Rock the whole paradigm and it's
00:33:37.350 kind of ironic that in their desire to
00:33:39.779 get away from the ancient myths and
00:33:41.610 tales in the Bible they've ignored those
00:33:44.250 ancient myths and tales which all talk
00:33:46.379 about cataclysms well part of our modern
00:33:49.500 psychology is to imagine that we are
00:33:52.289 somehow so far advanced from our
00:33:54.779 predecessors that we now represent the
00:33:57.240 pinnacle of civilization and anything
00:33:59.279 that preceded us has to be looked upon
00:34:01.019 almost as you know as if the workings of
00:34:04.110 children it requires a major
00:34:07.099 psychological shift to admit or accept
00:34:11.129 that our ancestors have may have been
00:34:13.079 far far more sophisticated than than we
00:34:16.079 had imagined in our 19th century models
00:34:18.659 which basically still dominate thinking
00:34:20.909 today and you know in Graham's book he
00:34:24.060 devotes several chapters to the story of
00:34:26.069 one 19th 20th century heretic J Harlen
00:34:29.579 Bretz in his story to me kind of
00:34:31.649 encapsulates the whole the whole process
00:34:34.139 of forcing his paradigm shift and for
00:34:38.099 years he was out there exploring this
00:34:39.929 evidence that there had been this
00:34:41.040 tremendous flooding in Washington State
00:34:44.040 and all of his critics were dismissive
00:34:46.800 without ever even going out and looking
00:34:48.810 at the evidence firsthand in the field
00:34:50.609 but what he did was he stuck to his guns
00:34:53.520 for three decades and continued to amass
00:34:56.369 evidence to the point where they just
00:34:59.400 couldn't they couldn't dismiss it
00:35:01.319 anymore and finally a group of them went
00:35:04.800 out and began to explore the the
00:35:08.369 landscapes for themselves and one of the
00:35:10.470 leaders I think you talked about it in
00:35:12.660 your book James Gillooly who was sort of
00:35:14.880 the leader of the the skeptic faction
00:35:17.099 that had set out their sole purpose was
00:35:19.650 to discredit and lay this whole flood
00:35:22.349 heresy to rest once and for all but he
00:35:25.500 went out in the field and they spent
00:35:27.030 about eight days in the field where he's
00:35:29.760 seeing this evidence for himself over
00:35:32.400 and over again
00:35:33.240 and when you look at just one piece of
00:35:34.770 it you might be able to say okay there's
00:35:36.930 other explanations for that but what
00:35:39.570 happens is when you get multiple lines
00:35:42.150 of evidence all converging and there's
00:35:44.550 no way to individually explain away each
00:35:47.369 one of those things other than just
00:35:49.470 saying oh well it's all coincidence what
00:35:51.869 he this James Gillooly was honest enough
00:35:54.180 so that after a week out there they were
00:35:57.000 in a place called Palouse Falls in
00:35:58.619 southern Washington which was one of
00:36:00.570 these areas where these tremendous
00:36:02.609 inland tsunami swept across the land and
00:36:06.750 I actually just visited there about
00:36:09.720 eight weeks ago when I took a group of
00:36:11.430 people out there and and took them to
00:36:13.290 Palouse Falls to show them right on the
00:36:15.270 spot where James Gillooly was standing
00:36:17.550 when he finally had his epiphany divyam
00:36:19.740 images that that you brought with us I
00:36:21.540 have images I can dig them up here yeah
00:36:23.790 I sure do yeah I've got some really
00:36:25.980 interesting images to show you which
00:36:28.890 relates because see this flooding stuff
00:36:30.900 relates directly to the idea of the
00:36:32.940 impact and we can get into a little bit
00:36:34.980 of that explaining how how these
00:36:38.330 parallel lines of evidence are now
00:36:41.160 converging but the interesting thing
00:36:43.200 about but Gillooly was that in the India
00:36:47.570 descriptions of the trip he wandered off
00:36:50.609 by himself for a long time away from the
00:36:53.940 group and was standing here looking at
00:36:55.770 this massive cataract with 400 foot
00:36:58.680 cliffs in this little tiny ribbon of
00:37:00.960 water flowing over it in this huge
00:37:03.150 canyon below it and these big boulders
00:37:05.940 and he had seen for a whole week he'd
00:37:07.770 been seeing this stuff and it finally
00:37:09.869 got to the point where it wasn't
00:37:12.000 undeniable and he walked back to the
00:37:14.010 group and the words out of his mouth
00:37:15.839 verbatim were how could I have been so
00:37:18.510 wrong and he finally admitted and at
00:37:21.570 that that was like a turning point and
00:37:23.250 now and again Graham describes it's very
00:37:25.560 effectively in the book how in a way the
00:37:28.530 flooding phenomena was hijacked and then
00:37:31.230 placed within this more gradual istic
00:37:33.630 context to really to avoid the fact that
00:37:38.099 it was something so anomalous in so such
00:37:41.010 a departure from our modern experience
00:37:42.869 that we had to look outside of our
00:37:44.910 modern experience to find an explanation
00:37:47.130 what they wanted to do was find
00:37:48.900 something within our modern experience
00:37:51.060 and this is the the cornerstone of the
00:37:53.160 uniformitarian approach is that we look
00:37:55.920 for a modern example and then we
00:37:57.510 extrapolate backwards from that and so
00:38:00.570 what they did was they saw well in the
00:38:03.180 modern term in the modern world we have
00:38:05.190 Pro glacial lakes lake that's that form
00:38:08.250 in front of glaciers and sometimes these
00:38:10.050 Progreso Lakes might be held in by a ice
00:38:13.470 dam or another glacier these ice dams
00:38:16.440 will give away and they will cause
00:38:18.260 pretty catastrophic flooding they're
00:38:20.490 very common up in Iceland because you've
00:38:22.110 got several volcanoes under the law the
00:38:24.180 Icelandic ice sheets and up there they
00:38:26.340 use the term yokel ops to describe these
00:38:28.950 outburst floods but here's the thing
00:38:31.680 when you look at the modern versions of
00:38:33.960 it you basically are looking at floods
00:38:36.150 that are less than one thousandth of one
00:38:38.880 single flow from these floods we're
00:38:41.550 talking about that happened you know
00:38:43.860 twelve and thirteen thousand years ago
00:38:45.750 one thousand less than a thousand less
00:38:48.540 than a thousandth in peak discharge and
00:38:50.760 in total volume and and so it has been
00:38:54.270 admitted in several places I've
00:38:55.680 extracted the quote saying well we do
00:38:58.350 admit that this is a major extrapolation
00:39:01.080 upwards but never mind yeah you know was
00:39:04.890 it never mind is so disturbing me see
00:39:06.780 Holland breaths for 30 years was walking
00:39:09.810 the walk in the channeled scablands and
00:39:11.400 what he saw was evidence for as he
00:39:14.520 called it a humungous flood which which
00:39:16.980 actually Rosenthal within fell within
00:39:19.800 three weeks and and he went through
00:39:21.900 decades of being put aside by his
00:39:24.840 colleagues insulted they mocked him they
00:39:27.300 laughed at him just as the sceptics do
00:39:29.070 today but gradually the evidence began
00:39:31.200 to mount and they couldn't deny it any
00:39:32.670 more that there had been there had been
00:39:34.740 flooding and actually eventually they
00:39:36.180 gave Harlen Bretz Joe Holland Brett's
00:39:37.890 the Penrose medal which is the ultimate
00:39:39.690 you know the ultimate be stole of
00:39:42.360 geology in America he got the accolade
00:39:44.580 and he said at that he was aboard more
00:39:47.040 than 90 years old at that time and he
00:39:48.570 said at that time he said all my enemies
00:39:51.240 are dead so I have no one left to gloat
00:39:53.370 over but but the point is in a way there
00:39:56.670 was nothing to gloat about because what
00:39:58.200 they did was they they they
00:40:00.120 separated him from his central idea
00:40:02.130 instead of accepting that there had been
00:40:03.960 one huge flood and that was always his
00:40:06.360 view they said oh there must have been
00:40:08.400 70 or 80 floods that caused all this
00:40:10.770 damage and that's what we're that's what
00:40:12.780 we are seriously challenging right now
00:40:14.940 it's so ironic in a way that the human
00:40:17.520 desire for knowledge is what has led us
00:40:20.640 to where we are today we have this
00:40:22.620 insatiable desire for knowledge and for
00:40:24.720 innovation but that same human desire to
00:40:28.320 achieve is also what what's the the ego
00:40:32.460 is responsible for that
00:40:33.570 and the ego blocks anything that's
00:40:36.000 contrary to what you've already
00:40:37.320 established as fact exactly as soon as
00:40:39.750 you see something that might throw a
00:40:41.520 monkey wrench into the gears of what
00:40:43.320 you've been teaching and practicing your
00:40:45.330 whole life and I know that you've gone
00:40:46.950 through this with Egypt your your whole
00:40:48.870 issue with the Sphinx and with dr.
00:40:51.900 Schaack and John Anthony West was on the
00:40:54.120 podcast I was with you just recently
00:40:55.830 yeah he's amazing
00:40:56.640 by the way I'm going to be doing an
00:40:57.930 event in New York with John Anthony West
00:40:59.850 when on the 29th of November where it's
00:41:03.090 well it's in it again it's linked on my
00:41:04.770 website the details are on the talks and
00:41:06.960 events pages in its in some church
00:41:08.520 somewhere but I'm going to give a
00:41:09.570 presentation and then I'm going to
00:41:10.650 interview John live on live on stage
00:41:12.630 first time I've ever done that I'm kind
00:41:14.670 of podcasting you know in such a
00:41:15.990 character he's an amazing I love that
00:41:17.820 dude and in magical Egypt is I think one
00:41:20.970 of most important things anybody could
00:41:22.200 ever watch I think that DVD series is
00:41:24.300 just insane it's so spectacular and so
00:41:26.730 fantastic and next to going to Egypt
00:41:28.890 with that which I haven't done I think
00:41:30.900 that's probably the second best thing
00:41:32.280 just bet you back and John is an example
00:41:34.590 of why we need heretics this is this is
00:41:36.960 the thing you see that the science today
00:41:38.910 yes you're right we have this thirst for
00:41:40.800 knowledge and its case human
00:41:41.970 characteristic but also we get invested
00:41:44.310 in particular positions that when people
00:41:45.810 criticize those positions we take it as
00:41:47.640 an existential threat and where we beget
00:41:49.950 all angry and hot and bothered about it
00:41:51.750 if we allow that to happen too much we
00:41:53.400 don't keep a place for heretics in our
00:41:55.440 society then we're never going to do
00:41:57.390 anything novel we're gradually going to
00:41:58.860 get locked down ossified into the into
00:42:01.950 the existing system we need heretics
00:42:03.690 John has been the leading heretic on
00:42:05.580 ancient Egypt for decades pointing out
00:42:08.100 that we should listen to what the
00:42:09.450 ancient Egyptians said that their
00:42:11.490 civilization was not a divot
00:42:13.860 it was a legacy it was a legacy from the
00:42:16.410 time of the gods and that cast me back
00:42:18.120 again to this whole issue of a lost
00:42:20.010 civilization
00:42:20.820 now when gobekli tepe was discovered it
00:42:24.300 vindicated you in so many ways but what
00:42:26.940 are the possibilities if any of more of
00:42:28.860 these sites being explored and exposed
00:42:30.840 Amu's are there are there more that
00:42:33.090 people are looking at right now are
00:42:34.560 there any that are under the radar just
00:42:36.240 a year ago at the bottom of the Sicily
00:42:38.430 channel at a depth of more than a
00:42:40.560 hundred and twenty feet it's been
00:42:42.150 underwater for at least 9,000 years is a
00:42:46.320 huge megalithic site before the
00:42:49.320 discovery of Gobekli Tepe that site
00:42:51.690 could never have been explained the
00:42:53.070 dating is absolutely definite the Seas
00:42:54.720 rose and covered it at least 9,000 years
00:42:56.970 ago we don't know how long it stood
00:42:58.500 there before it was covered by the
00:43:00.330 rising seas but there it sits underwater
00:43:02.760 and I think underwater discoveries are
00:43:04.890 and I've had a part to play in this over
00:43:06.840 the years are one of the ways forward we
00:43:09.390 need to look at those areas because
00:43:10.830 there was a 400 foot rise in sea level
00:43:13.860 at the end of the Ice Age you're looking
00:43:15.930 at the amount of land that would be put
00:43:17.610 together in say Europe and China added
00:43:19.740 together that amount of land was
00:43:21.450 swallowed by those rising seas and
00:43:23.480 archaeology has largely proceeded
00:43:26.040 without taking account of those lost
00:43:27.870 lands I'm not saying they haven't looked
00:43:29.250 at all but they're primarily in marine
00:43:31.440 archaeology interested in shipwrecks now
00:43:34.020 this this megalithic site is there
00:43:36.150 images of this so we could look at there
00:43:37.620 are yeah yeah yeah I can I can probably
00:43:40.800 find it monolith at the bottom of the
00:43:44.580 Sicily channel try that try that a
00:43:47.070 search on that pull that up Jamie yeah
00:43:51.720 but so what does this look like is this
00:43:53.820 and is this been clearly established
00:43:54.990 that this actually is the work of man
00:43:57.150 this is not some sort of a yardang or
00:43:59.130 something of course there's dispute
00:44:00.690 right of course but the mainstream is
00:44:03.120 not going to just accept this overnight
00:44:04.500 but again it's mainstream scientists
00:44:06.000 have found it they're absolutely certain
00:44:07.500 that they're dealing with a man-made
00:44:08.670 site there are holes drilled through
00:44:10.020 these megaliths one of them is very very
00:44:12.900 large there's a series of other
00:44:14.880 megaliths around about it's not a
00:44:16.620 natural thing so here we're looking at
00:44:19.290 some of it right yeah so there's that
00:44:20.910 big big megalith broken into two parts
00:44:23.100 right there oh wow yeah and and and this
00:44:26.310 we can say a
00:44:27.660 often with archaeological sites the
00:44:29.310 problem is dating them you know for
00:44:31.980 example there are incredible megalithic
00:44:33.690 temples all over the island of Malta not
00:44:35.580 far away from this place incredible
00:44:37.320 megalithic temples but they can't date
00:44:39.990 the stone directly they have to date
00:44:42.060 organic material associated with the
00:44:44.130 stone and that can give them
00:44:46.500 misleadingly young dates in a case of a
00:44:48.540 site that's been covered by sea level
00:44:50.250 rise there can be no argument nobody
00:44:52.560 went down there and built that 9,000
00:44:54.570 years ago it had to be built before the
00:44:56.880 Seas rose and that puts a minimum age on
00:44:59.610 it of 9,000 years what are the best
00:45:01.500 images that we can look at because right
00:45:03.060 now I'm just seeing rocks it's very
00:45:04.530 difficult because I'm looking at so
00:45:05.730 that's I mentioned I'm afraid that's all
00:45:07.680 you're going to see those are those are
00:45:09.270 the best images of it that existed over
00:45:11.310 1 right above that that's in Yonaguni
00:45:13.350 okay that's not in that's not in the
00:45:16.410 Sicily channel so um what what are the
00:45:19.140 biggest pieces down there is it this
00:45:21.720 right here is this way yeah that big
00:45:23.370 thing big thing there I'm 30 feet long I
00:45:25.590 think and is it what what leads you to
00:45:28.590 believe that this is man-made the
00:45:31.230 scientists who worked on it the fact
00:45:32.910 that there are holes drilled through the
00:45:35.190 stone the fact that you can go to
00:45:36.780 neighbouring areas like Armenia and find
00:45:39.650 really very ancient megalithic sites
00:45:42.630 where they have exactly the same kind of
00:45:44.310 holes drilled through the stones and the
00:45:45.930 holes seem to have been used for
00:45:47.550 astronomical sightings now this sites a
00:45:49.830 mess it's been knocked over by the sea
00:45:51.450 it's fallen down but we're seeing the
00:45:53.220 same thing big megaliths with holes
00:45:54.840 drilled through them and you're also
00:45:56.100 dealing with 9,000 plus years of erosion
00:45:58.170 and barnacle arose all of it all of that
00:46:00.960 and the ocean is a difficult place to
00:46:02.370 work you know yeah it's it's it's not
00:46:04.800 easy visibility can be bad you're
00:46:06.390 dealing with currents there's all kinds
00:46:07.800 of all kinds of problems this is Britain
00:46:09.540 just cups Cameron this crazy little
00:46:11.070 submarine ring in James Cameron well I
00:46:14.040 spent seven years scuba diving or around
00:46:16.020 the world looking at this stuff and you
00:46:18.090 know it's pretty convincing in my view
00:46:19.470 well it is it does make sense that if we
00:46:22.020 do know for a fact and we do that the
00:46:24.390 sea level rose dramatically at the end
00:46:26.160 of the Ice Age it makes sense that some
00:46:27.720 things would be buried under the water
00:46:29.420 well in during the Ice Age whatever you
00:46:33.180 know you don't have to talk about
00:46:34.380 advanced civilizations or anything but
00:46:36.180 the during the Ice Age living on the
00:46:38.700 coastlines in establishing your
00:46:40.950 as communities everything on the
00:46:42.480 coastlines would have been probably one
00:46:43.800 of the most benign places to get you
00:46:47.609 know because for one thing you're down
00:46:49.020 near see the sea level this presence of
00:46:51.150 the Seas is going to you know smooth out
00:46:53.730 the climate and so forth so you know
00:46:56.250 you're going to have probably most
00:46:58.170 cultural development during the Ice Age
00:47:00.089 is going to be close to this to the sea
00:47:01.950 so it's going to be underwater now just
00:47:04.349 like Graham was talking about and so
00:47:07.940 this to me is probably the future of
00:47:10.820 archaeology as marine archaeology where
00:47:13.260 a lot of discoveries are going to be
00:47:14.609 made and in that particular thing I mean
00:47:17.010 there's a lot of megalithic structures
00:47:19.050 around the world that if you set that
00:47:20.880 thing up like this and put those citing
00:47:23.430 holes through it would look precisely
00:47:26.609 like scrape the barnacles off of it you
00:47:29.339 know and no one's saying oh it's proven
00:47:31.320 but what it is is we have to keep an
00:47:33.270 open mind and say well there are some
00:47:34.950 very strong similarities here so let's
00:47:37.140 investigate this thing further and
00:47:39.030 that's the whole point of all this is
00:47:40.349 all of this stuff needs more research it
00:47:43.589 doesn't need some Cavalier dismissal by
00:47:46.859 somebody who's you know protecting their
00:47:49.530 their own paradigm it needs more
00:47:51.510 research on all fronts I mean because I
00:47:54.089 think that there's enough evidence it is
00:47:55.980 now accumulated to suggest that there is
00:47:57.960 a deep history to the human species on
00:48:00.240 earth and we're just beginning to really
00:48:02.400 appreciate how much deeper really is
00:48:04.500 than the conventional models of history
00:48:06.270 and rather than just waving an arm and
00:48:09.210 dismissing this with a skeptical snare
00:48:12.720 with a skeptical sneer exactly oh it's
00:48:15.839 interesting is there's accepted
00:48:17.460 scientific models of humanity when
00:48:20.069 you're talking about supervolcano's
00:48:21.839 right like the super volcano of 60 70
00:48:24.270 thousand years ago towba yeah I mean
00:48:26.250 they're they pretty much accept that
00:48:27.990 wiped out of the vast majority of human
00:48:30.300 beings on earth mm-hmm and why is the
00:48:32.700 supervolcano hypothesis so easily
00:48:35.460 accepted but yet the asteroid impact
00:48:38.069 both of them are real events both of
00:48:39.990 them are historically documented in fact
00:48:42.450 we really don't we've never watched a
00:48:44.640 supervolcano take over the world but
00:48:46.290 we've seen asteroids hit other planets
00:48:48.960 we've actually watched shoemaker-levy
00:48:50.970 like you were talking about before we
00:48:52.290 call embodying Jupiter unbel
00:48:54.010 lievable bigger impact and the planet
00:48:55.870 Earth itself yeah yeah yeah exactly
00:48:57.730 exactly so yeah and actually more than
00:49:01.030 20 impacts each each each one of them
00:49:03.430 would have wiped out all life on Earth
00:49:05.020 if that if that object had hit the earth
00:49:07.120 yeah so you know so it's a it's a it's
00:49:09.640 very another thing too we were talking
00:49:11.620 about underwater structures but let's
00:49:13.090 also consider the possibility and again
00:49:14.740 john anthony west work is important here
00:49:16.690 let's also consider the possibility that
00:49:18.040 we have misidentified a number of
00:49:20.770 structures that are standing in plain
00:49:22.300 view like the great sphinx Egyptology
00:49:25.720 read any egypt logical text any
00:49:28.120 encyclopedia actually they will tell you
00:49:29.650 that thing was put there by a specific
00:49:31.330 Pharaoh Pharaoh Khafre of the fourth
00:49:34.660 dynasty round about 2500 BC that is not
00:49:38.680 a fact that is an opinion but it's
00:49:41.770 presented as a fact there is not a
00:49:43.240 single inscription that relates the
00:49:45.370 Sphinx to that fair or not a
00:49:46.960 contemporary experience Krypton not one
00:49:49.120 dating from 2500 BC in fact there's
00:49:52.780 nothing at all it's just the assumption
00:49:55.030 because it's close to a pyramid which
00:49:57.160 they assume the same pharaoh built again
00:49:59.920 on the absence of evidence that the
00:50:01.570 sphinx must have been built by them but
00:50:02.920 john anthony worse was the first to see
00:50:04.540 that actually when we look at the sphinx
00:50:06.790 we're looking at a highly eroded stone
00:50:09.010 object and that erosion is very odd and
00:50:11.770 that's why he brought professor Robert
00:50:13.360 Schoch professor of geology from Boston
00:50:14.890 University to Giza in 1992 to look at
00:50:18.550 the Sphinx and say what actually caused
00:50:20.170 this weathering on the Sphinx and shock
00:50:22.270 immediately saw it what caused it was
00:50:24.160 exposure to a very long period of heavy
00:50:27.400 heavy heavy rainfall and no such rains
00:50:30.940 have fallen in Egypt in the last five
00:50:32.980 thousand years but they did fall during
00:50:35.320 the Younger Dryas we had a prolonged
00:50:37.600 rain out from this comet impact as that
00:50:39.700 ice cap was pulverized and a massive
00:50:42.280 amount of ice water was thrown up into
00:50:44.290 the upper atmosphere prolonged rain ow
00:50:46.150 which could have been the cause of the
00:50:47.380 erosion on the Sphinx now what has
00:50:50.170 occurred new what discoveries have been
00:50:53.670 discovered in the last year like what
00:50:56.380 what is new that we can look at there in
00:51:00.340 terms of archaeology there's not much
00:51:02.530 new gobekli tepe
00:51:04.480 at the moment is in deep freeze it's
00:51:07.240 right 30 miles
00:51:08.200 from the Syrian border there's been
00:51:09.609 massive an unrest and unrest in
00:51:12.520 Chandelure which is that the main town
00:51:14.970 archeology is very difficult for them to
00:51:16.990 to carry on there it's basically just
00:51:19.380 frozen where it just sort of stopped
00:51:21.820 they've just kind of stopped you know
00:51:23.619 and in fact there's amazing number of
00:51:25.150 these of these sites another site I
00:51:26.890 visited from magicians of the girls was
00:51:28.780 bar back in the Lebanon absolutely
00:51:30.579 stunning site and again I'm convinced
00:51:32.470 that that site is nuanced it is yes
00:51:35.619 there is a Roman temple there but they
00:51:37.869 put that temple there because the site
00:51:39.400 was sacred long before and there's this
00:51:40.869 incredible u-shaped megalithic wall
00:51:43.390 which surrounds Baalbek which does not
00:51:46.540 appear to have any connection to the to
00:51:48.430 the Roman structure at all again that's
00:51:52.000 an area which is subject to tremendous
00:51:54.520 unrest and difficulty and it's difficult
00:51:56.410 for archaeologists to proceed but just
00:51:58.150 just in 2014 they they made a huge new
00:52:03.400 discovery at Baalbek of a buried block
00:52:06.190 which weighs one thousand four hundred
00:52:08.380 and sixty tons which was sitting there
00:52:11.140 on the site that they'd been working
00:52:12.490 that site for a hundred years they only
00:52:13.869 found it in 2014 Wow 1000 tonnes 1462 is
00:52:19.150 that two million pounds so that is like
00:52:21.099 I don't know it may be what math is
00:52:22.839 better than mine and converting it into
00:52:24.310 pole one times 2,000 pounds yeah 2,000
00:52:27.880 pounds to her to a turn to an imperial
00:52:30.520 ton so whatever and I had three zeros on
00:52:34.450 it double it and had 3 zeros on it it's
00:52:36.579 a horrendous amount of pounds to put
00:52:38.589 that way this it's a single largest
00:52:39.880 block of stone ever cut and quarried in
00:52:41.530 the ancient world and they found this
00:52:42.700 just in 2014 found it in 2014 now
00:52:45.190 there's another big one right beside it
00:52:46.750 which has been in plain view for about
00:52:48.609 the last hundred years and it's
00:52:50.589 astonishing to me that this one which is
00:52:52.150 just below it was covered by sediment
00:52:54.160 that we have a national calculator you
00:52:56.680 might be the only person unless I never
00:52:58.599 go anywhere without my calculator uh-huh
00:53:01.420 nobody has one of those we were just
00:53:02.770 talking about that yesterday you're like
00:53:04.599 who the [ __ ] assistant is an actual car
00:53:06.730 I'm the last guy take care of you when
00:53:10.900 it while the so Baalbek was also the
00:53:13.900 site of I mean there's many mountain
00:53:16.150 monoliths that have been discovered
00:53:17.380 there and it's really fascinating site
00:53:18.670 that most any people have sort of
00:53:20.200 overlooked
00:53:20.869 when you talk about ancient structures
00:53:22.210 absolutely I have to resist I I've got
00:53:25.549 nothing against aliens but I don't need
00:53:27.740 aliens to explain these things I I think
00:53:32.119 a much a much leaner and more elegant
00:53:34.640 explanation for these huge
00:53:36.200 archaeological anomalies is a lost human
00:53:38.240 civilization much better it has been the
00:53:40.400 case that I've been making for 25 years
00:53:42.950 I think the the alien thing is a bit of
00:53:45.529 a distraction but of course there's
00:53:46.759 aliens of course the universe is full of
00:53:48.499 life but the ancient archaeological
00:53:51.259 sites are not good evidence for that
00:53:52.940 idea that they're very unless you
00:53:54.859 massage the evidence a lot they're not
00:53:56.329 good evidence I think we are dealing
00:53:57.470 with a lost human civilization and at
00:53:59.210 Baalbek 20 feet above the ground we have
00:54:02.029 three blocks of stone join so closely
00:54:05.029 together that you can't get it edge of a
00:54:07.339 sheet of paper between them each one
00:54:09.499 weighs more than 900 tons and they are
00:54:12.140 20 feet above the ground it's a stun
00:54:14.299 it's a stunning achievement it's just
00:54:16.309 absolutely astonishing how on earth did
00:54:18.559 they do and how does mainstream
00:54:20.019 archaeology deal with that they say are
00:54:22.490 the Romans built it all are the Romans
00:54:24.349 yeah the Romans did it the Romans did do
00:54:27.019 some awesome stuff they did do some
00:54:28.549 awesome stuff they absolutely did but
00:54:30.499 this site is separate from the Roman
00:54:32.329 site it surrounds it but it's not part
00:54:34.190 of it in my view in terms of your
00:54:36.259 question what's happened within the last
00:54:37.670 year or two I would think that probably
00:54:39.799 the most significant thing or certainly
00:54:42.019 right up there would be the the comet
00:54:44.119 research and the discovery I mean like
00:54:46.309 this article I have right here which
00:54:48.019 came out in 2014 so it's not that old a
00:54:51.230 nano diamond-rich
00:54:53.269 layer across three continents consistent
00:54:57.289 with major cosmic impact at twelve
00:54:59.599 thousand eight hundred years ago and
00:55:01.759 it's something like 2425 highly
00:55:06.380 pedigreed scientists and these are the
00:55:08.089 comet research group gives scientists
00:55:09.920 from the comet research group who have
00:55:11.359 funded all their research themselves
00:55:13.400 they came out with another paper in 2050
00:55:16.009 where was this published if anybody
00:55:17.180 wants to read this that's in the Journal
00:55:18.380 of geology yeah but then there's the
00:55:20.420 Proceedings of the National Academy of
00:55:21.769 Sciences hosts a lot of their work as
00:55:23.930 well and the Proceedings of the National
00:55:25.460 Academy of Sciences get into trouble for
00:55:27.349 hosting their work but they feel it's
00:55:28.609 important so they keep on hosting it
00:55:30.079 this is so spectacularly confusing to me
00:55:32.720 because that's rocks
00:55:34.220 science yeah this is evidence it
00:55:35.990 actually can weigh this stuff you can
00:55:37.670 measure it you can you could run tests
00:55:40.070 on it and find out what its components
00:55:41.180 are this to me is so baffling yeah it's
00:55:43.970 very baffling they had brought out
00:55:45.440 another paper in 2015 I won't go into
00:55:47.630 the some of the details are boring but
00:55:49.580 it's called a Basie and chronological
00:55:51.080 analysis and basically what they're what
00:55:52.910 they were looking at is it they asked
00:55:54.470 themselves is it possible that this
00:55:55.940 evidence these nano diamonds these melt
00:55:57.740 glass the Carbon spherules could that
00:55:59.690 have been laid down gradually and the
00:56:02.210 chronological analysis that they've done
00:56:03.890 absolutely answers that no it was not
00:56:06.410 laid down gradually this whole thing
00:56:09.170 unfolded in a period of about 24 hours
00:56:11.180 whoa what a night yeah in what had
00:56:16.700 happened Joe was that for years
00:56:18.610 archaeologists had recognized this up
00:56:21.400 Ede black matte layer at about two dozen
00:56:26.840 or more of the Clovis sites around North
00:56:29.480 America which there had been over 50 of
00:56:31.820 them that have been studied and it was C
00:56:34.340 Vance Haines who wrote an interesting
00:56:35.840 paper saying that he was the one who
00:56:39.530 noted that below this black matte layer
00:56:42.110 which is only two to three inches thick
00:56:44.330 in most sites you found evidence of the
00:56:47.780 Clovis culture you found their toolkits
00:56:50.030 and their their spear points and so on
00:56:52.970 you found evidence of the extinct
00:56:56.150 megafauna but not above it you would
00:56:59.300 find this evidence of this cultural
00:57:02.450 activity and the megafauna right up to
00:57:04.670 the bottom of the of the black mat layer
00:57:07.820 but not above it so what finally
00:57:10.550 happened was in 2007
00:57:13.040 Richard Firestone and Alan West and some
00:57:16.310 of their colleagues and it was just
00:57:17.510 basically a small group at that point
00:57:19.400 took a look at this closer look and
00:57:21.470 that's when they began to discover these
00:57:23.600 impact proxies usually right at the base
00:57:26.510 of the layer and the layer itself is
00:57:29.060 carbonaceous which suggests that there
00:57:31.160 had been a lot of soot deposited which
00:57:33.560 would imply widespread wildfires factors
00:57:36.620 to study off the red off the coast of
00:57:38.900 California on the Santa Rosa Islands
00:57:40.910 that pretty much concluded that there
00:57:43.100 was just massive wildfires that pretty
00:57:44.780 much just annihilated everything
00:57:47.490 and then this was preceded by the
00:57:48.750 deposition of this black matte layer and
00:57:51.540 right at the bottom of this black matte
00:57:52.950 layer is where you'll find the nano
00:57:54.180 diamonds the magnetic grains the
00:57:56.430 microspheres the carbonaceous Ferrell's
00:58:00.320 fullerenes you find these impact proxies
00:58:03.570 and they're not all the same at all the
00:58:04.890 sites in fact that's been one of the
00:58:06.690 things that the critics have seized upon
00:58:08.160 but what they're doing is I think taking
00:58:10.800 an oversimplified model and when you
00:58:12.660 look at a comet fragmentation event you
00:58:15.450 could be looking at the individual
00:58:16.950 pieces could be have very different
00:58:19.380 compositions and what we were talking
00:58:22.620 about earlier the torrid meteor stream
00:58:24.590 I'm not convinced at this point it was
00:58:27.180 necessarily just a single impact event
00:58:29.220 it may have been a bombardment episode
00:58:32.580 that may have lasted even several
00:58:35.250 decades it may have then ceased for a
00:58:37.410 while and we were talking about this
00:58:38.970 last night over dinner that there seems
00:58:41.190 to be a second spasm at eleven thousand
00:58:44.220 six hundred years ago that's also
00:58:46.440 associated with a massive rise in sea
00:58:49.350 level they call there's two meltwater
00:58:51.450 spikes meltwater spike one a in
00:58:53.340 meltwater spike one B I'm quite
00:58:55.830 convinced that these meltwater spikes
00:58:57.600 that have been documented by marine
00:58:59.970 geologist and oceanographers are
00:59:01.800 correlated with these melting events of
00:59:03.990 the ice sheet that I've been looking at
00:59:06.060 in terms of their their geomorphic
00:59:09.920 consequences because some of these
00:59:12.360 events I mean the only way I can
00:59:13.770 describe some of these meltwater events
00:59:15.660 is that you the only modern analog to
00:59:18.240 this would be a tsunami and we've seen
00:59:20.400 some pretty devastating tsunamis within
00:59:22.770 the last decade or two both in Indonesia
00:59:25.770 and in Japan and I don't know if you've
00:59:27.270 ever seen any of like the videos of
00:59:29.070 these tsunamis anybody listening it is
00:59:31.710 definitely worthwhile to go online and
00:59:33.720 look at some of these videos where you
00:59:35.460 can actually see the the unbelievably
00:59:38.520 powerful effects of a 30 or 40 or 50
00:59:41.100 foot tsunami right now some of the
00:59:44.130 landscapes and I have a some images we
00:59:46.290 can pull up here shortly are places in
00:59:50.280 Montana Idaho Washington where you
00:59:53.910 literally had a tsunami sweeping over
00:59:57.180 the land there was over a thousand feet
00:59:59.340 deep and that tsunami came off the
01:00:01.380 I'm not an oceanic tsunami that's like
01:00:03.779 it's a freshwater tsunami
01:00:05.969 it's meltwater coming off this this
01:00:08.219 catastrophic melting of the ice sheet
01:00:10.019 and I've traced the sources of some of
01:00:12.749 these meltwater I've made two trips now
01:00:14.219 up into the into the plateau country of
01:00:16.440 British Columbia looking for the source
01:00:18.059 of this meltwater because in the
01:00:21.209 conventional models now of this this
01:00:23.459 flooding this that goes back to Harland
01:00:25.650 breaths and basically what they've done
01:00:29.039 is they said initially there could have
01:00:31.829 been no flood because Harlen Bretz
01:00:33.359 didn't provide a source for the water
01:00:35.400 they said the critic said well you're
01:00:38.190 saying that all of this evidence in the
01:00:39.599 landscape is evidence of the flood but
01:00:41.369 what was the source of the flood and he
01:00:43.229 didn't have a source so the critics then
01:00:45.390 said well you don't have a source for
01:00:46.559 the flood water therefore the flood
01:00:47.940 didn't take place then as as the
01:00:50.999 research evolved you had independent
01:00:53.489 evidence accumulating in western Montana
01:00:57.150 by JT Pardee who was with the US
01:00:59.699 Geological Survey and he was
01:01:02.219 investigating evidence that the mountain
01:01:04.440 valleys of western Montana had been
01:01:05.940 filled up with an enormous volume of
01:01:07.769 water and this volume of water seemed to
01:01:10.410 be exactly the same time as brett's as
01:01:13.469 floods he then assumed that this was a
01:01:17.279 giant lake and because you can see and
01:01:19.799 we can I think we have some images I
01:01:21.900 think Jamie has some images so we'll
01:01:23.339 pull him up shortly we're on the
01:01:24.690 mountain side you see the shorelines
01:01:25.979 itched you know a thousand feet above
01:01:27.989 the valley floor and what he then
01:01:30.239 decided was that based upon an old
01:01:32.420 nineteenth-century interpretation by TC
01:01:35.999 Chamberland that there had been an ice
01:01:37.829 dam he said well there must have been an
01:01:40.229 ice dam west of here somewhere in the
01:01:42.180 Clark Fork Valley a giant lake backed up
01:01:45.150 burst through the ice dam and then this
01:01:48.299 is what would have caused Harlen Bretz
01:01:49.920 'as floods so now the geological
01:01:53.219 community is shifting because number one
01:01:55.499 the evidence is overwhelming and they
01:01:58.259 can't deny it anymore but what they're
01:02:00.749 doing is looking for a gradualist or a
01:02:02.789 more uniformitarian explanation so they
01:02:05.009 immediately latched on to this well
01:02:06.869 there's a giant Pro glacial or in front
01:02:09.269 of a glacial lake in western Montana
01:02:11.989 well you're talking about somewhere
01:02:14.609 between
01:02:14.970 five hundred and twenty and five hundred
01:02:16.350 and fifty cubic miles of water that's a
01:02:18.870 lot of water right in in and normally
01:02:21.870 when you have a large lake you have a
01:02:23.310 huge catchment base and it is feeding
01:02:25.260 lots of streams and rivers that are
01:02:27.450 feeding into that lake when you look at
01:02:29.160 the any of the big lakes around North
01:02:30.900 America you have the lake and then you
01:02:33.120 have this big old catchment basin and
01:02:34.980 all of that's feeding in Lake Missoula
01:02:37.350 the whole lake fills almost the whole
01:02:39.720 catchment basin it's like to me what
01:02:42.810 they did was they said okay we're just
01:02:44.040 going to push the source of the water
01:02:45.360 from here over to here but let's not go
01:02:49.200 into the question of where did the water
01:02:50.550 come from that's filling these mountain
01:02:52.530 valleys of western Montana and this is
01:02:55.530 what I spent a couple of weeks in
01:02:57.710 September going up into some of these
01:03:00.600 following these valleys up into British
01:03:02.970 Columbia and there's spectacular
01:03:05.790 evidence and it's almost like the
01:03:08.790 American geologist stopped at the 49th
01:03:12.390 parallel and they say well that's the
01:03:14.760 Canadians preserve up there
01:03:17.070 we'll let them they've got their own
01:03:18.570 theories we've got ours interestingly
01:03:20.820 the Canadians are saying that we think
01:03:24.090 that the water for these floods came
01:03:25.830 from up here but they don't like that
01:03:28.740 because you see one of the leading
01:03:31.050 geologists who was saying that these
01:03:33.720 floods came from from Canada is John
01:03:36.750 Shaw who who basically came up there was
01:03:39.570 idea that drumlins which are these
01:03:41.690 inverted boat hull shaped landforms that
01:03:44.550 are found by hundreds of thousands in
01:03:47.820 regions where where glaciers were that
01:03:50.400 they were formed not by the glaciers
01:03:52.230 grinding over the landscape but they
01:03:54.120 were actually formed by massive sub
01:03:56.070 glacial flows of water and his critics
01:03:59.310 have all been saying well here's the
01:04:01.920 problem what's the source of your water
01:04:04.130 therefore it wasn't water wasn't sub
01:04:07.020 glacial floods is easy parallels the
01:04:09.960 Harlen Bretz a story very closely well
01:04:13.320 here's the thing
01:04:14.130 Shaw and his colleagues couldn't really
01:04:16.290 come up with a plausible explanation for
01:04:18.540 how you could form these massive sub
01:04:21.090 glacial reservoirs in fact what they
01:04:22.920 call the Livingstone Lake event required
01:04:25.050 eighty four thousand cubic kilometers of
01:04:27.300 water
01:04:28.260 and I eighty-four thousand kilometers I
01:04:30.510 can do it really quickly here we divide
01:04:32.700 that by 36
01:04:34.800 that's about 2300 cubic miles of water
01:04:38.970 that's more than all of the great lakes
01:04:40.950 combined vastly bigger than all of the
01:04:43.530 Great Lakes combined it's probably every
01:04:45.600 Lake in North America combined and he
01:04:48.000 said this one event required over two
01:04:50.550 thousand cubic miles of water well where
01:04:53.730 did that water come from
01:04:54.810 so he basically said well there must
01:04:57.359 have been a reservoir somehow that
01:04:58.950 formed his critics have said that's
01:05:00.990 impossible you couldn't form that much
01:05:03.450 water under the ice sheet well what's
01:05:06.780 happened now is the idea of a major
01:05:09.119 cosmic impact into the ice sheet has
01:05:11.580 completely obviated the need for a sub
01:05:14.700 glacial reservoir because now we have a
01:05:17.070 way of instantaneously melting enormous
01:05:20.010 volumes of ice it's no longer a mystery
01:05:22.440 when the water came from fully explained
01:05:24.450 and this has been the missing piece of
01:05:25.800 the puzzle until the comet research
01:05:27.690 group began to identify this evidence
01:05:29.580 well it's baffling to me that this is a
01:05:31.350 source of controversy because we know
01:05:33.030 that the Great Lakes were created by
01:05:34.290 melting glaciers we also know that
01:05:36.000 there's vast areas of North America that
01:05:38.250 are flattened by these glaciers you know
01:05:40.890 a buddy mine my friend Doug lives in
01:05:43.200 Cazenovia Wisconsin which is what's
01:05:45.180 called the Driftless area where the
01:05:46.790 glaciers didn't go through I just was
01:05:49.260 there in May it's peuta a it's beautiful
01:05:52.680 it's gorgeous give rolling hills and
01:05:54.960 it's just it wasn't it wasn't crushed
01:05:56.850 flat like other parts of North America
01:05:59.400 were right so we know we know that those
01:06:02.100 glaciers melted and they created the
01:06:04.320 Great Lakes I mean the Great Lakes were
01:06:05.880 from glaciers we know that that's an
01:06:08.040 established fact so why is all this
01:06:09.750 confusing I just don't understand why
01:06:11.310 they wouldn't just add that to it they
01:06:13.140 just can accept the great glaciers
01:06:14.940 somehow or another in the last 10,000
01:06:17.340 years
01:06:17.609 the glaciers just decided to stop
01:06:19.410 smashing North America flat and melt and
01:06:22.380 create these great inland oceans of
01:06:24.119 fresh water yeah yeah those are it's
01:06:26.609 it's very bizarre ultimately a lot of
01:06:28.830 ideology is is involved in this there's
01:06:31.380 there's that there's this desire also in
01:06:34.260 the modern world there's a desire not to
01:06:36.119 panic the public not to say things that
01:06:37.830 are that are going to cause that are
01:06:39.810 going to cause panic you
01:06:41.090 now with Donald Trump being president I
01:06:43.550 think people ready now I think people
01:06:46.040 are ready for panic I think so has
01:06:48.620 anybody debated you on this either one
01:06:50.360 of you on this well you know I tried to
01:06:52.310 Dan but not specifically on this I tried
01:06:54.380 to do a debate with Zahi Hawass who was
01:06:56.330 the guy who runs the Giza pyramids and
01:06:58.040 the madman yeah yeah total total I mean
01:07:00.320 very crazy event there's a video of it
01:07:02.690 online there's a video video of it
01:07:04.910 online the debate last what 30 second is
01:07:07.220 something like something like that yeah
01:07:08.630 yeah yeah and then and then later on
01:07:10.490 when he when he finally agreed to come
01:07:14.150 back into the room because he was so
01:07:15.470 angry with me walked out when he finally
01:07:17.120 came back into the room he was asked a
01:07:18.980 question about gobekli tepe and just
01:07:20.780 like you're skeptic he didn't know
01:07:22.670 anything about gobekli tepe or he
01:07:24.200 claimed not to know about I mean this is
01:07:25.610 that this is supposed to be the world's
01:07:26.900 most famous archaeologist and he knew
01:07:29.390 nothing about this incredible site in a
01:07:31.640 weenie in a neighboring country but one
01:07:33.560 point to make the Randall was talking
01:07:35.780 about the second event eleven thousand
01:07:37.400 six hundred years ago we're dealing with
01:07:38.690 an with with an episode of Cataclysm
01:07:41.090 begins twelve thousand eight hundred
01:07:42.830 years ago and ends eleven thousand six
01:07:45.260 hundred years ago both episodes
01:07:47.060 accompanied by massive floods and the
01:07:50.360 eleven thousand six hundred years ago
01:07:52.010 date I may have mentioned this last year
01:07:53.690 it's in it's in magicians of the gods
01:07:55.100 what's interesting about that is that is
01:07:57.230 the exact date that Plato gives us for
01:08:00.350 the destruction of the lost civilization
01:08:02.150 of Atlantis
01:08:02.810 Plato that's the only source we have for
01:08:05.630 Atlantis it comes to us many people
01:08:07.190 think it's all over the place but it's
01:08:08.540 not
01:08:09.020 Atlantis comes to us from the Greek
01:08:10.760 philosopher Plato who lived around 340
01:08:13.660 BC and he got the story from through his
01:08:17.149 family line from his ancestor Solon who
01:08:19.939 had visited Egypt in 600 BC and there
01:08:23.149 Solon was told of a great civilization
01:08:25.580 that had existed on earth that was the
01:08:27.140 progenitor civilization of Egypt but
01:08:29.450 that was destroyed in a terrible
01:08:31.310 Cataclysm and he asked are there
01:08:33.380 Cataclysm involving a gigantic flood and
01:08:36.050 Atlantis was submerged beneath the waves
01:08:38.510 and was never seen again and so Solon
01:08:40.310 said to the priests when did this happen
01:08:42.319 and they said three to nine thousand
01:08:45.200 years ago that was in 600 BC so that's
01:08:48.609 9600 BC that's eleven thousand six
01:08:51.020 hundred years ago that's melt water
01:08:52.430 pulse 1b how could they know
01:08:54.560 yeah how could we have to start taking
01:08:56.060 this stuff more seriously instead of
01:08:58.130 sneering at it and skepta sizing it out
01:09:00.200 of existence we need to leave a little
01:09:01.970 bit of room for extraordinary ideas
01:09:04.100 possibly being right that's the main
01:09:05.899 beef I have with the skeptics is that
01:09:07.580 they want to throw the baby out with the
01:09:08.839 bathwater I want to add something to
01:09:10.399 that in the Timaeus
01:09:11.930 you know Plato discusses Atlantis in two
01:09:14.510 dialogues and in two Timaeus he preface
01:09:17.990 'as the story of Atlantis by recounting
01:09:20.990 the myth of Phaeton now the myth of
01:09:23.120 Phaeton is a very interesting story and
01:09:26.170 basically what it is as Phaeton was the
01:09:28.729 offspring of hey Leo's the Sun God who
01:09:30.979 was raised didn't know who his father
01:09:32.899 was
01:09:33.710 his mother kept it a secret from him and
01:09:35.899 then one day he was being taunted at
01:09:37.490 school because all of his schoolmates
01:09:39.200 had you know recounting the great deeds
01:09:42.080 of their fathers and everything so he
01:09:43.520 went home distraught and finally his
01:09:44.839 mother said well actually your father is
01:09:46.580 the the big granddaddy of them all
01:09:48.609 Helios the Sun God so Phaeton decides
01:09:51.859 he's going to go and find his father and
01:09:55.510 eventually does and he goes to some you
01:09:59.450 know celestial realm or his father is
01:10:01.160 located and the way it is with the with
01:10:04.850 it with the Greek gods they have
01:10:07.580 unlimited powers except they also have
01:10:09.470 certain restrictions for example if a
01:10:11.360 God makes a promise he or she cannot go
01:10:14.750 back on it right so when hey Leo sees
01:10:17.900 Phaeton has his lost son come he's
01:10:20.090 overjoyed he says I'm so happy to see
01:10:21.980 you I will grant you any boon you want
01:10:23.960 and Phaeton says i want to drive the
01:10:26.840 chariot to the Sun I want to drive your
01:10:28.820 chariot and hey Leo says well I meant
01:10:32.860 anything you wanted except that you know
01:10:35.990 so it goes back and forth and back and
01:10:38.360 forth finally fate and convinces his
01:10:40.790 father let him let me do it his father
01:10:43.100 says look you've got to hang onto those
01:10:44.420 reins tight because those steeds are
01:10:45.950 going to pull away from you he gets in
01:10:48.950 there the gates of the Sun open it
01:10:50.930 describes in the myth you can go you
01:10:53.540 know you can read Edith Hamilton or
01:10:55.340 Bulfinch or any of the great retellings
01:10:58.070 of the Greek myths and they'll describe
01:10:59.390 it in there it goes through the signs of
01:11:01.970 the zodiac and then all of a sudden it
01:11:03.590 careens off and heads down to earth and
01:11:05.600 then it describes this whole litany of
01:11:07.130 catastrophe
01:11:08.000 setting the earth on fire and finally
01:11:10.910 the Jupiter at the the the beseeching of
01:11:16.700 Poseidon who is afraid that the oceans
01:11:18.470 are going to boil away get Zeus to mount
01:11:21.080 his his Mount Olympus and hurl his
01:11:24.260 Thunderbolt which knocks Phaeton from
01:11:26.660 the sky and he falls to earth and falls
01:11:29.780 into the river air adonis which is a
01:11:31.910 metaphor for the Milky Way and his
01:11:34.730 sisters the hell yachties then weep over
01:11:38.000 the death of their brother and their
01:11:39.680 tears fall to earth and cause the great
01:11:41.630 flood
01:11:42.200 Plato then after referencing that myth
01:11:45.920 he then says now this has the form of a
01:11:49.100 myth but what it really represents is a
01:11:51.770 declination or a declining of the bodies
01:11:54.590 in space orbiting around the earth in an
01:11:57.230 eventual falling to earth of one of
01:11:59.060 those bodies and a conflagration of all
01:12:01.490 things triggered by the fall of that
01:12:03.710 body it's intriguing that he mentions
01:12:05.420 the zodiac because because the torrid
01:12:07.340 meteor stream is so cold because it
01:12:09.530 appears to come at us from the direction
01:12:11.510 of the constellation of Taurus the
01:12:12.920 zodiacal constellation that's where
01:12:15.170 those shooting stars amongst which are
01:12:17.780 some very large objects that that have
01:12:19.580 hit us in the past and can hit us again
01:12:20.960 in the future that's where they come
01:12:22.310 from they come from that area of the sky
01:12:24.560 it's an actually an illusion it appears
01:12:27.410 that they're not actually coming from
01:12:28.940 Taurus it looks like that they come from
01:12:30.770 that area of the sky they come from that
01:12:32.690 area of the sky and so anybody in in
01:12:35.450 ancient times who was witnessing and
01:12:37.220 according to the Victor Clube and
01:12:39.950 William Napier and those guys who are
01:12:41.720 the British neo catastrophists that have
01:12:43.370 been doing all of this work for decades
01:12:45.080 on the toward meteor shower have
01:12:48.260 concluded that you know in times past it
01:12:51.320 was an extremely active shower and would
01:12:53.900 have created some pretty darn impressive
01:12:56.000 light shows even if it wasn't causing
01:12:59.440 catastrophes down here below but what
01:13:01.490 they've what they've conjectured is that
01:13:03.440 there might be times of multiple
01:13:05.210 Tunguska like impact bombardment when
01:13:09.130 you know there could because there could
01:13:11.090 be thousands of objects within the tarde
01:13:13.760 meteor stream on the same scale as the
01:13:15.800 Tunguska object and that if if you go
01:13:19.220 and you read the accounts the eyewitness
01:13:20.840 accounts over and over
01:13:21.840 and people are saying things like well
01:13:23.550 it looked like it was being discouraged
01:13:25.050 from the Sun it looked like it was being
01:13:27.300 born out of the Sun right it looked like
01:13:29.640 a second Sun in the sky like for a short
01:13:32.520 period of time the Sun had a twin right
01:13:34.440 well the summertime torrents are coming
01:13:37.290 from their parody lien passage around
01:13:39.390 the Sun so you like grain was saying
01:13:41.640 they make an elliptical orbit out to
01:13:43.860 Jupiter and back around the Sun in this
01:13:45.570 stream right earth crosses that stream
01:13:48.480 twice each year one time late June early
01:13:51.720 July we cross but at that point they're
01:13:54.210 coming from the direction of the Sun so
01:13:56.640 their their arrival to earth is going to
01:13:59.190 be very difficult to see because they're
01:14:01.110 coming from the direction of the Sun
01:14:02.610 right but that's exactly where on June
01:14:05.190 30th a torrid meteor would be coming
01:14:07.560 from and then also the fact that it's
01:14:10.260 that the perfect date for the peak of
01:14:12.030 the of the shower and the correct place
01:14:14.850 in the sky to me is pretty convincing
01:14:17.160 evidence that it was most likely a
01:14:19.290 remnant of that torrid stream the other
01:14:22.440 time that the earth crosses is late
01:14:24.480 October early November in fact we've
01:14:26.370 just passed out of it within the last
01:14:28.470 week basically but it Peaks
01:14:30.360 interestingly coincidentally between
01:14:33.270 like October 30th and November 4th or
01:14:36.210 5th so it's peaking right around
01:14:38.190 Halloween time in fact they've been
01:14:40.440 called the Halloween meteors and there's
01:14:42.420 some very intense I work sometimes thing
01:14:44.310 called the Halloween fireworks yeah but
01:14:46.470 there's some very interesting work done
01:14:47.910 by a researcher back around the early
01:14:51.300 20th century named grant Halliburton who
01:14:53.730 spent about 15 years researching the
01:14:57.570 connections between ancient calendars
01:14:59.790 and he concluded one thing very
01:15:02.310 interesting was that a lot of these
01:15:04.110 ancient calendars were being
01:15:05.550 synchronized by people's observations of
01:15:08.670 the rise and fall of the Pleiades which
01:15:10.860 is the shoulder of the bull the Pleiades
01:15:12.960 comprises basically part of that
01:15:17.120 constellations like Taurus yeah yeah the
01:15:19.500 shoulder of the bull and what he came up
01:15:22.440 with was that in his research he
01:15:24.570 discovered that many of these stories
01:15:27.600 that were associated with us like the
01:15:29.550 slaying of the celestial bull you know
01:15:31.880 Gilgamesh and Enkidu in the in the
01:15:34.260 earliest
01:15:35.400 known story they they fight the
01:15:37.950 celestial boulders many counterparts and
01:15:40.530 variants of that in mythical stories and
01:15:44.010 so what he then found out though was
01:15:47.010 that in many cases the that our modern
01:15:50.730 Halloween actually goes back thousands
01:15:53.640 of years to an ancient day of the Dead
01:15:56.100 that was observed all over the earth at
01:15:58.620 the same time every year even in the
01:16:01.020 southern hemisphere and it usually
01:16:03.590 revolved around a commemoration of the
01:16:05.940 the culmination of the Pleiades which is
01:16:08.040 when the Pleiades crosses the local
01:16:10.560 Meridian in other words it reaches the
01:16:12.540 keystone of the Royal Arch so to speak
01:16:14.850 up in the sky so if you go out on
01:16:16.950 Halloween now and you face the south in
01:16:19.140 the northern hemisphere you will see the
01:16:20.910 Pleiades right at midnight at midnight
01:16:24.330 they will be if you think of the the
01:16:26.030 arch of the zodiac as being a like a
01:16:30.720 clock it's right there at midnight at
01:16:32.640 midnight right well here's the
01:16:34.470 interesting link is that in all of these
01:16:36.630 myths
01:16:37.440 what halliburton discovered over and
01:16:39.600 over again was that the Day of the Dead
01:16:42.090 ultimately went back to myths about of
01:16:45.690 the destruction of the world by a great
01:16:47.940 flood and/or fire it's fascinating that
01:16:51.030 it's all coming out of the constellation
01:16:52.740 Taurus - and it's the celestial bull
01:16:54.930 that they're fighting in these ancient
01:16:56.070 myths and then all these cultures around
01:16:58.980 the worlds are celebrating the day of
01:17:01.140 the dead of this exact same time this
01:17:03.240 amazing stuff and right now our science
01:17:05.310 is closing its eyes to this I I think
01:17:07.440 it's fair to say with the torrid meteor
01:17:09.840 stream which is a very big issue in this
01:17:11.820 whole discussion that we are dealing
01:17:13.950 with a hidden hand in human history it's
01:17:16.050 something that is going to ultimately
01:17:17.700 require us to re-explain almost
01:17:20.100 everything that the skeptics hate it
01:17:22.320 they can't bear it because first of all
01:17:25.260 it involves cataclysms and secondly it
01:17:28.860 involves the possibility of losing a
01:17:30.690 whole civilization from the record it's
01:17:32.700 really it's really interesting when you
01:17:34.470 look at the dates of the this cluster
01:17:37.020 this episode of bombardment between
01:17:39.060 twelve thousand eight hundred and eleven
01:17:40.290 thousand six hundred years ago that's
01:17:42.270 the period that just immediately
01:17:43.920 precedes what mainstream academia think
01:17:47.160 of as the very beginnings of
01:17:49.190 civilization and they've just never
01:17:51.540 maybe if not even their fault it's this
01:17:54.330 is so recent this science is so new that
01:17:57.600 they've not had time to adapt to it but
01:17:59.550 if they adapt to it and take this into
01:18:01.320 account then suddenly what was an
01:18:03.110 extraordinary and absurd an impossible
01:18:05.460 idea that there was a lost civilization
01:18:07.670 twelve thousand years ago
01:18:09.840 becomes a very plausible and reasonable
01:18:11.880 idea and then we start once we can once
01:18:13.770 we take that on board then we can start
01:18:16.230 opening our eyes to archaeological
01:18:18.540 anomalies like the Great Sphinx like
01:18:20.850 Baalbek like submerged ruins like
01:18:23.550 gobekli tepe and begin to consider what
01:18:26.430 does all this mean are we in fact a
01:18:29.190 species with amnesia are we here
01:18:31.680 forgetful of the truth about ourselves
01:18:33.750 maybe that's why we're so [ __ ] up you
01:18:35.790 know because we just actually don't know
01:18:37.740 we've made up a story about where we
01:18:39.600 came from what we are I certainly think
01:18:41.520 it plays a part and I also think that
01:18:43.320 conservative skepticism is probably
01:18:45.120 prudent when you're dealing with most
01:18:46.410 scientific issues most things that come
01:18:48.480 up that people are claiming I mean
01:18:50.400 there's so many charlatans out there
01:18:51.990 crazy people that are claiming new
01:18:53.970 discoveries but uh in some cases they
01:18:57.060 examine these discoveries as long as
01:18:58.590 they're far enough away from us or weird
01:19:01.290 enough like this new planet that they
01:19:03.570 believe they're they have a 90 planet
01:19:05.580 sign in yeah yeah they they're pretty
01:19:07.740 sure there's something outside past the
01:19:09.690 Kuiper belt and they think it's massive
01:19:11.910 they think it's at least four times
01:19:13.410 maybe larger than the United States or
01:19:16.620 then excuse me the world down the world
01:19:18.000 and got an orbit of about ten thousand
01:19:19.770 years yeah and that's interesting with
01:19:22.020 comets because this huge massive object
01:19:24.810 circulating in the outer solar system
01:19:26.480 through the Kuiper belt which is the
01:19:28.680 source of many of the comets that hit
01:19:30.180 the earth is destabilizing comets from
01:19:32.790 safe orbits and putting them into really
01:19:35.400 dangerous orbits they come our way the
01:19:37.290 correctly from wrong but like what what
01:19:39.180 is the source of all these near-earth
01:19:40.770 objects do is this have anything to do
01:19:42.840 with earth one and earth two does it
01:19:44.430 have anything to do with the initial
01:19:45.540 impact that created the moon is that
01:19:48.390 because we were hit by another planet
01:19:50.190 right during the formation of the earth
01:19:51.510 and this is all scientifically
01:19:53.400 established Astro scientists or
01:19:56.330 astrophysicists rather and astronomers
01:19:59.100 all agree on that right there's a lot of
01:20:00.960 debris
01:20:02.250 would go back to that to that time and
01:20:04.740 but comets are another story because
01:20:06.420 they're coming in from the far reaches
01:20:08.190 of outer space they're coming they're
01:20:09.990 coming in from the Oort cloud and the
01:20:11.760 coital just vast distances away they're
01:20:14.250 their voyagers they're kind of messages
01:20:16.560 from the distant reaches of the cosmos
01:20:18.000 who come in in an unpredictable way
01:20:20.340 because their orbits are destabilized by
01:20:23.100 something like Planet nine isn't there
01:20:24.930 something called bodes law where you you
01:20:27.390 can measure the mass and the orbit of a
01:20:29.310 certain planet and you can accurately
01:20:30.660 depict where the next planet is going to
01:20:32.430 be and doesn't that fall apart somewhere
01:20:34.260 between Mars and Jupiter that's with the
01:20:35.730 asteroid belt yeah yeah yeah which would
01:20:37.950 indicate that something was probably
01:20:39.420 there what in the theory of the asteroid
01:20:41.310 belt that it was an exploded planet of
01:20:42.870 course there's a lot of opposition to
01:20:44.220 that theory too you know you're right
01:20:46.160 skepticism really has an important role
01:20:48.690 to play it's it's very it's really it's
01:20:51.360 really essential that we are skeptical
01:20:53.400 otherwise we'd all be following on
01:20:54.810 zecharia sitchin for the Anunnaki to
01:20:56.940 land exactly it would have sold our
01:20:59.040 houses December 21st 2012 we'd all be
01:21:01.680 going with the [ __ ] now I'm homeless
01:21:02.930 example years later I have to say
01:21:05.130 there's a skeptic called Michael Heizer
01:21:06.900 who has done really an excellent job of
01:21:09.590 thoroughly you know debunking the bogus
01:21:12.300 translations of zecharia sitchin is
01:21:15.150 wrong coms hitch in his wrong doctor
01:21:17.070 it's a very useful it's a very useful
01:21:19.500 site so we hated him and loved him at
01:21:21.210 the same time is so sad I love the idea
01:21:23.700 of the aliens come down and manipulating
01:21:26.190 the monkeys and making us to mine gold
01:21:28.110 it's a wonderful story but unfortunately
01:21:30.420 it's a work of science fiction it's not
01:21:31.680 a work of fact yeah we need I knew him
01:21:35.190 he was a fascinating man I once drove
01:21:36.810 him from Stonehenge to London we had we
01:21:38.700 had many conversations he was a deep and
01:21:40.650 serious researcher but I think he I
01:21:42.450 think he got he got carried away with
01:21:45.150 his own fence I also think that that
01:21:47.130 fantasy became very lucrative and it
01:21:49.170 also became a source of identity to him
01:21:51.720 yeah you know I followed him pretty
01:21:53.280 closely as well I've read the 12th
01:21:54.900 planet and I got really India's research
01:21:57.570 and this is in my early pot-smoking days
01:22:00.360 when I first started smoking pot so I
01:22:01.860 was I was all-in I was all-in and then
01:22:06.240 as I got wiser and then as I got not
01:22:09.960 honest maybe not wiser just I started
01:22:11.820 recognizing objectively why
01:22:14.590 these these things are so attractive the
01:22:16.590 fantastical is more attractive than the
01:22:18.849 practical and so something else again I
01:22:22.270 don't want I don't want to put Sitchin
01:22:23.440 down and I'm here also to say that
01:22:25.270 Sitchin did a lot of really good work
01:22:26.770 he's a clever guy and he had a lot of
01:22:28.750 very very very thorough research
01:22:31.869 I just lost my track actually smoking
01:22:33.400 too much dope where was I going what we
01:22:35.560 were talking about that all the
01:22:38.110 difference between the fantastical and
01:22:39.610 the practical that there's this
01:22:41.230 inclination to accept things that are
01:22:44.560 fun yeah you know that's what I was
01:22:46.630 going to say is that when you start
01:22:48.489 talking about the Anunnaki those from
01:22:50.290 heaven to earth cane these fantastic
01:22:52.570 creatures from thank you you've brought
01:22:54.219 my memoranda Bureau thing I remember I
01:22:55.929 was got to say what's interesting some
01:22:58.210 part because I know kind of once could
01:22:59.800 be good what was what's what's
01:23:01.900 interesting is that the level of
01:23:03.610 technology that Zakaria attributes to
01:23:06.639 the Annunaki oblique Nephilim that that
01:23:09.550 level of Technology is the level of
01:23:11.619 technology that we had in the 1970s when
01:23:14.739 we were you know NASA was doing its
01:23:17.560 stuff so it's NASA technology from the
01:23:19.360 1970s that is projected out on to that
01:23:23.860 is projected over a gram but is
01:23:25.270 projected out that is projected out on
01:23:28.030 to his theory of the past now it seems
01:23:29.949 to me very unlikely that the Nephilim or
01:23:32.260 the Anunnaki would have had for four
01:23:34.719 hundred thousand years which is what
01:23:36.159 he's saying the same technology that
01:23:38.050 NASA had in the 1970s is much more
01:23:40.030 likely that he's projecting that on to
01:23:42.130 the data rather than that it's actually
01:23:43.900 inherent in the dot there was also some
01:23:45.699 interesting ideas that he had that
01:23:47.590 turned out to be ideas that scientists
01:23:49.900 had also proposed about preserving our
01:23:52.060 atmosphere by by levitating or by
01:23:55.030 suspending reflective particles in our
01:23:58.119 atmosphere and that that is something
01:23:59.650 that the Annunaki in his books we're
01:24:02.349 going to use gold for because gold has
01:24:04.389 such unique properties which is why they
01:24:06.550 use gold to plate things because you can
01:24:08.830 take a little tiny piece of gold you
01:24:10.150 could plate this entire table goals are
01:24:12.310 really spectacular yeah a piece of I
01:24:15.460 mean there's nothing like it right
01:24:18.060 absolutely not there's a lot of really
01:24:20.590 good material in Szczecin but
01:24:22.179 unfortunately the translations of the
01:24:24.369 texts the translations of the texts are
01:24:27.010 not translations of
01:24:28.120 texe they misrepresent the text often
01:24:29.980 what he did was he took a
01:24:31.150 nineteenth-century translation and he
01:24:32.860 massaged it so that it would you know
01:24:35.770 fit his fit his argument and that's a
01:24:37.330 pity so we need skeptics and they help
01:24:39.760 us to sift out the wheat from the chaff
01:24:41.530 but but occasionally what the skeptics
01:24:44.230 do with this drive to to criticize
01:24:48.100 anything that's not mainstream
01:24:49.540 occasionally what they do is they let go
01:24:51.370 a really good idea which deserves
01:24:53.230 investigation and which the human
01:24:54.760 species could benefit from and that's my
01:24:56.380 feeling is with this amazing species
01:24:58.090 we've developed all this science why are
01:25:01.150 we why are we so ready to let go of
01:25:04.390 wonderful ideas well it's also
01:25:06.160 fascinating to me that because of what
01:25:08.590 Sitchin has been sort of criticized for
01:25:10.330 people now ignore the stuff that's
01:25:13.120 absolutely undeniable like the actual
01:25:15.040 stone tablets themselves the clay
01:25:16.900 tablets where you can see the depictions
01:25:19.660 of the solar system somehow or another
01:25:21.610 these people from 6,000 plus years ago
01:25:24.160 had a detailed map of the sources clear
01:25:27.040 idea of the source
01:25:27.820 what's the size in like a relatively
01:25:30.130 correct order in the planets in the
01:25:32.500 right place like they somehow or another
01:25:34.330 knew that Jupiter was bigger than Mars
01:25:36.640 they knew these things in some weird way
01:25:39.520 and we don't know why we don't know how
01:25:41.980 also the caduceus representing the the
01:25:45.280 the double helix of the DNA that's
01:25:47.920 really fascinating concept to that the
01:25:49.840 caduceus is used for medicine that's
01:25:52.360 used to reports that Gaia did
01:25:57.730 so it's kind of too bad there was so
01:25:59.950 much crazy involved in that I think what
01:26:02.080 any of us should do when we're exploring
01:26:04.120 the deep and hidden mysteries of the
01:26:06.010 past is is to go to a lot of different
01:26:09.010 sources go to a lot of don'ts just stick
01:26:11.110 with the mainstream don't just stick
01:26:12.640 with the alternative but try to try to
01:26:14.680 bring it all together and in a way
01:26:15.910 that's what I try to do in my books
01:26:17.410 accept the skeptics still hate them
01:26:19.150 yeah but it is so hard because it's so
01:26:21.910 it's so fun to go with the crazy story
01:26:24.220 yeah like the the alien story is so
01:26:26.740 compelling it's so fun very compelling
01:26:29.140 story I mean if we found some sort of
01:26:31.330 evidence of aliens it would be so
01:26:33.490 utterly spectacular even if it was a
01:26:35.650 simple alien like I've always said this
01:26:37.870 that if we felt like got a jellyfish on
01:26:39.520 the moon we would freak out
01:26:41.230 but you know there's really complex
01:26:43.180 bizarre things at the bottom of our
01:26:45.280 ocean that we've never discovered just
01:26:46.750 they're just not in the correct location
01:26:49.510 for us to be excited and then the other
01:26:51.489 the other issue we're getting slightly
01:26:53.320 off our flood topic here actually but
01:26:55.180 the other issue of entities that that in
01:26:58.780 the encounters with entities anybody
01:27:00.640 who's smoked DMT will know that as I
01:27:04.480 have as you have that will know that you
01:27:06.730 do encounter entities in the DMT in the
01:27:09.100 DMT state and they do communicate with
01:27:10.900 us and there's a lot of parallels with
01:27:12.520 the ETS or the aliens as they're
01:27:15.160 described in modern UFO abduction
01:27:16.989 accounts and Rick Strassman have you
01:27:19.510 ever had him on your show you know Rick
01:27:21.130 got sick he was supposed to be here a
01:27:22.930 couple of times we're trying to
01:27:24.190 reschedule it now yeah but he had some
01:27:26.140 pretty serious health issues now we had
01:27:28.300 a date scheduled out but I love that guy
01:27:30.520 got a chance to sit down with him a
01:27:31.780 couple of times and talk to him and of
01:27:33.700 course you presented DMT this molecule
01:27:35.560 yeah he's brilliant and he's so
01:27:37.270 important to me because I remember when
01:27:39.850 I did it I was so confused I mean it to
01:27:43.750 me it was like the first my first DMT
01:27:45.790 experience changed everything I thought
01:27:47.770 about the world and I immediately didn't
01:27:49.510 give a [ __ ] about aliens anymore right
01:27:51.100 like it was almost instantaneous like
01:27:53.020 before then I was like Roswell they've
01:27:55.060 got the they got the ship man yeah it's
01:27:57.190 in a hangar but what I encountered doing
01:28:00.310 DMT was so spectacularly alien it's a
01:28:03.070 pedestrian concept of something that
01:28:04.900 looks like a person but has a bigger
01:28:06.160 head enlarged eyes at high attack yeah
01:28:08.620 yeah it was weird and cool as it would
01:28:10.570 be if it was real it was nothing I mean
01:28:13.000 literally not one millionth as
01:28:15.040 interesting as what you absolutely can
01:28:17.410 encounter when you do DMT that's the
01:28:19.390 aliens that's the aliens that utterly
01:28:21.400 alien realm filled with alien
01:28:23.140 intelligences who communed and of course
01:28:24.700 again the skeptics say oh it's all just
01:28:26.200 made up in your brain but we don't know
01:28:27.580 that and Rick is open to the possibility
01:28:29.440 that we are dealing with areas of
01:28:31.660 reality that are not normally accessible
01:28:33.520 to our senses and that become accessible
01:28:35.380 to our senses by retuning the receiver
01:28:37.420 wavelength of the brain which is what he
01:28:39.489 suggests DMT does and I think I think
01:28:41.650 that's very plausible and at the very
01:28:43.060 least those who are interested in UFOs
01:28:44.890 and aliens should be also investigating
01:28:47.170 this line of inquiry can we can we use
01:28:49.750 changes in consciousness to understand
01:28:52.690 the majestic complexity of the universe
01:28:54.610 in which
01:28:55.030 we live and I think the answer is
01:28:56.260 definitely yes and many of Rick's
01:28:58.150 volunteers I paraphrase but they came
01:29:00.940 back with reports that the entities
01:29:02.710 who'd encountered them said we're so
01:29:05.020 glad you've discovered this technology
01:29:07.389 now we can communicate with you much
01:29:09.340 more easily you know it's fascinating so
01:29:12.789 there's a technology for encountering
01:29:15.250 other intelligences and against that
01:29:17.889 this mechanistic simplistic alien meme
01:29:20.619 that's going around now that they're a
01:29:21.849 bit like us but they came here in higher
01:29:23.530 tech the higher tech it's dull by
01:29:26.380 comparison with it is dull by comparison
01:29:28.090 if you're interested in anybody is the
01:29:29.920 book is amazing it's called DMT the
01:29:31.510 spirit molecule and he has a new book
01:29:33.550 that he's putting out about DMT and the
01:29:35.949 spirit and the soul of prophecy yeah and
01:29:37.989 he's just a really really interesting
01:29:40.750 guy but his his experience that he did
01:29:42.820 experiments that he did were the first I
01:29:44.650 think in many many decades to get
01:29:46.929 approved by the government correct so he
01:29:49.480 did everything above-ground I mean he
01:29:51.429 was above board he was did and because
01:29:53.739 it because it was government approved
01:29:55.300 the his remit was that he had to find
01:29:58.270 some therapeutic benefit for DMT and he
01:30:00.579 couldn't actually but that's not the
01:30:02.770 point
01:30:03.460 I'm sure actually there are therapeutic
01:30:05.469 benefits but that's not the point the
01:30:07.059 point is here is a tool for
01:30:08.619 investigating the mystery of
01:30:10.270 consciousness and the mysterious nature
01:30:11.889 of reality and I mean fact me if we get
01:30:14.349 five or six volunteers who haven't
01:30:16.150 compared notes or coming back with met
01:30:18.280 entities who said we're so happy you
01:30:20.139 found this technology yeah it's hard to
01:30:22.239 explain that as just to reduce it to
01:30:24.579 brain activity not only that when we
01:30:26.199 talk about things that are so big and
01:30:28.480 are ignored by mainstream culture this
01:30:31.179 is one that's just like that you're
01:30:33.130 talking about an endogenous human
01:30:34.750 chemical yeah that not only is in US but
01:30:37.510 is in thousands of different plants like
01:30:39.610 when how many different plants contain
01:30:40.960 DMT huge numbers huge very prosaic ones
01:30:44.139 like peas and you know well there's the
01:30:46.510 money recorder okay yeah that's what I
01:30:48.610 was gonna say the australian oriental
01:30:50.320 tree is actually illegal this isn't that
01:30:52.360 what would be the jerusalem the the
01:30:54.639 professors from the university of
01:30:56.020 jerusalem i believe that any shannon
01:30:57.550 yeah what they were talking about they
01:30:58.929 believe that that's what the story of
01:31:00.309 the burning bush and moses is so that is
01:31:02.559 Mimoza with the DMT and syrian rule with
01:31:06.610 the monoamine oxidase inhibitor in other
01:31:08.289 word
01:31:08.560 it's it's ayahuasca but a Middle Eastern
01:31:11.860 alternative of it doing the same thing
01:31:13.570 we like molecularly and isn't it
01:31:15.130 possible in some way that the idea of
01:31:17.050 the burning bush was them figuring out
01:31:19.030 how to dry or extract DMT never in it
01:31:21.580 very light very possibly right because
01:31:23.110 they're talking about the burning bush
01:31:24.340 producing God yeah and it just so
01:31:26.320 happens that this bush is the acacia
01:31:28.270 tree is incredibly common in super-rich
01:31:30.490 and DMT and it's all over the area and I
01:31:32.980 should probably insert at this point
01:31:35.050 that if you're at all familiar with the
01:31:36.700 Masonic ritual you'll know that the
01:31:38.440 acacia plant plays a central role that's
01:31:41.110 why you're one of them one percent Mason
01:31:43.330 characters every now every now it was
01:31:45.280 inside every now and then on face book
01:31:47.230 Randall I get accused of being a
01:31:49.480 freemason Hancock is a freemason as know
01:31:53.290 it explains as though it explains
01:31:54.850 everything I know lots of Freemasons I
01:31:56.830 spoken in Masonic lodges but I'm an
01:31:58.450 author and I shouldn't belong to clubs
01:32:00.100 you know I went to a few I went to a
01:32:02.170 wedding that my friend Duncan Trussell
01:32:04.060 was performing at for these two
01:32:05.830 Satanists and like 2003 into this day I
01:32:09.780 was the one of the lavas Anton LaVey or
01:32:12.850 Stanton Levay whatever is his son oh and
01:32:15.700 his son got married was some young
01:32:18.490 hedonist you know and they call
01:32:19.870 themselves Satanists and so Duncan
01:32:21.640 performed at this wedding and I went
01:32:23.770 there to this day
01:32:25.000 I get [ __ ] tweets about being a
01:32:27.340 Satanist so I can't join your little
01:32:28.720 club pal no one of your Masons I I need
01:32:31.540 to confess you Graham yes you didn't
01:32:33.880 realize this but I secretly initiated
01:32:36.220 you oh my god oh you're in so he get in
01:32:39.100 how do you self really initiate somebody
01:32:40.870 can you do that yeah no okay yes I sort
01:32:45.100 of did sort of so you could get him in
01:32:47.230 if you wanted to though right if you
01:32:48.940 know the people oh of course you even
01:32:51.430 you Joe I don't think something's gonna
01:32:53.170 happen bro I didn't I met a couple of
01:32:55.720 Masons they're very cool well most
01:32:57.490 masons don't really understand the
01:33:00.340 corpus of symbolism that's that they're
01:33:02.890 sitting on top of I got to say that not
01:33:04.870 to get off on the Freemasons but simply
01:33:06.730 there's a mass of symbolism and that's
01:33:09.490 the whole that's that's the thing that
01:33:12.160 they're custodians of and most of them
01:33:13.870 don't have a clue what it means but
01:33:15.700 they're doing an important job by
01:33:17.140 preserving this corpus of symbolism
01:33:18.880 through the through the layout of the
01:33:21.010 lodge
01:33:21.800 the the meaning of every component in
01:33:25.370 the lodge because it's a purely
01:33:26.840 astronomical allegory and then you have
01:33:29.420 the Masonic carpets and that's where you
01:33:31.070 have the whole story of the comet the
01:33:32.930 flood it's all there the acacia plant
01:33:35.000 it's all there it's all correct me for
01:33:37.220 my wrong but it's it's all also an
01:33:39.170 integral part of how Washington DC was
01:33:41.120 designed is that true yeah just so much
01:33:44.600 I haven't you know I honestly haven't
01:33:46.070 studied that okay but what I've seen is
01:33:48.770 that there's a there's a bunch of videos
01:33:50.540 where you can watch it where they sort
01:33:52.010 of describe how the layout you know is
01:33:54.590 in some way some sort of sacred geometry
01:33:56.480 I think what is based on Freemasons were
01:33:59.270 massively involved in the construction
01:34:01.160 of Washington as they were of many great
01:34:02.600 cities city I live in England has got
01:34:04.280 you know the major Masonic architecture
01:34:06.920 so is it like people like me like my
01:34:08.570 initial prejudice I hear something like
01:34:09.980 the Masons I got [ __ ] dudes in a cult
01:34:11.990 get out of here leave me alone like we
01:34:14.150 we assume that all groups of people that
01:34:17.720 follow anything somehow another wacky
01:34:20.500 Masons in my opinion they're largely a
01:34:22.670 drinking club for men mainly that's what
01:34:24.800 it is guys win at all but they do can
01:34:27.440 make special arrangements to bring women
01:34:28.700 into a lot of my life when I've get when
01:34:30.950 I've given a talk in a lodge I've given
01:34:32.720 talks in two or three lodges been asked
01:34:35.090 to do so then they make a special
01:34:36.890 ceremony to allow my wife Santa to come
01:34:39.050 in because I won't go anywhere without
01:34:40.100 Santa and so women can women can go in
01:34:43.760 but then there are more there are others
01:34:45.410 within masonry who are pursuing deeply
01:34:47.780 esoteric interest and exploring the
01:34:50.000 mysteries and you can have incredible
01:34:51.460 conversations and facet it's just
01:34:53.360 another another group of people who you
01:34:55.460 know are doing are doing their thing
01:34:56.750 it's not for me I wouldn't join I don't
01:34:58.520 I would lose I think if I joined
01:35:00.080 Freemasonry it would weaken me as an
01:35:02.600 author I think I think I'm better able
01:35:04.850 to comment on these things by not being
01:35:06.650 a member of any such group that's
01:35:07.790 interesting why do you think that well
01:35:09.830 because I think I have to remain open to
01:35:11.720 all possibilities and if I if I if I
01:35:13.550 commit myself to a particular line I
01:35:15.230 don't commit myself to a particular
01:35:16.520 religion I don't commit myself to a
01:35:18.890 particular men's club either I just
01:35:20.780 which is what masonry is I I think if I
01:35:23.150 commit that then a bit then ultimately I
01:35:24.740 would become a spokesperson for that and
01:35:26.720 I don't want to be that that makes a lot
01:35:28.700 of sense considering your occupation and
01:35:30.560 how important being open-minded has been
01:35:32.570 to your life it's vital
01:35:35.510 absolutely without it how could you have
01:35:36.980 ever done fingerprints of the guys I
01:35:38.420 could not you should have I mean and the
01:35:41.150 the thing the initial thing where you
01:35:44.000 were to tell me about Ethan that place
01:35:46.550 where they believe that the the Ark of
01:35:48.530 the Covenant lays which is one of the
01:35:50.989 most bizarre ideas ever and that was my
01:35:54.710 first book on a historical mystery with
01:35:56.239 the sign on the ceiling that's right and
01:35:58.280 when you go into it like it's so
01:36:00.530 interesting but I just I've always
01:36:02.929 imagined you as a young guy forced to
01:36:06.050 sort of reconcile with this bizarre
01:36:08.090 piece of evidence you've got these old
01:36:09.710 men that have cataracts in their eyes
01:36:11.599 like they're around radiation sites and
01:36:13.519 no one's allowed to go inside and see
01:36:15.440 this thing and they claim they have the
01:36:16.820 Ark of the Covenant in there and like
01:36:18.289 what the [ __ ] is in there I think was
01:36:20.900 the beginning of a magic it was the
01:36:22.130 beginning of a magical journey for me
01:36:23.570 it's been a magical journey for all your
01:36:25.190 fans too for guys like me man when I
01:36:26.929 read fingerprints of the gods it was to
01:36:29.030 me it was one of those books I just
01:36:30.710 couldn't put down and was so
01:36:31.699 mind-blowing and this is again was in my
01:36:33.500 the heart of my yeah fucking-a theorem
01:36:36.050 and fingerprints was published in 1995
01:36:38.329 and magicians came out in 20 in in 2015
01:36:41.000 and I would say in that time the the
01:36:43.909 evidence when I made the case for a lost
01:36:45.650 civilization and a global Cataclysm in
01:36:48.019 fingerprints of the gods I can't begin
01:36:50.570 to account for the amount of hostility
01:36:53.360 and anger and rage that I generated in
01:36:55.820 the academic community the idea was
01:36:57.139 considered to be absolutely absurd
01:36:58.849 twenty years later with magicians of the
01:37:01.159 gods
01:37:01.460 it's not so absurd anymore the evidence
01:37:03.650 is mounting we have incredible evidence
01:37:06.110 now for a global Cataclysm in exactly
01:37:08.900 the period that counts between twelve
01:37:10.489 thousand eight hundred eleven thousand
01:37:11.840 six hundred years ago and we have sites
01:37:13.130 like gobekli tepe we have a redefinition
01:37:14.809 of the Sphinx the whole area is just
01:37:16.849 about to explode in in the future we're
01:37:20.659 on the edge I believe of a paradigm
01:37:22.760 shift and this comet material is central
01:37:24.679 to it what I really appreciate about
01:37:25.909 your courage is that you've also had the
01:37:28.550 courage to admit when you've made
01:37:29.630 mistakes you're not you don't in any way
01:37:32.110 pretend to be some sort of a bearer of
01:37:35.750 secret knowledge no one else possesses
01:37:37.670 absolutely not a guru I don't want to be
01:37:39.530 anything like that I'm a reporter that's
01:37:41.570 that's what I am and I'm a reporter
01:37:43.610 who's reporting on offbeat subjects and
01:37:46.070 to some extent I'm an I'm an outsider so
01:37:48.469 one of the talks I do now
01:37:49.679 it's about being a being an outsider I
01:37:51.480 think there is a I think there is a
01:37:52.739 place for Outsiders in society well I
01:37:55.199 don't think you're an outsider I think
01:37:56.640 you're an outsider from the established
01:37:58.380 mainstream ideas I just think that is
01:38:01.560 what are the same we're both we're both
01:38:03.449 outsiders in that area I'm working in
01:38:05.070 different fields to get into this but
01:38:06.870 don't you think that these established
01:38:08.250 channels that were so deeply grooved in
01:38:10.290 distributing information those things
01:38:11.969 have widened so wide now what you're
01:38:14.640 getting I mean a professor could do a
01:38:17.670 podcast like he could teach a class you
01:38:20.280 could write a book or he can do a
01:38:22.290 podcast on a certain subject and like
01:38:24.780 you're aware of Dan Carlin and that
01:38:26.790 hardcore history podcast I just can't
01:38:28.650 stop raving about what he's done is
01:38:30.810 brought historical accurate but really
01:38:34.949 dramatic stories of real events that
01:38:37.650 took place to millions like you know
01:38:40.260 that's just that no one's doing that
01:38:42.120 like this is but it's not mainstream
01:38:44.400 well what's more mainstream than being
01:38:47.429 number one on the iTunes podcast list
01:38:50.280 which he is all the time what is more
01:38:52.440 mainstream and he must be getting
01:38:53.580 millions of downloads it's part of the
01:38:55.739 big change is taking place in our
01:38:57.060 society that the old structures are
01:38:58.650 being overthrown they're being thrown
01:39:00.480 away it's a very uncomfortable time it's
01:39:02.370 a very uncertain time is a very exciting
01:39:04.110 time right because we can build out if
01:39:06.090 there's something something amazing in
01:39:07.620 the future the Internet's had a huge
01:39:09.030 part to play in it the fact that people
01:39:10.469 can communicate with one another all
01:39:11.820 around the world since I've had a web
01:39:13.350 presence in the last I was late comer
01:39:15.780 but maybe 2 or 2 to 3 years ago I've
01:39:18.210 been getting contacted by I mean
01:39:20.699 professionals from around the world I've
01:39:22.830 got probably a dozen major ones I've
01:39:25.340 geologists who want to know more about
01:39:27.239 and interestingly you said earlier about
01:39:29.820 debating you know I'm always looking for
01:39:32.610 somebody to debate about that right I
01:39:34.409 you know because I have questions and
01:39:36.420 I'm thinking maybe somebody even
01:39:38.370 somebody who would disagree with me on
01:39:40.050 something good still help me answer some
01:39:41.880 of the questions right but I try to
01:39:44.820 associate as much as possible and hang
01:39:46.920 out with professionals in the field and
01:39:49.500 of course what I discover is that a lot
01:39:52.170 of them are working in these things
01:39:53.730 part-time almost clandestinely without
01:39:56.040 making it part of their you know if I go
01:39:58.350 on a field trip of geologists into the
01:40:00.570 flood lands none of them are really work
01:40:03.449 full-time it's all part-time you know
01:40:05.519 they're working for the government
01:40:06.510 they're working for the oil companies or
01:40:08.070 you know exploration mineral exploration
01:40:11.190 whatever they're doing this research
01:40:13.380 into geological catastrophes on their
01:40:16.949 own time right
01:40:18.719 but recently just last summer I got
01:40:20.670 invited to actually present some of my
01:40:23.369 research to the Atlanta Geological
01:40:25.920 Society which is the largest Society of
01:40:29.280 professional geologists in the southeast
01:40:31.320 so I jumped at the chance rather than
01:40:34.289 you know and so I presented hoping that
01:40:36.929 I would get challenged that somebody
01:40:38.340 would say wait a second there's a flaw
01:40:39.929 in your thinking you didn't happen so
01:40:43.050 did you make friends with some of these
01:40:44.570 mainstream geologists oh yeah well I
01:40:46.619 mean I've been known I mean I just took
01:40:48.389 a trip for um in September spent 10 10
01:40:52.590 days back out in the flood lines and I
01:40:55.309 did geologists with me on that trip so
01:40:59.190 yeah I'm getting to know more and more
01:41:00.719 people who are working as well you know
01:41:02.969 I I majored in geology and [ __ ] I still
01:41:05.599 am in touch regularly with the head of
01:41:08.489 the geology department I see her pretty
01:41:10.469 much on a regular basis and have been
01:41:12.119 keeping her apprised of some of my stuff
01:41:14.070 and she has off offered to sponsor me at
01:41:17.579 whatever point I think that I can pull
01:41:19.289 it together as a dissertation mm-hmm but
01:41:22.289 we'll see how that goes I mean my
01:41:23.940 objective was to learn geology not to
01:41:26.400 become a professional geologist that
01:41:27.959 wasn't interested in working for the
01:41:29.340 government or working for you know the
01:41:31.650 energy industry I had geological
01:41:33.570 questions and that's why I made in
01:41:35.340 geology and you've walked the walk and
01:41:37.139 in my opinion you know more about this
01:41:39.420 stuff than 10 fully PhD geologists yeah
01:41:42.599 you always freak me out so what's what's
01:41:45.479 fascinating to me about all this is that
01:41:48.119 I think what you've done has been very
01:41:50.940 measured you know everything you back up
01:41:53.190 with facts and photographs and
01:41:55.280 descriptions and disclaimers you know
01:41:57.570 when you when you say well it's it is
01:41:59.099 possible you will go down other various
01:42:01.079 paths you're not dogmatic about these
01:42:02.999 ideas but you've spent so much time
01:42:06.050 going over this I don't know if there's
01:42:09.989 another if there's a commensurate guy in
01:42:12.659 mainstream archaeology that has been
01:42:15.119 public about it the way you have been
01:42:16.710 because if there is I feel like we
01:42:18.180 probably would have heard about him your
01:42:19.469 podcasts have been the ones that we've
01:42:21.420 done they'd been seen by millions of
01:42:23.310 people they didn't listen to by millions
01:42:25.770 of people I mean the information is
01:42:27.750 getting out there and making a real
01:42:29.010 difference you're always going to have
01:42:30.690 the the guys like I think Michael
01:42:32.280 Shermer is very important and not
01:42:33.239 criticizing him but that knee-jerk
01:42:34.710 reaction to do something to mock
01:42:37.290 something or put down something that's
01:42:38.910 not mainstream like one of his tweets he
01:42:41.730 said you know what archaeology with
01:42:43.890 evidence is and he wrote archaeology
01:42:46.290 like why would you even tweet that this
01:42:48.390 doesn't make any sense like that someone
01:42:50.280 who's not paying attention to work but
01:42:51.719 made all you do is focus on Evan I'm
01:42:53.940 reminded of the Shakespearean line
01:42:55.410 methinks the lady doth protest too much
01:42:57.420 why does he need to say that it's got
01:42:59.370 the evidence you know it's like I see
01:43:00.719 tweet like Fox News saying fair and
01:43:02.670 balanced you know he's tweeting at you
01:43:04.680 with this yeah meanwhile your entire
01:43:06.660 book is based on photographic evidence
01:43:09.239 yeah and all the other various pieces of
01:43:11.460 evidence I mean that you're adding
01:43:12.630 documents to each other without
01:43:14.340 examining all these pieces of evidence
01:43:17.040 yeah it's not these aren't things that
01:43:18.780 you've invented no these are actual real
01:43:21.360 sites that you can look at I'm drawing
01:43:23.610 inferences from them that they don't
01:43:25.140 like that's the thing well what Robert
01:43:27.420 Schoch and guys like him are so
01:43:29.400 important guys who have the courage see
01:43:31.410 who's a Boston University professor
01:43:33.870 absolutely encouraged to look at the
01:43:36.120 stones and say this is the product of
01:43:38.700 water erosion too cute us - Robert
01:43:41.010 Schoch as a geologist as a career
01:43:44.010 academic geologist who's taken that risk
01:43:46.050 and put himself out there and followed
01:43:48.030 the evidence where it leads another one
01:43:49.560 is Danny Hillman Natta with judge' in
01:43:51.350 Indonesia who's been responsible for the
01:43:54.120 investigation of this extraordinary site
01:43:55.739 at gunung padang where work has been
01:43:58.560 stopped since 2014 again he's a highly
01:44:01.500 credentialed geologist he's Indonesia's
01:44:03.300 leading expert in megathrust earthquakes
01:44:06.060 but he's been looking at archaeology
01:44:07.830 bringing his geological expertise to
01:44:10.860 that so that things are changing we are
01:44:12.960 finding we are finding academics who are
01:44:14.940 willing to engage and willing to to
01:44:17.070 discuss I got into a very interesting
01:44:19.230 City email correspondence with a guy
01:44:21.180 called Daniel Loman at bar Beck but from
01:44:23.310 the German archaeological Institute
01:44:24.360 who's an architect and an archaeologist
01:44:27.360 and he was very civil with me and I he
01:44:29.520 answered my question
01:44:30.600 into it in depth we had quite a long
01:44:32.010 debate that's very refreshing that kind
01:44:34.350 of thing wasn't happening 20 years ago
01:44:35.670 yeah that is very refreshing now what
01:44:38.400 about those pyramids in Bosnia has that
01:44:41.070 been what is what is the deal with that
01:44:43.200 by those thing I've been there I know
01:44:45.720 Samos with magic personally Sam is the
01:44:48.060 guy who's promoted the site I like Sam
01:44:51.600 very much I must say when I'm in his
01:44:54.180 aura
01:44:54.780 I'm extremely convinced but when I when
01:44:58.260 I look rationally at the at the
01:45:00.570 so-called pyramids I don't think their
01:45:02.250 pyramids I think they're Hills I did
01:45:04.230 spend with Sam showing me around and it
01:45:06.180 spent three days in Bosnia looking at
01:45:08.790 the so-called pyramid of the Sun the
01:45:10.110 pyramid of the moon-- the love pyramid
01:45:11.880 and so on and so forth I do see that a
01:45:14.220 tourist industry has built up around
01:45:16.470 this and it's a fabulously beautiful
01:45:17.730 intriguing site and the massive
01:45:19.950 beautiful mountainous place but they are
01:45:21.870 Hills they are not pyramids impression
01:45:24.480 is given that there are tunnels
01:45:25.710 passageways inside the pyramids that's
01:45:28.260 not true the passageways are about two
01:45:30.450 two and a half kilometers away
01:45:32.100 they're very low-tech I just don't I
01:45:36.150 just don't see it and for that reason I
01:45:37.620 did not cover the Bosnian pyramids of
01:45:39.240 the magician's of the gods I'm not going
01:45:40.560 to say they're not pyramids I'm not
01:45:42.180 going to write a book saying that
01:45:43.620 they're wrong but I didn't excite me
01:45:46.110 enough to justify devoting a chapter to
01:45:49.170 them there's much more exciting and
01:45:50.430 important archaeological discoveries
01:45:52.530 that are being made like gobekli tepe
01:45:54.300 which need more space and there's some
01:45:56.610 there's some pyramid-like structures or
01:45:58.920 hills in China as well right there's
01:46:01.140 thousands of pyramids in China
01:46:03.300 cien the province of Zeon is just the
01:46:06.060 moment you land there four of your
01:46:08.280 aircraft you're seeing pyramids
01:46:09.450 everywhere I've been hearing that there
01:46:11.190 there are certainly hundreds and
01:46:13.170 hundreds of them distributed across
01:46:15.150 fields vanishing off into the distance
01:46:17.010 in all in all directions
01:46:19.440 they've been terraced and used as
01:46:21.750 agriculture but local farmers grow grow
01:46:24.780 crops on them I went there with Chinese
01:46:27.060 archaeologists they haven't excavated a
01:46:29.430 single one not one why not they said we
01:46:33.750 don't have this was nearly ten years ago
01:46:35.520 I was there they said they probably got
01:46:36.780 the money now but they said then they
01:46:38.100 didn't have the money they said we're an
01:46:39.990 old country we don't mind if we wait 200
01:46:42.570 years to get
01:46:43.740 with this it's crazy and the famous tomb
01:46:46.560 of the first emperor is part of this
01:46:48.690 pattern it is also a pyramid it has also
01:46:50.610 not been excavated the Terracotta Army
01:46:52.380 around it has been firm the Terracotta
01:46:54.660 Army is amazing oh yeah it was on
01:46:57.000 display somewhere wasn't it where you
01:46:58.470 can go and see it lie they did some kind
01:47:00.240 of trap I want to see that thing I'd
01:47:01.950 want to look at those things what what a
01:47:03.750 bizarre concept now these pyramids so
01:47:06.960 this one that this this Emperor was
01:47:09.390 buried and that had the terracotta army
01:47:11.310 was that a pyramid as well it is a
01:47:13.860 period it is absolutely it's a man-made
01:47:15.870 pyramid the Terracotta Army was buried
01:47:18.870 around its edges not in the pyramid
01:47:21.780 itself so the army was there to protect
01:47:23.280 him yeah to protect his soul into the
01:47:25.830 afterlife seems to have been the seams
01:47:27.450 have been the idea and then there's a
01:47:28.770 mythology that's come down that the
01:47:30.780 within the pyramid is a lake of mercury
01:47:33.270 that there are mechanical devices in
01:47:36.810 there which will fire arrows at you if
01:47:38.700 you go in that there's a whole story
01:47:40.350 about how how intensely protected it is
01:47:43.080 and up to this day it's not being
01:47:44.250 excavated that's so crazy
01:47:46.320 how could someone leave that alone and
01:47:48.000 you know even major archaeological sites
01:47:49.950 like Tiahuanaco in Bolivia for example
01:47:52.080 you'll find that only about 2% of the
01:47:54.060 site has been excavated I don't know how
01:47:55.770 we can draw inferences about the whole
01:47:57.480 site from from a tiny little fragment
01:47:59.310 fraction like that and that's the that's
01:48:01.080 the problem I think with archaeology and
01:48:03.000 it's why we have to you know consider
01:48:05.610 another way we're looking at an image of
01:48:07.590 the Terracotta Army now you know in
01:48:09.750 front of this pyramid and it is
01:48:11.820 spectacular now that I think about it I
01:48:14.670 don't think that was on display anywhere
01:48:16.650 I think maybe they had a couple of them
01:48:18.720 they brought some of them they came to
01:48:20.040 the British Museum there were a number
01:48:21.090 of museums Lee but it's so much bigger
01:48:22.650 than I thought it was you know I mean
01:48:24.660 there's I mean how many there's
01:48:26.220 thousands yes thousands of these
01:48:27.930 terracotta figures absolutely and this
01:48:30.510 period was made out of what was it Stone
01:48:32.850 round earth mainly okay so they just
01:48:35.910 sort of shaped the ground they just dug
01:48:38.430 around yeah they brought in earth and
01:48:40.380 turn it into a pyramidal Mound over the
01:48:42.630 but it wasn't just it's not massive
01:48:44.580 stone blocks it's not massive stuff
01:48:46.320 that's why they can grow crops on the
01:48:47.730 sides of some of these pyramid weird
01:48:49.650 yeah so they wouldn't build these giant
01:48:51.630 mounds of dirt and then dig holes in him
01:48:54.060 and support him well they probably
01:48:56.360 created the interior
01:48:57.990 you know subterranean as they were
01:48:59.970 building the whole thing mmm and they
01:49:02.340 just stacked dirt on top of it yeah wow
01:49:04.410 what a weird way to make a house yeah
01:49:06.450 and then we have to consider this with
01:49:07.860 you know with with archaeological sites
01:49:10.050 all all around the world is that any
01:49:12.120 site may actually not be the product of
01:49:14.280 just one culture but may have been
01:49:15.570 reworked and worked over and used by
01:49:17.400 many different cultures over this is
01:49:19.290 different periods stunning to me um I
01:49:21.840 found out about this because of a friend
01:49:23.670 of John Anthony West who was here with
01:49:25.140 him he showed me he lives in China and
01:49:26.730 he showed me some video of it and I was
01:49:28.350 like how do I not know about this I had
01:49:30.630 no idea there's this many of them also
01:49:32.130 here's one that's exposed what's this
01:49:35.390 controversial ancient pyramids of China
01:49:38.070 that one looks exposed blocky yeah well
01:49:41.940 that is a another thing about China that
01:49:44.490 we just don't have a clue when we when
01:49:48.150 we think about the the age and scale of
01:49:50.610 things we're so silly we've only been
01:49:53.160 around since you know in 1776 is when
01:49:56.010 the country was established it's not
01:49:57.300 really that long ago
01:49:58.380 you're dealing with China you're dealing
01:50:00.030 with literally thousands of years of
01:50:02.460 civilization all rising and falling and
01:50:05.670 taking place and adapting and growing
01:50:07.860 all in this one area mm-hmm
01:50:09.930 that's still in our eyes in a lot of
01:50:12.750 ways it's kind of behind right I mean
01:50:15.420 they're behind environmentally they're
01:50:17.460 behind when it comes to human rights
01:50:18.650 consider this the Portuguese in the late
01:50:23.100 1400s have rounded the Cape of Good Hope
01:50:26.160 and they've entered the Indian Ocean in
01:50:28.260 their little ships they've entered the
01:50:30.840 Indian Ocean and they actually establish
01:50:33.240 a huge Empire they go to Malacca they go
01:50:36.120 all over the place okay the seas are
01:50:37.980 open to them if they had come forty
01:50:40.200 years earlier they would have
01:50:41.610 encountered the Chinese treasure ships
01:50:43.310 ships that were 50 times larger than the
01:50:46.710 little caravels that the Portuguese were
01:50:48.810 sailing in Bastion you know what the
01:50:50.310 Chinese did at that time they went
01:50:51.420 through a period where they felt they
01:50:52.710 just wanted to give gifts to people and
01:50:55.170 they put together these huge fleets
01:50:57.240 carrying incredibly precious gifts silks
01:50:59.970 and ceramics and they took them all
01:51:02.370 around the Indian Ocean and they just
01:51:03.690 gave them to people so off the coast of
01:51:06.120 East Africa and in East Africa you can
01:51:07.800 find remains of this pottery from this
01:51:09.990 episode and then a Chinese emperor
01:51:11.820 came along and he closed the doors
01:51:14.870 burned all the boats shut everything
01:51:17.430 down and didn't let anybody speak to
01:51:19.290 China for 200 years whoa what a dick
01:51:22.220 well he he felt it was time for the
01:51:24.630 Chinese culture to turn inward yeah and
01:51:27.390 he they were afraid that they were that
01:51:29.280 their ancient culture on one and there
01:51:31.620 might have been maybe a laudable motive
01:51:33.570 in that they were concerned that the
01:51:35.520 ancient culture was going to get
01:51:36.900 contaminated by too much contact with
01:51:39.540 wasn't that generate cultures from other
01:51:42.060 places and that was a factor in it that
01:51:44.310 the constant desire to maintain the
01:51:48.180 current situation human we have to say
01:51:51.210 it's some kind of some kind of human
01:51:52.740 nature yeah for sure
01:51:54.180 I'd love to see some of these images of
01:51:55.770 it yeah let's look as the drone stuff
01:51:57.570 from the chemists that come as Prairie
01:51:58.980 and what what is it please
01:52:00.510 unless let's let's have a look at you
01:52:02.520 got that this Chinese parents are still
01:52:05.340 blowing my mind
01:52:06.270 they blow my mind as well I just can't
01:52:08.160 believe they haven't been asked
01:52:09.300 it's an eerie spooky scene I would I
01:52:11.430 recommend anybody to go to SIA not just
01:52:13.710 just it's incredible how many of them
01:52:15.900 there are and how unexplained it all is
01:52:19.410 and it's again it feeds into my general
01:52:21.060 point is we don't remember our past what
01:52:23.220 are we looking at here okay let's let's
01:52:25.140 can we pause so I can talk about what
01:52:27.450 we're looking at
01:52:28.260 yeah you look at this one that way you
01:52:29.640 could hit the mic right in front yeah
01:52:30.720 okay this is the beginning but okay what
01:52:32.370 here's what really I mic right up to you
01:52:33.930 that we're looking at a place in western
01:52:36.360 Montana called Camas Prairie and you see
01:52:38.850 some hills in the foreground and you see
01:52:40.620 a basin in the background right okay
01:52:43.770 right here on top of this hill and down
01:52:46.020 on the side here you see that there are
01:52:47.460 some coring operations those are coring
01:52:49.590 gravel because everything you're looking
01:52:52.140 at here this whole landscape between the
01:52:54.000 hills are these large masses of gravel
01:52:56.730 trillions of tons of gravel now what
01:53:00.420 we're going to do is we're going to
01:53:01.200 start sweeping around as the video plays
01:53:03.240 and you're going to load us down here a
01:53:05.730 series of ripples okay I see that okay
01:53:10.200 and I'm going to have Jamie pause in a
01:53:11.850 second but let's keep coming around you
01:53:14.070 start seeing the ripples on your
01:53:15.480 landscape let's pause right there right
01:53:20.160 there let's pause now I wish I had a
01:53:22.500 pointer but if you look up you're going
01:53:24.780 to see a flat
01:53:25.650 piece of land like a tongue coming out
01:53:27.930 rounded out Jamie's right here
01:53:36.140 that's it gets you a laser that's a
01:53:38.880 delta
01:53:39.690 that's a delta you know what a delta is
01:53:41.900 you ever heard of the Delta it's when a
01:53:44.700 river comes into a body of water and
01:53:46.860 it's carrying sediment and because the
01:53:49.050 river is moving along swiftly it's
01:53:51.030 carrying the sediment but when it comes
01:53:52.590 into the standing body of water it slows
01:53:55.230 down and it drops its sediment it builds
01:53:57.270 a Delta the whole city of Portland for
01:53:59.910 example is built on a giant Delta all
01:54:02.100 right
01:54:02.760 New Orleans is built on the Delta right
01:54:05.400 okay so what we're seeing there is a
01:54:07.170 Delta and then in front of it we're
01:54:09.360 seeing rippled landscape let's keep
01:54:13.380 coming around Jamie and so enfold
01:54:15.060 landscape that looks exactly like the
01:54:16.770 beach looks yeah keep coming around with
01:54:18.960 us the thing is fractal because this
01:54:20.760 this is the whole mystery of this that
01:54:22.620 this happens at a scale of inches on
01:54:24.060 beaches and a scale of hundreds of feet
01:54:25.950 here stop again okay Lord now right here
01:54:29.310 in the middle you see a massive Delta
01:54:31.410 yes you know like a big tongue splayed
01:54:33.510 out and then right down here you start
01:54:35.520 seeing the ripples and there's a
01:54:37.320 farmhouse you see the farmhouse then now
01:54:41.160 those ripples are the tallest ones are
01:54:44.070 about the height of a five-story
01:54:45.510 building whoa how does our keep okay
01:54:50.220 let's keep keep sweet swinging around
01:54:52.140 stop it stop this for a second um if you
01:54:55.260 don't mind are these things they're the
01:54:57.210 size of a five-story building what is
01:54:58.650 that like 70 feet or something
01:55:00.240 50 feet okay so that's those are 50 feet
01:55:03.360 high and how much water will we'll get
01:55:06.840 to that let's see let's see the rest of
01:55:09.420 it and these are just dirt right there
01:55:11.130 there well if you dig into one what
01:55:13.890 you're going to find is they're they're
01:55:15.150 a massive okay let's pause the game look
01:55:19.290 at this this is crazy this is totally
01:55:21.690 crazy this is one of the craziest things
01:55:23.580 you'll ever see this is these ripples
01:55:26.130 repeated ripples in an area where
01:55:28.530 there's nothing else like it this is the
01:55:30.180 fingerprints of the flood that's what it
01:55:31.830 is Wow
01:55:33.820 where can someone look at this how does
01:55:36.440 someone look at this in real you know
01:55:38.510 this right now this is what we're
01:55:39.860 looking at this is this video well my
01:55:43.400 colleague Brad young did this with his
01:55:46.670 drone and I think he's got it on the
01:55:49.699 website geo cosmic-ray
01:55:51.199 is this being played in the YouTube
01:55:52.639 video right now okay all right so the
01:55:55.010 YouTube people are cool with it if
01:55:56.059 you're listening on itunes we'll find it
01:55:58.489 find it on youtube but it's worth
01:56:00.770 looking at it's what my point this is
01:56:02.300 this is mind blowing [ __ ] and I think I
01:56:04.489 think you made the crucial point Joe
01:56:05.869 which is which is that we can understand
01:56:07.880 what this is because we can see it on
01:56:09.619 any beach we can see how water flows
01:56:12.199 receding across a sandy medium will
01:56:14.690 produce ripples but here they're on this
01:56:17.869 unbelievable scale where they're
01:56:19.520 hundreds of feet long and 50 feet high
01:56:21.260 where they dwarf houses and they're
01:56:23.389 lying all across and that - what that
01:56:25.130 tells us is that a huge water flow went
01:56:27.260 across this plane and did this you will
01:56:30.020 seeing it from this perspective love
01:56:32.000 which is a rare perspective unless
01:56:33.380 you're in a plane or helicopter or
01:56:34.880 something you get a chance to look at it
01:56:36.650 this way you really get a better sense
01:56:38.630 of what it is if you were on the ground
01:56:39.800 there you'd probably say oh look at all
01:56:41.360 the hills hard to see you don't quite
01:56:43.159 get the impression though we did visit
01:56:44.690 this this location and in to that day it
01:56:48.530 was overcast so you don't quite get the
01:56:50.570 effect like you do when you've got when
01:56:52.250 a low Sun angle mm-hmm really helps you
01:56:54.469 to see what what what's going on in the
01:56:56.300 landscape can I ask you is there a
01:56:57.889 dispute to this is there um no no nobody
01:57:01.130 disputes it nobody knows because this is
01:57:03.199 not from a flood not anymore
01:57:04.670 Wow no in fact it was this JT part let's
01:57:08.599 be fair nobody disputes that it was
01:57:10.340 caused by massive water flows there but
01:57:12.679 those same people would still not buy
01:57:14.329 into the notion that there was this one
01:57:16.099 humongous flood okay so they think into
01:57:18.320 the cumulative effect but this was all
01:57:20.510 created for the bottom of Lake Missoula
01:57:22.040 right yes and this is supposed to
01:57:24.199 actually represent the draining of Lake
01:57:26.119 Mazu right where as I argue from a
01:57:28.790 number of different reasons that this is
01:57:30.349 the filling right Missoula I have a
01:57:32.540 friend of mine who his friend lives in
01:57:35.270 Montana and they found a dinosaur on his
01:57:37.219 ranch allow yeah like really recently
01:57:40.059 goodnight
01:57:41.540 we should go back to that because
01:57:42.920 there's a connection yeah the well the
01:57:44.540 Great Western inland sea all that at
01:57:46.219 that area
01:57:46.820 there was this is a crazy place at one
01:57:49.220 point in time it still is arguable yeah
01:57:51.080 a different way the the water here Joe
01:57:55.940 that did this the way to visualize this
01:57:58.100 is to gain begin to think a tsunami you
01:58:01.040 have to think tsunami because the
01:58:02.420 tsunami is the closest scale of water
01:58:05.480 flow that we've experienced in modern
01:58:07.520 times no River flood has even approached
01:58:11.720 this well no no flooding any floodplain
01:58:14.660 nothing that we can put into perspective
01:58:16.040 right the closest the closest we can get
01:58:18.860 to it is a tsunami but even there you
01:58:21.290 got to picture the tsunamis that we've
01:58:22.940 experienced in the last decade and a
01:58:24.680 half and you know in in Indonesia in
01:58:27.080 Japan when they made landfall those
01:58:29.090 tsunamis were roughly between 20 and 50
01:58:31.760 feet depending on where you were
01:58:34.660 relative to the to the oncoming wave and
01:58:37.490 how far distance you were from it here
01:58:39.590 what you have to visualize is a tsunami
01:58:42.230 sweeping over the land that's over a
01:58:44.330 thousand feet deep that's that's what
01:58:47.330 happened here and we know that because
01:58:50.030 we can trace the the high-water marks on
01:58:52.970 the hillsides are clearly left the
01:58:55.040 high-water marks are clearly etched into
01:58:57.530 the into the hillsides so we now know
01:59:00.340 based upon the study of the ripples in
01:59:02.930 the water here was moving down it's
01:59:05.270 filling this Basin it's rushing in and a
01:59:07.670 great tsunami from the north of
01:59:09.410 freshwater meltwater coming off the ice
01:59:11.630 sheet and it's sweeping down over this
01:59:14.000 land at probably two or three hundred
01:59:16.160 million cubic feet per second which is
01:59:18.410 an inconceivable amount of water it's
01:59:21.200 it's many times in excess of every River
01:59:24.910 flowing on earth flowing today all at
01:59:27.770 once it's it's beyond that many times
01:59:30.020 ten or twenty times beyond that one of
01:59:33.050 the trickier things about water is that
01:59:34.670 water in itself it's kind of fractal in
01:59:37.280 some sort of a weird way when you look
01:59:38.750 at the actual molecule of water it's
01:59:41.240 almost like we don't we don't
01:59:42.380 distinguish it as being a fractal thing
01:59:44.150 because we see it as like this moving
01:59:45.890 phloem but if you're looking at the
01:59:47.090 actual molecules of water the cup of
01:59:50.000 water
01:59:50.450 Withey that you dip your fingers in
01:59:52.430 which is seemingly completely innocuous
01:59:54.440 and becomes this massive element of
01:59:58.370 change when the volume
02:00:00.489 is a thousand feet high and just rolling
02:00:03.190 over with massive amounts of weight
02:00:05.409 behind out
02:00:06.130 it's that same stuff massive amounts of
02:00:08.380 weight enough enough way besides that
02:00:10.599 it's actually causing seismic responses
02:00:13.539 is only imagine you know how much weight
02:00:15.969 are you talking about that can create
02:00:17.349 these 50 foot high walls but this what's
02:00:20.469 fascinating to me is that we don't have
02:00:23.110 we we don't have a scale like in our
02:00:25.809 minds as a reference like the difference
02:00:28.179 between that little cup and these
02:00:30.369 gigantic waves that you see that surfers
02:00:33.989 travel by jetski to get to you know the
02:00:36.489 off of a believe it's Mexico right ever
02:00:39.639 seen those massive waves they go way out
02:00:41.739 miles out to get to these crazy waves
02:00:43.749 and we ride them in there like 60 70
02:00:45.400 feet high like that's that's the
02:00:47.619 comparison almost like a glass of water
02:00:49.929 to those waves and then that to the it
02:00:52.719 scales up it scales up it scales up and
02:00:55.119 at a certain point it can change the
02:00:56.619 whole story of civilization almost
02:00:58.539 doesn't compute let you can
02:01:00.099 intellectualize it but it's almost not
02:01:01.809 computing one of these flood flows here
02:01:04.420 is three orders of magnitude greater
02:01:06.519 than the largest measured modern flood
02:01:09.880 in other words over a thousand times
02:01:12.280 greater in terms of peak discharge or
02:01:14.980 volume you would have to scale up at
02:01:17.710 least a thousand times greater than any
02:01:20.230 modern measured flood to get to the
02:01:23.710 smallest really of these flows here
02:01:26.499 because this is this is just one read
02:01:29.320 one place one locale of on five states
02:01:32.949 where you can trace the the literally
02:01:35.199 the ocean of fresh water sweeping across
02:01:38.559 the entire Pacific Northwest pretty much
02:01:41.650 washing away anything that was there
02:01:43.090 it's almost like we have a defense
02:01:45.070 mechanism built in where we ignore how
02:01:48.789 vulnerable we really are like we put it
02:01:51.099 maybe that's one of the reasons why
02:01:52.389 people are so reluctant to really go
02:01:53.889 deep into studying asteroid impacts
02:01:55.960 I think we're or even to pay attention
02:01:58.030 to this stuff like that this could
02:01:59.800 happen and this is I mean the those are
02:02:03.219 not two separate subjects because this
02:02:04.659 is the result of the comet impact on the
02:02:06.699 on the ice cap this this is the this is
02:02:09.159 why I feel that the research in this
02:02:11.440 field is so vital okay right there
02:02:13.330 yeah now here notice this is great
02:02:16.870 that's a beach we go but it's a beef
02:02:19.750 it's a beach for giant monsters yeah
02:02:22.240 what it is you can see in this here that
02:02:25.030 you've actually got three massive
02:02:26.890 currents converging here do you see that
02:02:29.980 over here right you've got a massive
02:02:31.990 current coming in that would be from the
02:02:35.440 west and then we're standing we would be
02:02:37.840 standing looking down current of course
02:02:40.330 this the the drone I'm guessing here is
02:02:43.060 about 200 feet in elevation so the top
02:02:46.840 of the water was another eight to nine
02:02:48.670 hundred feet above this perspective
02:02:51.190 right here and it's moving very very
02:02:53.950 fast and it's sweeping down into a river
02:02:57.670 valley that's down in those mountains
02:02:59.620 you see in the distance and from there
02:03:02.020 it's being carried down and joining up
02:03:03.730 other equally as large floods coming in
02:03:06.580 from other valleys and all of this is
02:03:08.740 happening at once and it's covering five
02:03:11.140 states basically and that's just one
02:03:14.170 region that's being affected by this
02:03:16.630 sudden catastrophic melting of the ice
02:03:18.700 sheets they are dealing with the largest
02:03:20.320 flood that ever occurred on earth it's a
02:03:22.060 simplest yeah this is insane
02:03:23.950 I mean it's insane look at it a lot here
02:03:26.050 in North America
02:03:27.040 and it happened twelve thousand eight
02:03:28.870 hundred years ago and it's story has yet
02:03:32.110 to be fully told isn't it possible there
02:03:34.600 was something larger before like the 65
02:03:36.550 million year ago one that hit the
02:03:38.200 Yucatan like what you know what kind of
02:03:40.510 an impact did that have well it actually
02:03:42.220 would because if dad had happened 12,000
02:03:45.460 years ago we wouldn't be him none of us
02:03:47.050 would be here yeah that'd be a wrap
02:03:48.910 right yeah that was a single large
02:03:50.470 oblique about six miles wide that was
02:03:54.190 that was a much more devastating impact
02:03:57.130 than the impact of twelve thousand eight
02:03:58.720 hundred years ago but nevertheless those
02:04:00.910 impacts of twelve thousand eight hundred
02:04:02.200 years ago were really really bad and
02:04:04.780 they did stuff like this and anything
02:04:06.220 that was in the way of this of these
02:04:08.200 massive flows of water would have been
02:04:10.420 rubbed completely from the story see
02:04:12.940 this all makes sense yeah and here's the
02:04:14.980 thing that the Michael schirmer's don't
02:04:16.360 get when you understand the extent of
02:04:19.270 this the scale of this phenomena and the
02:04:21.340 severity the unconceivable severity of
02:04:25.030 this in the aftermath
02:04:26.980 of an event like this what would remain
02:04:28.900 of a city of village a refrigerator I
02:04:33.130 know not a goddamn thing no nothing
02:04:35.860 nothing how much
02:04:36.790 what nothing would exist in the
02:04:38.170 aftermath of this and most things
02:04:40.030 wouldn't exist I mean you find like an
02:04:41.650 old refrigerator or car up on blocks in
02:04:43.780 someone's backyard in the south and it's
02:04:46.180 in 1970s and the the rot has gotten into
02:04:49.900 frame the H is gonna eat it up nature's
02:04:52.810 eating it up just a couple of decades
02:04:54.130 right what's it gonna be like in a
02:04:55.960 couple thousand years we should on exist
02:04:57.880 should not be surprised about how little
02:05:00.040 we really know about our past this is
02:05:01.960 also a comfort game with our ecology oh
02:05:03.550 yeah we've got the past all worked out
02:05:05.050 we understand it here is what we teach
02:05:06.700 in schools this is what our friends in
02:05:08.620 the media report this is the facts not
02:05:10.810 the facts we know nothing it's there's
02:05:12.880 been so much lost so many missing pieces
02:05:15.190 of the puzzle that we're you know
02:05:17.440 desperately trying to stitch together
02:05:18.940 and it's important I think that we
02:05:21.480 actually do get some clarity on events
02:05:24.520 like this because we still live on this
02:05:25.900 planet and we have kids and we have a
02:05:28.000 future and we want to hopefully want to
02:05:29.980 hopefully we want if one of those big
02:05:31.510 boys comes our way well that's that's
02:05:33.040 right but again I come I come down to
02:05:35.110 this which is which is that we are not
02:05:37.090 dealing with gloom and doom and the end
02:05:39.790 of the world we're dealing with a
02:05:41.050 problem that humanity should be
02:05:42.970 confronting we should not be sticking
02:05:44.470 our heads in the sand we should be
02:05:45.760 confronting this problem and that's why
02:05:48.640 I support the work of the comet research
02:05:50.440 group because they are the only people
02:05:51.790 right now who are confronting this
02:05:53.530 problem and really getting to grips with
02:05:54.970 it we should all confront I mean we
02:05:56.830 should absolutely all support them and
02:05:58.600 confront it because this if something
02:06:00.760 like this can happen once what's it's
02:06:02.530 what what really makes sense is how many
02:06:04.480 stories of floods there are in ancient
02:06:07.450 times and how many parallels there are
02:06:09.460 there are and how many there are from
02:06:11.890 North America tells dozens and dozens
02:06:14.200 yeah it was the Caitlin the Indian
02:06:18.520 artist who spent 30 years or so pre
02:06:21.550 Civil War I think maybe a decade after
02:06:23.470 the Civil War
02:06:24.190 painting Indians of different tribes and
02:06:26.620 he wrote a book called last Ram bolts
02:06:28.540 among the North American Indians very
02:06:30.370 very interesting book but what really is
02:06:32.410 interesting to me when I read the book
02:06:33.760 years and years ago was his final
02:06:35.590 conclusion of the book he says after all
02:06:37.150 of these different customs and
02:06:38.710 traditions that have been handed down
02:06:40.130 amongst these tribes they all have one
02:06:42.380 thing in common they all have a memory
02:06:43.909 or a story of a gigantic world
02:06:45.440 destroying flood and he and he this was
02:06:49.010 concluded tribes down into Central
02:06:50.630 America that he visited I I believe the
02:06:52.880 Americas are the repository that the
02:06:55.730 Native American peoples who have been
02:06:58.159 subjected to so much destruction over
02:07:00.650 the years they in their mythology their
02:07:03.949 traditions their memories they keep more
02:07:05.960 of this than almost anybody else
02:07:07.760 it's rit's rhe it's really tragic what
02:07:09.710 has happened in the Americas from the
02:07:11.000 time of the Spanish conquest the
02:07:13.010 deliberate destruction of knowledge that
02:07:15.050 the the terrible horrendous abuses that
02:07:17.389 Native American people suffered they are
02:07:19.190 our wisdom keepers they are the people
02:07:21.139 who passed down the oral tradition and
02:07:22.790 and remember the past so not only do we
02:07:24.949 have cataclysms wiping the human memory
02:07:27.500 but we ourselves actively get involved
02:07:29.989 in the human memory and wipe it we rub
02:07:32.330 it out the burning of the Maya codices
02:07:34.280 by the Spanish friars thousands and
02:07:36.260 thousand oh what was in those documents
02:07:38.150 yeah you know we might have had a whole
02:07:40.370 other story about ourselves if we could
02:07:42.409 have had access to those but instead
02:07:43.850 we're this destructive cannibalistic
02:07:45.440 species that just goes and smashes
02:07:48.500 everything to bits
02:07:49.520 it's a weird impulse that human beings
02:07:51.560 have is when they move into an area and
02:07:52.969 take over it one of the things they like
02:07:54.170 to do is destroy their icons destroy
02:07:56.120 every what's going on with Isis and all
02:07:57.920 these ancient Buddhist structures a
02:07:59.980 thousand plus year old beautiful
02:08:02.060 sculptures absolutely they're blowing
02:08:03.889 them up yeah you know and in yelling
02:08:06.350 praise God while they're doing it it's
02:08:08.060 really very bizarre it's a very bizarre
02:08:10.310 inclination that we have with it so it's
02:08:11.989 almost like we don't want people to know
02:08:14.179 you know it's as a bizarre almost human
02:08:17.150 instinct to wipe out the past and just
02:08:19.489 to constantly keep moving or was there
02:08:21.650 some trauma is there some collective
02:08:23.360 trauma some be please deeply suppressed
02:08:25.400 memory could be but that we that we
02:08:27.469 can't quite confront that's that's
02:08:29.360 exactly the thought I had because I
02:08:30.860 think that's the one way one of those
02:08:32.540 areas were Velikovsky finally really
02:08:35.060 nailed it was mankind in amnesia that
02:08:38.270 somehow we carry this the Trump because
02:08:40.699 once you begin to get to get a handle
02:08:43.130 and you get to get the picture of these
02:08:44.750 events as they occurred and did occur
02:08:47.060 and would have been experienced by our
02:08:48.429 ancestors you've got to understand what
02:08:51.560 would it be like to see you're entirely
02:08:53.210 young
02:08:54.060 completely obliterated starting over
02:08:56.970 again from basically a barren mud filled
02:08:59.220 hmm you know were you
02:09:01.440 that's essentially what these people
02:09:02.610 were faced if they lived at all and so
02:09:04.800 fabulously they did because where we are
02:09:07.080 but you know again the evidence is
02:09:09.240 emerging of major cultural collapse if
02:09:11.700 you had a guess what percentage of the
02:09:13.770 population of human beings just as
02:09:15.510 obviously just a guess but how many do
02:09:17.340 you think were wiped out half of them
02:09:20.480 three-quarters of them I don't think
02:09:22.200 that would be unrealistic no it doesn't
02:09:24.120 seem like it would be and if it was that
02:09:25.680 number and those people that's enough
02:09:28.140 for people to survive and if it was that
02:09:30.360 number boy what a strange [ __ ]
02:09:33.090 mythical past they would have the other
02:09:35.790 the other thing that bear in mind is in
02:09:38.070 the world today our world we have an
02:09:40.560 advanced civilization America you know
02:09:43.980 Germany that the industrialized
02:09:46.770 technological countries and we have
02:09:48.750 coexisting with them in South America in
02:09:52.170 the the Namibian desert we have
02:09:54.720 hunter-gatherers so the the notion that
02:09:57.090 hunter-gatherers and an advanced
02:09:59.310 civilization might coexist right in the
02:10:02.310 same epoch of history should not be
02:10:03.780 strange to us because we're doing that
02:10:05.700 today and that's what I would suggest
02:10:07.740 happened before twelve thousand eight
02:10:10.140 hundred years ago before the Cataclysm
02:10:11.760 of twelve thousand eight hundred years
02:10:12.900 ago that there was a fairly advanced
02:10:15.180 civilization that was capable of mapping
02:10:16.980 and exploring the world creating
02:10:19.200 gigantic works of architecture and it
02:10:21.210 coexisted with hunter-gatherers and who
02:10:24.060 were the ones who survived the Cataclysm
02:10:26.190 the answer is the ones who survived the
02:10:28.860 Cataclysm were the hunter-gatherers not
02:10:31.440 the sophisticated people's a few of them
02:10:33.540 survived and they then settled amongst
02:10:35.340 the hunter-gatherers and tried to
02:10:36.660 transfer some of their knowledge and
02:10:38.280 skills to them and it's the same today
02:10:40.470 if we if we were to have a repeat of the
02:10:43.740 Younger Dryas Cataclysm today I don't
02:10:46.050 think that people from Los Angeles or
02:10:48.720 London would be amongst the leading
02:10:50.370 survivors right I think the survivors
02:10:52.470 would be people like the
02:10:53.370 hunter-gatherers of the Amazon
02:10:54.570 rainforest because they're in the
02:10:55.590 business of surviving that's what they
02:10:58.230 do it's not a mystery to them it's not
02:11:00.120 even a problem they do it they do it all
02:11:01.860 the time they would they would carry the
02:11:04.260 human story forward and ten thousand
02:11:06.840 years from now
02:11:07.860 their descendants would be telling a
02:11:09.570 myth about how there was once a great
02:11:11.880 civilization on this planet so advanced
02:11:14.369 that they could even go to the moon they
02:11:17.369 could fly around the planet they could
02:11:19.260 speak to one another on other sides of
02:11:21.179 the earth but they did something wrong
02:11:23.699 they fell out of harmony with the
02:11:25.980 universe they ceased to wear their
02:11:27.690 prosperity with moderation that's
02:11:29.460 actually a line from Plato about
02:11:30.929 Atlantis Wow and the universe slapped
02:11:33.510 them down so there would be a
02:11:36.480 differential survival rate those who
02:11:38.489 were that I would say that those who are
02:11:39.960 more technologically advanced are less
02:11:41.909 likely to survive because they depend on
02:11:43.800 a complex interrelated network of skills
02:11:46.590 and any individual on his or her own
02:11:49.619 most of them well you're different
02:11:51.270 jokers you do know how to survive but a
02:11:52.889 lot of people don't know how to barely
02:11:54.869 know how to survive most likely so
02:11:57.600 you've worked at it yeah I'm not that
02:11:59.429 good at it but most of us most of us
02:12:01.409 haven't even worked at it at all we
02:12:02.699 haven't got a clue let me [ __ ] open
02:12:04.230 everybody's eyes to all these people to
02:12:05.580 think that you could just go out there
02:12:06.900 and shoot annals and stay alive good
02:12:08.790 [ __ ] luck you're you're probably
02:12:11.550 screwed if you have a rifle even if you
02:12:13.830 have a rifle you're probably screwed if
02:12:15.300 you have a bow and arrow you're gonna
02:12:16.260 [ __ ] starve to death
02:12:17.340 right it's extremely difficult yes to
02:12:20.639 get close you know and yet
02:12:22.530 hunter-gatherers for thousands and
02:12:24.210 thousands of years have succeeded in
02:12:25.770 doing that like that the Bushmen of the
02:12:27.570 Kalahari I think there was less humans
02:12:30.090 and more animals right I think that's
02:12:32.159 also part of the rub okay it's like
02:12:34.139 we're dealing with is that one of the
02:12:35.760 terrible things we've done is taking
02:12:37.710 these giant swaths of land and made them
02:12:40.350 entirely inhabitable for wildlife like
02:12:42.600 cities like you how many people grow
02:12:45.360 food in the city that what is the
02:12:46.739 percentage is it even 1/10 of 1% of
02:12:48.719 people in the city grow their own food
02:12:49.889 probably no probably not even that so
02:12:51.750 you have these massive essentially
02:12:53.850 deserts with where no wildlife exists
02:12:56.400 other than predatory species like
02:12:58.350 coyotes and ravens and things like that
02:13:00.239 and take and then you you you go out
02:13:02.880 from there and then you have these vast
02:13:04.560 farmlands yeah the only benefit of the
02:13:06.869 vast farmlands is the amount of deer
02:13:08.699 that exist now is greatly more than when
02:13:11.190 Columbus landed but it's because they've
02:13:13.409 almost become an agricultural animal
02:13:16.080 it's almost like they're almost a
02:13:17.489 domesticated animal they're a free wild
02:13:19.940 domesticated animal
02:13:21.420 I have a friend who has a farm in Iowa
02:13:23.340 and when you go there it's very strange
02:13:25.500 because he's got these wild giant
02:13:28.640 300-pound forest horses running around
02:13:31.770 his backyard I mean they're [ __ ]
02:13:33.780 everywhere there's all these giant deer
02:13:35.790 and when we were there it's what's
02:13:36.960 called the rut so all these they're very
02:13:38.880 horny so the big bucks are usually high
02:13:41.340 they show themselves I'm like this is a
02:13:43.530 crazy place like there's all these wild
02:13:46.050 animals that exist along with people and
02:13:48.510 even in a game rich place like that
02:13:50.969 it's incredibly difficult to get to one
02:13:53.070 you have to have vegetables you'd have
02:13:55.020 to have your own vegetables so let's
02:13:56.820 imagine the situation where all the
02:13:58.380 resources of our cities all the yeah all
02:14:00.480 the amenities all the infrastructure are
02:14:02.370 gone most of us are [ __ ] I would say
02:14:04.739 radically ours I would say in fact our
02:14:07.290 civilization which appears so strong is
02:14:09.330 actually very very fragile extremely
02:14:12.030 just a little push it's like when you
02:14:13.800 look out the window and you're like wow
02:14:15.810 that's the outside no that's a piece of
02:14:17.699 glass you're outside it's not that piece
02:14:20.580 of glass in your outside you know the
02:14:22.500 effortless it is it just seems in petrol
02:14:25.440 because you know you pull the shades
02:14:26.850 tight and you set your alarm clock in
02:14:29.070 asleep you're sleeping next to glass yes
02:14:31.469 like it's hilarious you feel confident
02:14:34.380 yet you're sleeping next to a piece of
02:14:35.699 [ __ ] glass there's this incredible
02:14:37.500 complacency and arrogance yeah of modern
02:14:40.260 civilization that we are the apex and
02:14:42.210 pinnacle of the human story that we're
02:14:43.890 the best that's ever come and and and
02:14:45.900 that's a danger mythologically that is a
02:14:48.780 very dangerous place to be when you
02:14:51.300 start imagining yourself as the apex and
02:14:54.090 the pinnacle of everything that's
02:14:55.080 precisely when the universe reminds you
02:14:56.790 that you are not that at all yeah it's a
02:14:59.610 very weird existence that we have well
02:15:02.100 we just sort of look at how things are
02:15:04.770 right now and we can't imagine things
02:15:07.620 being any different no matter what
02:15:09.480 whether it's people that have to come to
02:15:11.600 the realization that they've been
02:15:13.800 injured like if someone breaks their leg
02:15:15.239 and also it just doesn't compute like
02:15:16.980 how come I can't walk anymore well your
02:15:18.989 reality is now shifted and this reality
02:15:21.600 that we have here with this fairly
02:15:23.580 healthy earth could shift at any moment
02:15:26.130 that the the Yellowstone Volcano is the
02:15:28.590 one that's been freaking me out the most
02:15:29.850 over the last few years another big
02:15:32.250 issue yeah an interesting pair
02:15:35.100 would be if we look at small or what
02:15:37.740 happens in smaller catastrophes like
02:15:39.900 we've seen today when we look at the ad
02:15:42.560 for example when Katrina hit and hit New
02:15:45.480 Orleans right it was almost as if the
02:15:48.540 human species separated into two sub
02:15:50.730 species you had one group of people that
02:15:53.490 rose to the occasion and did heroic
02:15:56.820 things they organized and they saved
02:15:58.950 people spontaneously you know because
02:16:00.930 the government was conspicuously absent
02:16:03.180 for five days the first five days of the
02:16:06.030 Katrina disaster and here you had a
02:16:07.800 major flooding of New Orleans and and
02:16:11.040 you had people spontaneously organizing
02:16:14.040 and performing these heroic actions of
02:16:16.620 saving their fellow man and and doing
02:16:19.110 just stupendous things super hero type
02:16:21.960 things but then you had another segment
02:16:24.240 to the population it just went
02:16:25.980 completely barbaric and you had mass
02:16:28.110 rapes and you know smashing of
02:16:30.800 businesses and looting and in and just
02:16:34.020 people running in it wild complete
02:16:36.559 unrestrained gangs just and just
02:16:39.570 committing violent acts at random so in
02:16:43.799 America the richest country on earth did
02:16:45.870 not manage that crisis well no I mean it
02:16:47.820 was very and that was a little crisis by
02:16:50.250 comparison with what we're talking
02:16:51.360 member when Kanye West go on TV George
02:16:53.429 Bush does not like black people I don't
02:16:56.010 remember that but yeah George Bush I
02:16:58.080 think was on day for George Bush flew
02:17:00.510 over an Air Force One and know the
02:17:02.670 window wave yeah yeah give me below but
02:17:05.730 there's there's a lesson lessons in
02:17:07.650 those kinds of events sure we're not
02:17:09.780 prepared and we have to extrapolate from
02:17:11.910 that and and you know if you go back and
02:17:14.429 what you know I often time as a thought
02:17:16.230 exercise think how how would we respond
02:17:18.660 if we knew that there was a high
02:17:20.910 probability of a younger dryest type
02:17:23.879 event or series of events impending in
02:17:26.490 our future what would you do to start
02:17:28.080 drinking there
02:17:28.790 well you know it all depends on lead
02:17:31.290 time right it all fits on lead towards a
02:17:33.599 10-day lead time like you know the shoot
02:17:35.638 a rocket up there and man I really super
02:17:38.400 again and let's just go hard go hard to
02:17:40.950 the end yeah ten days but ten years or
02:17:43.920 twenty moons then we can do some stuff
02:17:45.900 then we can do some stuff the real scary
02:17:47.490 thing is
02:17:48.540 to scary things one if you survived
02:17:51.510 because you're like [ __ ] you know if you
02:17:54.120 if you really did survive and everybody
02:17:55.830 else was jacked and also in you're
02:17:57.090 dealing with some Mad Max type reality
02:17:59.129 where people are starving to death and
02:18:00.990 they're very desperate and they become
02:18:02.398 almost like animals that's entirely
02:18:05.129 inside the realm of possibility well
02:18:07.109 that's what we learned from Katrina or
02:18:08.549 the other terrifying possibility is that
02:18:11.099 you leave the future of civilization up
02:18:14.068 to those other people is that they
02:18:17.189 survive and they have kids and their
02:18:19.349 kids survive and somehow another
02:18:20.728 somewhere along the line we get better
02:18:22.620 and better at understanding our place
02:18:24.000 here which is what I think has happened
02:18:25.049 yeah and all it would take is one I mean
02:18:28.049 this is as much as people are
02:18:29.760 complaining right now as much as there's
02:18:31.709 riots in the streets because it excuse
02:18:33.599 me
02:18:33.990 protests in the street some riots
02:18:35.879 apparently but over the president-elect
02:18:38.849 what this time is it represents the
02:18:41.189 greatest time in history when it comes
02:18:42.808 to safety when it comes to knowledge
02:18:44.459 access to information the way we
02:18:46.349 understand each other I don't think it's
02:18:47.670 ever been better as far as long as we
02:18:49.978 know we have everything at our feet yeah
02:18:53.010 there's there's incredible potential in
02:18:55.910 modern civilization the but the problem
02:18:59.068 is that there's also very rigid mind
02:19:01.769 control the way that our societies work
02:19:03.779 is it's turning people into drones
02:19:05.599 people people brought up to believe that
02:19:08.099 their only purpose in existence is
02:19:09.629 production and consumption the people
02:19:12.540 forced to fit into a sort of narrow
02:19:14.790 place in the Machine mass media beaming
02:19:17.218 you know messages at us at us all the
02:19:19.500 time even the concept of democracy is
02:19:21.870 absurd when you don't when you don't
02:19:23.490 have complete transparency when there
02:19:25.228 are secrets when things are hidden how
02:19:26.549 can the people vote you know with Alia
02:19:28.888 with clear minded if a lot is being
02:19:31.049 hidden from them that's not democracy
02:19:33.170 democracies in fact invest in in mind
02:19:35.818 control most unfortunate development
02:19:37.879 well I I wonder how long it's going to
02:19:41.580 take before the rigid mindsets that are
02:19:44.818 in place right now on this idea of this
02:19:47.308 resistance to change that we were
02:19:48.990 talking about when it comes to science
02:19:51.120 when it comes to the accepting this
02:19:54.109 asteroid will impact theory and I think
02:19:56.640 that exists in politics I think it
02:19:58.260 exists in religion I think it exists
02:20:00.090 socially the way we approach
02:20:01.439 relationship
02:20:02.189 and friendships and just all of it is
02:20:04.949 evolving in front of our eyes I was
02:20:06.959 watching a movie last night not another
02:20:09.840 teenage movie I said what it is that was
02:20:12.090 called and I was live-tweeting it so
02:20:13.829 smoking pot and writing and sometimes I
02:20:16.350 just like to have the TV on and not
02:20:17.670 listen to it just just sometimes I like
02:20:19.709 to like see some things when just
02:20:21.209 writing things sometimes I know that
02:20:23.220 last night I chose to do it that way and
02:20:25.140 I just got so enamored in this weird
02:20:27.390 movie from 2001 this is a the movie felt
02:20:31.439 like a time machine as like I was
02:20:33.680 watching this culture that does not
02:20:36.749 exist anymore it's one of those like
02:20:40.430 teenager movies where like in college
02:20:43.020 and they're drinking there's a lot of
02:20:44.729 naked women and really racist sexist
02:20:47.640 humor and its really crude and Goofy and
02:20:50.550 stupid and I'm like this is so bizarre
02:20:53.069 because they this doesn't exist anymore
02:20:54.869 this kind of film like this is like this
02:20:57.479 is like Al Jolson with blackface on or
02:20:59.430 something and in a way it's like a
02:21:01.319 cultural time machine like you get to go
02:21:03.840 and for a brief moment see like this
02:21:06.630 comedy that somebody concocted in 2001
02:21:08.850 which seemed so recent but it's such a
02:21:11.609 in that film you get evidence of this
02:21:15.239 weird cultural change our students a
02:21:17.130 weird massive cultural change that's
02:21:19.829 happened as far as we're we're allowed
02:21:21.659 to joke around about things I'm just
02:21:23.010 embrace it [ __ ] in that movie
02:21:25.020 like racist and sexist [ __ ] and violence
02:21:28.050 like men punching women in the face and
02:21:29.670 [ __ ] like that you just can't really do
02:21:31.380 in a comedy to that mm-hm and that's
02:21:33.149 only 15 years ago
02:21:34.140 and what what is it going to be like if
02:21:36.359 we can avoid getting hit by a rock
02:21:38.760 blowing ourselves up Yellowstone blowing
02:21:40.979 up in our face if we can keep going I
02:21:43.170 think we're on a great path I think our
02:21:45.149 lesson where I'll think about the
02:21:46.350 president-elect and I think we're on a
02:21:48.390 great path it's a hazardous past it path
02:21:51.060 it so it's a path where the future is
02:21:53.279 not at all certain but but Humanity is
02:21:56.189 at one of those moments mother's
02:21:59.399 crossroads where you kind of stand on
02:22:01.229 the edge of an abyss and and you don't
02:22:02.970 quite know what lies ahead and we can
02:22:04.920 take a really great path out of this or
02:22:07.739 we can take a really horrible path right
02:22:10.200 and I I think the key issue is that we
02:22:13.110 do actually have choice it doesn't have
02:22:14.820 to be that way I see a lot of positive a
02:22:16.680 lot that's positive out there out there
02:22:19.200 in the world I do think people are
02:22:20.850 waking up I think they are questioning
02:22:22.650 old structures they're refusing to put
02:22:24.750 up with the [ __ ] any longer more and
02:22:27.090 more people are doing that is happening
02:22:28.350 in the realm of politics is happening in
02:22:29.939 the realm dealing with the big
02:22:31.020 corporations it's happening in the realm
02:22:32.580 of investigating the past we're just not
02:22:35.100 going to be told what to think anymore
02:22:36.870 that's encouraging but then on the other
02:22:38.880 side there are huge efforts being put
02:22:41.130 precisely into making people think in
02:22:43.110 certain ways whether it's the
02:22:44.370 advertising industry whether it's
02:22:45.570 political messages and so we have to be
02:22:47.790 aware of that and it could go it could
02:22:49.890 go down the drone path I mean like the
02:22:51.960 bee The Beehive path which would be a
02:22:53.910 wipe even bothered to be human if your
02:22:56.189 society is turning you into a work at
02:22:58.290 drone in a bee hive life existence or it
02:23:01.530 could go down an expansion of
02:23:03.570 consciousness and a realization of the
02:23:05.939 incredible beautiful potential of the
02:23:08.040 human race I honestly feel like that's
02:23:10.170 where it's going I do John sleet I'm
02:23:11.939 optimistic I'm very up to missile that's
02:23:13.680 beautiful to hear because this is a time
02:23:15.990 I was watching that John Oliver show
02:23:17.820 it's a great show on HBO very funny guy
02:23:20.130 and his very left-wing leaning and as is
02:23:23.880 his show but they had this [ __ ] 2016
02:23:26.550 thing where they were just naming off
02:23:27.990 all the horrible things that happen in
02:23:29.580 2016 though and then just saying goodbye
02:23:31.979 to this terrible year I'm like yeah but
02:23:34.650 a lot of good [ __ ] happened this year
02:23:36.060 too there's a lot of fantastic
02:23:38.100 discoveries a lot of interesting
02:23:39.720 observations a lot of people learned a
02:23:41.670 lot of things in 2016 as well and I
02:23:44.850 think that I'm quite a number of
02:23:46.590 American states have made cannabis legal
02:23:48.420 yes that's I think you know there's a
02:23:50.189 huge development it's it's also a big
02:23:52.380 it's going to be a big factor in our
02:23:54.420 cultural evolution it really well well
02:23:56.460 it was a big factor in the 60s it was a
02:23:58.950 huge factor in an in effect what
02:24:01.380 happened you had a very closed
02:24:03.660 conservative society and then you had an
02:24:05.790 outside shock in the form of the
02:24:07.860 psychedelic drugs that came in and
02:24:09.960 completely stirred up everything in art
02:24:12.720 and music and fashion and even into
02:24:14.760 scientific concepts of our place in the
02:24:18.000 universe and time and space and in in so
02:24:21.240 many ways that had just a
02:24:23.789 major impact on the direction in our
02:24:25.739 society when and what would be the
02:24:28.589 equivalent today or in our near future
02:24:31.169 in terms of an outside shock that would
02:24:34.399 suddenly wake people up would be another
02:24:38.219 event another Tunguska event and based
02:24:41.669 upon everything that I've seen it would
02:24:44.399 suggest that events like that are going
02:24:47.129 to happen and probably within our
02:24:48.779 lifetime and when it does happen
02:24:50.989 especially if the message of the story
02:24:53.609 has been out and enough people have
02:24:55.829 heard it five percent of the people or
02:24:57.599 ten percent of the people are aware that
02:24:59.399 there is this major impending potential
02:25:03.299 paradigm shift and then we have an event
02:25:05.759 like that an event like Tunguska 1908 I
02:25:08.909 think that's all it would take because
02:25:10.619 the the magnitude of that event would
02:25:13.289 have been such that it occurred today
02:25:14.939 and you had anywhere from a million to
02:25:18.329 two million people instantly wiped out
02:25:21.179 or a whole city instantly annihilated
02:25:24.359 from a thing from a shot from space what
02:25:27.389 effect would that have on the planetary
02:25:30.419 consciousness in which with this latest
02:25:32.189 exercise NASA coming late to the party
02:25:34.259 finally seems to be thinking about you
02:25:36.449 know that what happened they finally see
02:25:38.099 what happened if LA is hit by you know a
02:25:39.989 350 foot diameter right in epidemic ulna
02:25:42.719 is because well when that when the the
02:25:44.819 probability models for a Tunguska type
02:25:46.919 event were first laid out in the 50s and
02:25:49.889 60s and into the 70s it was pretty much
02:25:51.839 determined that it was like something
02:25:53.879 that would happen once a millennium once
02:25:55.829 every couple of millenniums then it sort
02:25:57.779 of got contracted to once every few
02:25:59.279 centuries you know it may be that it's
02:26:02.099 actually much more like one or two a
02:26:04.079 century or maybe even perhaps clustered
02:26:07.559 events where you may have three or four
02:26:09.839 or half a dozen of those type events
02:26:11.999 occurring over a very short window of
02:26:14.159 time but an event like that happening
02:26:16.889 not one that would be caused the
02:26:18.809 extinction of civilization by any means
02:26:20.789 but an event like that that could you
02:26:23.429 know wipe out a thousand square miles of
02:26:26.159 landscape completely in an instant would
02:26:29.699 have a major effect I think on the
02:26:32.699 people of this planet it would focus
02:26:34.529 Minds it would focus minds in a way that
02:26:36.899 nothing else
02:26:37.530 would and I it's not to me is it
02:26:39.990 pessimistic to say that might be what
02:26:42.450 it's going to take or is it just
02:26:43.830 realistic I don't know well I think it's
02:26:46.800 like the the massive impact versus the
02:26:49.290 slow trickle effect I mean is it going
02:26:51.210 to happen eventually or is it going to
02:26:52.950 happen in one gigantic swoop because of
02:26:55.170 an event like a asteroid Olymp act where
02:26:57.330 it kills a bunch of people and we wake
02:26:58.860 up to the fragility of our existence but
02:27:01.230 either way it's a waking up of humanity
02:27:03.690 and that is in process that is happening
02:27:05.311 that is in process now look as a as a
02:27:08.040 Brit observing what's been happening in
02:27:10.380 America as an outsider I'm enormous ly
02:27:12.420 encouraged by the legalization of
02:27:14.340 cannabis movement that is that is taking
02:27:16.561 place here and and and what it and what
02:27:18.660 it all means sure I like to smoke a
02:27:20.730 joint but this is not about getting high
02:27:22.440 it's not about recreation what this is
02:27:24.090 about is recognizing the sovereignty of
02:27:26.311 adults to make decisions over their own
02:27:28.920 bodies their own health and their own
02:27:31.471 consciousness while doing no harm to
02:27:33.000 others that's what it's about and that's
02:27:34.410 a really [ __ ] important issue that is
02:27:36.990 for me that is the most important issue
02:27:38.820 because if we live in a society that is
02:27:40.530 not prepared to recognize adult
02:27:42.900 sovereignty over one's own body and
02:27:44.580 one's own consciousness then that cannot
02:27:46.500 be a free society in any meaningful way
02:27:48.931 and so I applaud the people of America
02:27:51.330 in those states who have voted for full
02:27:53.221 legalization that's a brilliant thing to
02:27:55.471 do and that's going to have an impact
02:27:56.641 around the world because the war on
02:27:58.410 drugs all the ideology and lies about
02:28:00.931 cannabis are all going to be proved
02:28:02.880 wrong we're going to know that the
02:28:05.040 Emperor wears no clothes that you can
02:28:06.900 legalize cannabis and civilization does
02:28:08.971 not fall apart as the war on drugs Lobby
02:28:11.221 have been telling us for ages it's going
02:28:13.530 to it's going to change everything and
02:28:15.210 it's a beautiful thing because it's the
02:28:16.650 American people whereas the American
02:28:18.511 State America as a governmental state
02:28:22.050 presence on the world stage has been the
02:28:24.240 dark force behind the war on drugs so
02:28:26.521 it's it's a to me a beautiful thing that
02:28:29.610 is the American people state-by-state
02:28:31.200 who are winding that back and saying we
02:28:33.601 will not put up with this [ __ ] anymore I
02:28:35.550 think what you were talking about
02:28:36.750 earlier is really important to we're
02:28:38.190 talking about different factions of our
02:28:41.431 civilization or creating it to this day
02:28:43.891 they're still creating disinformation
02:28:45.300 and still trying to mislead people but I
02:28:48.931 think that goes to what we're talking
02:28:51.270 before were it's a system and systems
02:28:53.399 protect themselves and I think that they
02:28:56.310 develop almost a consciousness of their
02:28:57.750 own it's scary in a way yeah yeah
02:28:59.520 bureaucracies arm the bureaucracies
02:29:01.500 they've got a kind of personality well
02:29:02.939 even when there's no financial stake in
02:29:04.470 it there's just a social stake like what
02:29:06.960 you're seeing right now with the left
02:29:08.220 versus the right yeah like there's some
02:29:09.899 people like my friend Wanda Sykes just
02:29:12.869 got booed off stage at something last
02:29:14.760 night apparently what she went on some
02:29:16.619 anti-trump rant and then and people got
02:29:18.989 super upset at her there's these systems
02:29:21.510 that are in place this this is this why
02:29:24.510 almost like wanting to fight like it's
02:29:28.199 not it sets us up in this bizarre team
02:29:31.829 mentality where this left protects its
02:29:34.500 ideas of the future and the right
02:29:36.149 protects its ideas and I'm watching
02:29:38.189 these people go at it back and forth on
02:29:39.930 social media and it's toxic and I don't
02:29:42.449 like to use that term because it's so
02:29:44.010 compromised by you know toxic sexuality
02:29:47.460 or toxic masculinity so many uses of
02:29:50.100 that word in our culture but I think
02:29:51.569 that this desire to fight with each
02:29:53.159 other and be deeply unpleasant it's a
02:29:55.380 really horrible hurtful gosling things
02:29:57.539 you see it so often and really I mean
02:29:59.760 vile and from the left too as well as
02:30:01.829 the right the left is toxic toasters the
02:30:03.600 right word
02:30:04.170 exactly and I think that we have to
02:30:07.260 resist the urge to fight I think this is
02:30:10.109 when people push too far on the left
02:30:12.689 that's when the alt-right emerges when
02:30:14.819 people push too far on the right that's
02:30:16.680 when the left comes up and you know
02:30:18.329 that's when you know Kent state
02:30:19.619 emergency you have all these weird
02:30:21.600 factions duking it out that have so much
02:30:23.760 in common yeah and a lot of times the
02:30:26.220 things that they don't have in common
02:30:27.449 it's either because of an ignorance or
02:30:29.640 it's because of an ideological dispute
02:30:31.800 or a lack of communication and I think
02:30:33.479 of those three things are in place at
02:30:35.340 least open lines of communication
02:30:37.319 Lynch is also fostered by marijuana and
02:30:40.319 get these people talking openly and
02:30:43.229 vulnerably about these things and you
02:30:45.029 find out that a lot of our misgivings
02:30:47.609 and our misunderstandings about each
02:30:48.989 other or just misconceptions
02:30:50.659 miscommunications and we probably even
02:30:52.949 if we disagree on things I have friends
02:30:54.689 that I disagree on a lot of stuff with
02:30:57.029 but we're very close yeah
02:30:58.770 because world you're allowed to have
02:31:00.149 different opinions of course that's what
02:31:01.590 makes the world interest doesn't have to
02:31:03.119 be we held at each other because we're
02:31:04.350 weak is weak
02:31:05.080 listen to somebody else's opinion with
02:31:06.400 empathy rather than with hatred or anger
02:31:09.070 we have were too it's too attractive to
02:31:11.860 be on a team make the [ __ ] maison
02:31:14.170 it's very elegant yeah it is man it's
02:31:18.311 it's too attractive it's too attractive
02:31:20.050 and we'd love I mean we love city versus
02:31:22.180 city we love that we love when you know
02:31:24.190 Chicago's gonna take on Cleveland [ __ ]
02:31:26.710 you we love that the tribal is the
02:31:28.900 tribal thing you know we've not really
02:31:31.300 evolved out of that we've changed our
02:31:33.430 social structures but we're still tribal
02:31:35.170 tribal mentality we should nationalism
02:31:37.300 is just tribalism writ large yeah so it
02:31:39.670 really is just like religions just a
02:31:42.250 cult with a lot more people yeah exactly
02:31:44.500 yeah
02:31:45.220 should we look at one more yeah we could
02:31:46.690 look at as many as you want man Oh Rolla
02:31:48.490 party what do you got yeah let's see the
02:31:51.220 next one
02:31:51.760 back to the flood this is the place that
02:31:53.260 I didn't get to take grams that I really
02:31:55.420 wanted okay I really wanted to take you
02:31:57.700 here let's see it lets see it so you're
02:32:00.100 gonna see it
02:32:00.700 second best okay possibly this is the
02:32:03.330 potholes holy [ __ ] look at that this is
02:32:07.840 crazy this what we're looking at folks
02:32:11.050 that people who are just listening in
02:32:13.590 you have to go to the YouTube now cuz
02:32:16.300 this is insanity this is as close a like
02:32:20.140 a knot for a dummy like me to look at
02:32:22.660 something like that and then go [ __ ]
02:32:24.130 you for yeah that's definitely a river a
02:32:26.110 river carve that okay what you're
02:32:29.021 looking at there is a gigantic extinct
02:32:32.470 set of cataracts like you would find it
02:32:35.830 Niagara Falls but to use grams to large
02:32:39.870 we're looking at a ridge we're looking
02:32:42.730 east the tsunami wave that swept down
02:32:45.700 over these four states one branch of it
02:32:48.280 swept off to the west this particular
02:32:50.680 branch of it was 400 feet deep when it
02:32:53.021 hit this Ridge and what it did was it
02:32:55.240 spilled over the ridge and down here in
02:32:57.280 the foreground you see the modern-day
02:32:58.780 Columbia River from the top of the ridge
02:33:01.630 where you see the the agriculture in the
02:33:04.090 landscape down to the rivers about a
02:33:06.010 thousand feet well so you basically have
02:33:09.190 to picture you've got this huge sheet of
02:33:11.561 water three to four hundred feet deep
02:33:14.140 it's rushing over and it finds a low
02:33:16.960 little
02:33:17.890 lowest spot within this Ridge and that's
02:33:20.229 where it starts focusing its energy and
02:33:22.239 as it does it begins to just strip away
02:33:25.000 the rock now what you're looking at here
02:33:27.159 is this cataract complex is about five
02:33:29.290 miles across and the otter came in you
02:33:32.319 see you've got those kind of curved
02:33:33.850 finger lakes at the top and those
02:33:36.189 tunnels those are potholes
02:33:38.680 that's insane potholes are formed by
02:33:40.870 underwater turbulence and in a flood
02:33:43.390 this swiftly-moving with this much
02:33:45.790 turbulence you literally have four
02:33:47.949 ticular Eddie's high intensity high
02:33:50.770 amplitude high energy underwater
02:33:54.130 tornadoes literally underwater tornadoes
02:33:56.470 now these underwater tornadoes are
02:33:58.930 typically in this case about a half a
02:34:00.880 mile walk oh my they're spinning at a
02:34:03.010 high rate of speed and they're right
02:34:04.569 there they're probably 600 feet deep
02:34:06.550 because the water pouring over the ridge
02:34:08.890 is at least 200 and you can see what
02:34:10.930 it's done to the bedrock anybody
02:34:13.180 listening you got a wall you got to look
02:34:14.500 at this you have to look at this and
02:34:15.729 then listen to the scale this is this is
02:34:17.800 a gigantic scar in the landscape of
02:34:20.590 which there are hundreds around this the
02:34:24.370 exact location Rundle this is potholes
02:34:27.489 cataract right the exact location that
02:34:31.109 it was to get to it which were in
02:34:33.520 Washington State still yes we're in
02:34:35.170 Washington say central Washington's can
02:34:36.880 be right on the Columbia River just
02:34:39.699 below Wenatchee okay where we saw that
02:34:42.130 where we saw that huge that huge erratic
02:34:44.590 yes
02:34:45.520 giant 18,000 ton Boulder brought there
02:34:48.159 and chained in an iceberg an iceberg
02:34:51.130 floating on the flood carry an iceberg
02:34:53.199 the size of an oil tanker carrying an
02:34:55.300 18,000 ton Boulder carried on the flood
02:34:58.090 grounds 700 feet up of Raleigh side
02:35:01.090 rests there as the flood waters recede
02:35:03.460 the ice melts away and the boulder is
02:35:05.739 left sitting what we're gonna be sure of
02:35:07.899 that
02:35:08.260 Boulder in a second one of the people
02:35:09.939 back in this part of the country what do
02:35:12.399 they think about this well you know
02:35:14.229 they're only just catching on to what
02:35:16.210 they're sitting on top of he's the first
02:35:18.189 time I went out here 98 there was the
02:35:20.649 the ice age floods Institute and I went
02:35:22.960 to their only location which was a which
02:35:25.840 was in the Better Business Bureau in in
02:35:28.659 Moses Lake Washington and it was they
02:35:30.370 had one room
02:35:31.091 boom in the back of this Better Business
02:35:33.011 Bureau Chamber of Commerce Chamber of
02:35:34.931 Commerce and there was two elderly
02:35:37.091 ladies in there who are basically the
02:35:39.161 the overseers of the group now there's
02:35:41.471 about two dozen chapters and every year
02:35:44.561 there's several guided field trips led
02:35:47.980 by geologists who are studying this in
02:35:50.711 their off time and I've been on a number
02:35:52.091 of these just to participate and get the
02:35:54.461 air the access to the geologists in
02:35:56.621 order to pick their brains but this is
02:35:59.711 this is very close to when a Qi
02:36:01.781 Washington so anybody he's wanting to
02:36:03.581 find this on Google Earth this is a
02:36:05.230 Google Earth image now what we're going
02:36:07.061 to open but before we leave the Google
02:36:08.411 Earth image I was going to explain that
02:36:10.181 you've got those you got those see those
02:36:12.281 lakes those this meandering lakes up mhm
02:36:14.771 what you got a picture is you've got a
02:36:16.121 sheet of water coming and as it's coming
02:36:18.701 over this Ridge it's beginning to
02:36:20.230 selectively erode into fault lines and
02:36:23.980 cracks within the bedrock can you
02:36:25.841 picture that the water is going to
02:36:27.311 naturally try to go into those low spots
02:36:30.041 where there's cracks and fissures and
02:36:31.961 it'll start going from a sheet into
02:36:34.121 channeling mmm what goes from sheet to a
02:36:36.761 channeled in then that spills over the
02:36:38.921 ridge and in the middle you see this
02:36:41.591 it's called a rock blade see that the
02:36:44.141 wrong laid is that debts that yes that's
02:36:47.051 it right there separating the two
02:36:48.610 alcoves if the flood had continued for
02:36:51.671 another few days that rock blade would
02:36:54.251 have been gone and you would have had a
02:36:55.811 single alcove up there now in the next
02:36:59.381 as this proceeds what we're going to do
02:37:01.631 is we're going to go down and we're
02:37:03.341 going to be right at the head of the
02:37:04.690 rock blade right there yeah right there
02:37:07.181 we're standing right there so now you're
02:37:09.701 going to get to see as the drone is
02:37:11.980 about to take off you're seeing the
02:37:14.171 landscape we're looking to the east in
02:37:16.061 the direction of those Finger Lakes and
02:37:19.211 I guess the soundtrack is it not playing
02:37:22.511 the sound not oh there we go in here a
02:37:25.331 little Toccata and Fugue in d-minor oh
02:37:29.071 okay and the landscape opens up so
02:37:31.781 you're on that rock blade we're on the
02:37:33.821 rock blade right there that's so now you
02:37:35.531 can begin to see the scale of this thing
02:37:37.811 that we were just seeing from Google
02:37:39.551 Earth well now the way when you describe
02:37:41.921 it I mean
02:37:43.311 I would have just looked at it and go
02:37:44.990 wow that's kind of cool-looking I would
02:37:46.791 never have thought so that was obviously
02:37:49.041 created by water pouring through that's
02:37:51.320 the problem is because we haven't had
02:37:53.541 the scale of perception it took Brett's
02:37:56.501 25 years to put the pieces together well
02:37:59.631 also we haven't been able to take these
02:38:01.700 sort of high-resolution photographs
02:38:04.251 cause they're wrong he's right above it
02:38:05.751 till recently yeah that's that's it
02:38:07.700 gives us a whole other insight I mean
02:38:09.381 you used to be $1,000 an hour to get up
02:38:11.181 there in a helicopter now you can fly a
02:38:12.591 drone around you know it would have
02:38:13.971 known yeah exactly GoPro on it right
02:38:16.671 here in the middle ground you see that
02:38:18.080 big hole that's about 200 feet in
02:38:19.820 diameter that's that's a pothole that
02:38:22.521 was created by this swirling vortex of
02:38:25.931 massively turbulent water holy [ __ ] this
02:38:29.330 is incredible yeah in otherwise the
02:38:30.980 evidence is all over the landscape oh
02:38:32.811 staring us in the eyes and it's only in
02:38:34.910 the recent years that it started to make
02:38:36.381 sense we've evolved the the eyes to be
02:38:40.730 able to see this and so now by going out
02:38:43.011 here with a draw I've been over this
02:38:44.301 landscape several times in a small plane
02:38:46.641 to see it from that perspective but now
02:38:49.251 like he just said like Graham just said
02:38:51.921 now we've got a drone it can go up and
02:38:53.780 see it from a whole different
02:38:54.711 perspective and and now you can see see
02:38:57.771 they see the man standing right down
02:38:59.660 there on the rock no you see all that
02:39:02.030 little dude yeah yeah little that little
02:39:05.990 dude is 6 feet tall he's not that
02:39:07.671 liveable I mean on the pictures little
02:39:09.891 no no in July we are 4 inches it's it's
02:39:15.080 it's an illusion what's the me stunning
02:39:17.990 that we knew this is really beautiful
02:39:19.490 and cool and everything like that but
02:39:20.721 what's really stunning is the initial
02:39:22.251 picture where it becomes so obvious that
02:39:24.711 above picture we see the farmland and
02:39:26.780 that just it's so obviously cut cut
02:39:29.381 sliced out of the lens let's see the
02:39:31.400 rest of it then as the drone flies over
02:39:34.671 yeah so and then we have what's called
02:39:37.301 classic scab land you see all these
02:39:39.650 mounds these kind of lumps that's what
02:39:42.261 are the scabs on the scab land that's
02:39:44.601 why it's called scab land and again it's
02:39:46.311 flooding that causes it plucking slifer
02:39:48.410 entually plucking material off the
02:39:50.271 surface mmm wow this is incredible and
02:39:53.990 in this water remaining
02:39:55.341 yeah then fill fill the pie
02:39:57.261 yeah God yeah there you get a saw Mike
02:39:59.900 there you get a sense of the rock blade
02:40:02.200 well there you get a sense of what the
02:40:04.190 volume of water muscle looked like when
02:40:06.171 it was rushing through there right and
02:40:07.881 see this is just holy [ __ ] we've looked
02:40:10.400 at two features now Camas Prairie and
02:40:12.200 potholes cataract we could sit here for
02:40:15.711 the next 10 hours looking at dozens and
02:40:18.051 dozens of these mega features and you
02:40:20.900 look at there's a whole bar this is a
02:40:23.211 gravel bar down here over there okay see
02:40:26.690 see the giant ribs on it you see those
02:40:29.120 yeah I've never seen those reported in
02:40:31.730 the literature it may be that nobody's
02:40:33.351 ever seek really seen him before or no
02:40:35.870 one's ever paid attention
02:40:36.891 nobody's ever paid a tip but there they
02:40:38.271 are so how what is mainstream science
02:40:40.730 use to describe this this sort of or
02:40:42.921 mainstream archaeology used to describe
02:40:45.080 these features this would be geology
02:40:46.730 well Karis an archeology yeah what would
02:40:50.330 they so they believe this catastrophic
02:40:51.740 flooding is I just think it's a slower
02:40:53.900 I think it's lots of small catastrophic
02:40:55.910 floods they're not not one not one big
02:40:57.860 catastrophic flood and how what kind of
02:40:59.780 timeline are these geologists putting on
02:41:01.820 us Oh two or three thousand years yeah
02:41:03.980 and why do they think that well because
02:41:06.171 of the the ice dammed model and how much
02:41:09.261 time it would take see it gets
02:41:11.601 complicated and because until the comet
02:41:14.601 research there was no credible source of
02:41:17.141 heat that could melt that amount of ice
02:41:19.610 and cause out now that's the new factor
02:41:21.591 that's come into the equation now you
02:41:23.511 look at look at the people standing on
02:41:25.280 the cliff edge they're the edge of the
02:41:26.870 rock would you see them down there
02:41:28.311 yeah so now you get the sense of scale
02:41:30.860 what would survive again in the
02:41:33.110 aftermath not that dude something no not
02:41:35.150 that dude not a dude or his buddies yeah
02:41:40.011 this is a crazy place man it's crazy to
02:41:42.771 look at it's just so when you were
02:41:45.830 looking above it I gave in here I mean
02:41:47.990 you get a sense of it but if you would
02:41:49.881 just show this to me quite honestly I
02:41:51.561 probably wouldn't piece that together
02:41:54.011 but when you look at it the original
02:41:56.211 image it's so blatantly obvious right
02:41:58.610 well that's that's the thing now is we
02:42:00.261 are in this position where we can we can
02:42:02.391 see it and when I take people out in the
02:42:04.400 field what I do is I I prep them first
02:42:07.461 by showing these images from NASA
02:42:10.670 the satellite photography the Google
02:42:12.859 Earth imagery aerial photography then
02:42:15.859 ground photography and then you go out
02:42:18.439 in the landscape and at that point you
02:42:20.239 can start having this framework for
02:42:21.830 understanding what you're seeing
02:42:22.909 otherwise you just don't the scale of it
02:42:25.580 is too vast it's amazing it's really
02:42:28.340 amazing this is you know this is an
02:42:31.670 adventure of exploration that we're just
02:42:34.489 getting launched on this is this is
02:42:36.080 recovering yes recovering the lost the
02:42:38.689 lost past of humanity and if I may I
02:42:41.840 want to make a pitch again for the
02:42:43.370 Comets for the comet research group if
02:42:45.560 anybody I think it's really important
02:42:47.630 it's not it's it's not just a matter of
02:42:49.790 funding their research it's also a
02:42:51.500 matter of sending a message that we the
02:42:53.930 people are prepared to take matters into
02:42:56.149 our own hands and and support those
02:42:59.120 scientists who are working with open
02:43:01.010 minds inquiring into the past and
02:43:03.409 whether you know give a dollar or a
02:43:05.689 hundred dollars or whatever any little
02:43:07.670 counts it says it's the voice of the
02:43:09.890 people as much as the money that really
02:43:12.290 that really matters these guys the comet
02:43:14.149 research group they need their research
02:43:15.649 funding they have an indiegogo
02:43:16.939 crowdfunding campaign you can go to my
02:43:19.460 website press the comet research group
02:43:21.890 banner it will take you to a page with
02:43:23.479 all the relevant links please consider
02:43:25.970 supporting it it's valid it's worthwhile
02:43:27.920 it's worthy work and it has the
02:43:29.659 potential to change the whole story of
02:43:32.479 our past and our future and it's a story
02:43:34.699 that would be incredibly exciting to be
02:43:37.310 a part of and that's what I'm trying to
02:43:39.800 get people to think look there's this
02:43:41.510 thing happening and it really it is
02:43:43.550 Democratic in its own way and you don't
02:43:45.890 have to be some specialist or a thora
02:43:48.290 particularly in some branch of
02:43:51.370 academically approved science to begin
02:43:53.510 to appreciate and understand this very
02:43:56.300 human being getting out into the field
02:43:58.189 and seeing this kind of stuff firsthand
02:44:00.220 getting it into the discussion into
02:44:02.390 debate and in spending more time on this
02:44:04.699 because it's it's such an interesting
02:44:06.859 story and that's where the scientists at
02:44:09.050 the comet research group are offering
02:44:10.460 that the people who contribute will
02:44:12.319 participate in certain ways and this
02:44:14.000 also in the future but we're all wells
02:44:16.040 gays we're all human beings we're a part
02:44:17.779 of this planet we are pedestrians
02:44:19.670 walking along at the unlit we're being
02:44:23.220 married by this planet and all this
02:44:25.529 stuff is alright it's it's your right to
02:44:27.270 understand what the history of this
02:44:29.310 crazy Rock has gone through absolutely
02:44:32.250 this is amazing yes an amazing stuff
02:44:34.080 into perspective to understand this is
02:44:36.060 like this for 12,000 years this story
02:44:39.239 has been written into the landscape of
02:44:41.609 the earth and only now are we able to
02:44:45.239 step back and begin to see the big
02:44:47.430 picture in in tandem with ever greater
02:44:51.239 detail and what's emerging is really
02:44:54.470 it's a really wild tale but the evidence
02:44:57.810 is there to support it completely and
02:45:00.359 this is I mean this is this is what is
02:45:02.550 is the story I've told and magician's of
02:45:04.260 the guns this is this is recovering this
02:45:06.239 this lost memory it really is wild and
02:45:08.700 our time here on this planet has been
02:45:11.359 confusing for so many reasons and the
02:45:15.029 one of the big ones is not not
02:45:17.130 understanding how we got here and that's
02:45:18.450 one of the reasons why your book I think
02:45:20.189 is so important to me
02:45:21.390 just give you this new perspective of
02:45:23.520 how this sort of civilization emerged
02:45:25.080 another problem when I think we deal
02:45:26.970 with all the time is light pollution
02:45:29.250 I think light pollution ever see the
02:45:30.960 stone it's I think it's a really a
02:45:32.880 perspective blocker in a big way no
02:45:35.880 absolute absolutely is the brand old and
02:45:38.010 I were having a discussion earlier about
02:45:39.270 how ancient cultures related to the
02:45:41.370 cosmos as above so below they felt their
02:45:44.430 selves connected with the cosmos they
02:45:46.170 made their monuments in alignment with
02:45:47.970 key celestial bodies they did it very
02:45:50.489 carefully there was a sense of bringing
02:45:52.620 down the enchantment of the heavens onto
02:45:55.229 onto earth in modern societies we can't
02:45:58.350 even see the stars he live in the middle
02:45:59.790 of the big city the stars are gone the
02:46:02.100 light the light pollution just blots
02:46:03.569 them out you never think they're there
02:46:05.100 and you forget actually that you're part
02:46:06.870 of a majestic cosmos everything about it
02:46:10.319 is mystery we are immersed in mystery
02:46:12.720 from the moment we're born to the moment
02:46:14.220 we die and yet our society is telling us
02:46:16.319 so it's all very prosaic and dull and
02:46:18.029 it's just about production everything's
02:46:19.529 all explained you don't really need to
02:46:21.330 worry yourself about it too much because
02:46:23.160 some authority somewhere has it all
02:46:24.840 figured out no one has it all figured
02:46:26.550 out it's not possible I think everybody
02:46:28.470 owes it to themselves to go out into the
02:46:30.569 desert in the middle
02:46:32.130 when when you know there's a stretch
02:46:33.869 where the moon is not going to be out
02:46:35.010 and there's going to be clear skies
02:46:36.840 especially if you live in Southern
02:46:38.399 California you can get out to the desert
02:46:39.689 pretty easy just get out away from all
02:46:41.550 the cities and just look up and it'll
02:46:43.229 freak you out it'll freak you out
02:46:44.640 because it's it's one of those things
02:46:46.140 that you kind of really take for granted
02:46:47.850 because I'm also time the sky is just a
02:46:49.949 dark black featureless thing the little
02:46:53.460 couple little white dots aren't really
02:46:55.229 that compelling but when you get out
02:46:56.790 there and you see the actual Milky Way
02:46:58.109 itself you go oh holy [ __ ] well see now
02:47:01.710 we could have you know every year
02:47:03.630 there's probably a dozen high-altitude
02:47:05.790 events that could have been witnessed by
02:47:08.550 ancient peoples that we are completely
02:47:10.290 oblivious to because of our urban
02:47:12.479 existence because of light pollution
02:47:13.790 because nobody is really looking at the
02:47:15.930 sky but these high-altitude events would
02:47:18.300 be essentially equivalent to like
02:47:20.029 Hiroshima sized bombs going off 20 miles
02:47:24.000 up is just outside yeah it's basically
02:47:26.819 like if it's in the daytime and you're
02:47:28.560 not looking right up there that's right
02:47:30.210 you're not going to see at a time and at
02:47:31.979 night if you're living in the city if
02:47:33.989 you're inside the light pollution by the
02:47:36.359 time it happens it's over but if you're
02:47:38.850 out in a completely wilderness area
02:47:41.609 where you've got but you know visual
02:47:44.310 access to the stars and you're aware of
02:47:46.949 that and you're constantly aware of the
02:47:49.140 presence of the sky you're going to see
02:47:51.060 much more of that kind of thing
02:47:52.470 happening then if the cosmos decides to
02:47:55.859 get a little bit more active which it
02:47:57.899 apparently does from time to time
02:47:59.399 suddenly the sky is now becomes a major
02:48:03.510 factor in your in your existence your
02:48:06.359 tribal existence your cultural existence
02:48:08.899 especially if in those episodes you have
02:48:12.210 multiple fireball type events that could
02:48:15.420 be on the scale of anywhere from
02:48:16.890 Chelyabinsk up to tangu sky and that's
02:48:19.380 what Clube and navier--
02:48:21.119 that's their scenario is these clusters
02:48:23.729 of that we enter episodes of bombardment
02:48:27.350 when we are passing through a filament
02:48:29.699 of the torrid media stream that's thick
02:48:31.500 with heavy debris asteroids of a
02:48:33.689 kilometer or more in diameter when we
02:48:36.420 enter those filaments we're entering a
02:48:38.430 period of episodic bombardment when
02:48:40.229 human civilization is at risk and
02:48:42.540 according to their calculations we are
02:48:44.250 entering one of those
02:48:45.210 in the next 30 years Jesus and that's
02:48:48.330 why we need to pay attention to this
02:48:50.189 because 30 years is enough time to do
02:48:52.229 something about it if we apply the
02:48:53.670 resources of our civilization to this we
02:48:55.500 can solve this problem let's look at a
02:48:59.340 couple more pictures because I'd like to
02:49:01.830 get the picture of Grahame I wonder
02:49:03.060 people are too busy making new phones
02:49:04.649 they don't have time to fix the asteroid
02:49:06.330 thing exactly execs images and Holograms
02:49:10.050 that's my my contention that it's going
02:49:12.840 to take well but again those ago the
02:49:15.720 serious commercial talk of mining
02:49:17.399 asteroids than is that is the way into
02:49:19.529 this that if they can if they can if
02:49:21.060 they can see an economic return for the
02:49:22.739 minute then maybe they'll do the good
02:49:24.060 thing actually for the human race will
02:49:25.319 this have to be a manned expedition like
02:49:27.060 Bruce Willis and then asteroid movie not
02:49:28.890 necessary ok what's the image that won't
02:49:30.989 show well uh Jamie why don't you go to
02:49:33.630 the the folder of the one we opened a
02:49:36.330 folder of Awesomeness the folder for a
02:49:38.790 folder the folder of Awesomeness yeah
02:49:41.910 just let's start with one zero zero
02:49:44.310 seven what are we gonna look at here
02:49:47.040 well we're going to look at some NASA
02:49:48.270 stuff how cool and then we'll look at a
02:49:50.580 couple of Google Earth things and then
02:49:52.319 we will look at some couple of US
02:49:54.689 Geological Survey things and then we'll
02:49:56.850 look at some photographs five deals
02:50:00.449 worth okay let's do it we got well holy
02:50:03.390 [ __ ] this is this is an early one of the
02:50:05.729 early NASA photographs taken from five
02:50:07.770 hundred miles up back in the late 70s
02:50:11.430 actually and what we got here is the two
02:50:13.830 big scab land tracts that show two of
02:50:17.550 the big meltwater streams that have left
02:50:19.680 their their scars in the landscape so
02:50:22.770 each one of those is varies roughly
02:50:26.399 between 10 and 20 miles wide and the
02:50:29.100 bigger one on the right is probably 50
02:50:31.229 to 60 miles long or actually a little
02:50:33.569 bit longer net but you can actually see
02:50:35.310 that when the water swept down from the
02:50:38.069 north out of British Columbia it washed
02:50:40.260 away 200 feet roughly one to two hundred
02:50:43.260 feet of the existing topsoil it had
02:50:45.989 covered the basalt bedrock right basalt
02:50:49.739 bedrock by the way that was originally
02:50:51.300 formed by eruptions of the Yellowstone
02:50:54.180 Caldera interestingly but so the water
02:50:57.689 came down swept
02:50:58.810 way the topsoil and left the bear dark
02:51:02.710 basalt exposed down below the feature
02:51:06.430 that we just looked at is not even
02:51:08.710 really in this NASA photograph it's over
02:51:11.590 to the west but let's go ahead to the
02:51:13.689 next one Jamie with the Snake River down
02:51:17.229 there which is um where's the Snake
02:51:19.689 River Snake River comes up out Idaho and
02:51:22.239 it joins the Columbia and then flows out
02:51:24.909 to the Pacific Ocean alright then we got
02:51:28.689 a Google Earth image coming up ok on
02:51:34.000 order because there's just a lot there's
02:51:35.290 a lot in here oh ok what tell me which
02:51:37.720 number you Emil pol left we one thousand
02:51:39.970 eight one zero zero eight the next one
02:51:42.310 what's going on with our TV keeps going
02:51:44.290 off and on that TV is not really made
02:51:46.239 for the way we use it so it doesn't like
02:51:48.489 the inputs and I just turned it off so I
02:51:50.529 could pull up the next one okay there we
02:51:58.720 go so now we're getting actually a
02:52:00.909 bigger view of the landscape and you can
02:52:03.189 see the two meltwater that's asked a
02:52:06.489 bland tracks mm-hmm here here okay did
02:52:11.770 you have what's called no one can hear
02:52:13.270 you if you do this just just tell me
02:52:15.970 where it is I get it okay so there's the
02:52:18.040 to scab land tracks right then you've
02:52:20.079 got the Grand Coulee which is that dark
02:52:22.989 women going up to Columbia River there
02:52:26.109 Grand Coulee Dam is right almost you
02:52:29.050 almost had it it's where the Columbia
02:52:30.550 River suddenly gets skinny mmm right
02:52:32.979 there that's Grand Coulee Dam that's the
02:52:34.840 widest the most massive concrete dam in
02:52:37.060 North America and it's impounding water
02:52:39.279 in Franklin Delano Roosevelt Lake -
02:52:41.199 about four hundred feet deep right now
02:52:43.479 all of the area at the top the glacier
02:52:46.180 the green mountainous area this was all
02:52:48.130 covered in ice and then over to the left
02:52:51.369 right there you have that brown area and
02:52:54.790 do you see the kind of semicircular arc
02:52:57.010 of dark ground right there yes that is
02:53:00.790 where a tongue of the ice came out of
02:53:03.760 Canada and it stopped right there and
02:53:05.819 when it receded when it melt melted back
02:53:08.909 what it did was it left all this rubble
02:53:11.739 that can't really be fun
02:53:13.000 armed effectively this it's called till
02:53:15.070 glacial till and where the Glade where
02:53:17.410 the glacier ended that's called more
02:53:18.910 moraine moraine and you can see it's
02:53:21.850 circular where the glacier came and then
02:53:24.490 coming right off the snout of the
02:53:26.290 glacier do you see kind of up a ribbony
02:53:29.050 that's a giant scar in the landscape
02:53:31.180 that was formed by a meltwater stream
02:53:33.850 coming off of that ice sheet it's called
02:53:36.070 Moses Coulee hey Randall I think we
02:53:38.290 should keep in mind a lot of the
02:53:39.310 audience aren't actually seeing the
02:53:40.780 visuals on this they're not I mean they
02:53:42.700 take the take away is that all across
02:53:44.650 the Pacific Northwest is a landscape
02:53:46.600 that has been utterly scarred and
02:53:48.250 devastated by gigantic flood that took
02:53:50.740 place 12,000 it's left its marks
02:53:52.800 everywhere and this is right near coeur
02:53:55.180 d'alene so coeur d'alene is from that
02:53:56.980 that's the residue of this immortal Lane
02:53:59.170 right yeah if people go to the Geo
02:54:01.780 cosmic recs website or the sacred
02:54:04.030 geometry international website they can
02:54:05.680 see most of the images that we're
02:54:07.510 showing well they'll see it if they
02:54:08.740 watch the YouTube video they can watch
02:54:10.240 it and hear you talk about it at the
02:54:11.680 same time it's just the the vast
02:54:13.360 majority probably 90% of our you can
02:54:15.280 just leave the visuals right now but
02:54:17.470 they can and so they probably will so
02:54:19.600 they can go to that in watch it you can
02:54:22.750 look down way down on the lower left is
02:54:25.390 the potholes cataract right go up a
02:54:29.560 little up along the river come down
02:54:31.420 south south keep coming keep coming stop
02:54:35.590 look to the right of the river that's
02:54:38.140 what we were just this man does his
02:54:40.030 landscapes to notice to the right to the
02:54:42.940 right to the right Jamie Jamie how dare
02:54:45.730 you yeah this this whole area so we we
02:54:49.930 get it this all over here has been
02:54:51.430 absolutely unequivocably right
02:54:54.700 undeniably you see this Joe and you
02:54:56.770 realize the scale of what we just looked
02:54:58.360 at and now you're seeing that within
02:55:00.250 this whole landscape yeah
02:55:02.230 that was essentially inundated you'll
02:55:05.350 start to get the scale of the thing and
02:55:07.390 that's what I'm trying to do here if you
02:55:08.830 Joe can get the scale of this in your
02:55:10.900 mind I've accomplished something I think
02:55:13.300 I got it from that one image was uh
02:55:15.160 those a real mind blower both yeah the
02:55:17.980 rippers yeah the well the ripples were
02:55:19.780 real mind blower and then the other one
02:55:21.340 with the farmland and then this massive
02:55:23.200 channel cut into it you kind of get it
02:55:25.840 yeah
02:55:26.319 um the ripples aren't even on this image
02:55:28.720 they're their way to the east has
02:55:30.159 anybody sat down with you and tried to
02:55:32.409 dispute this I mean the people that
02:55:34.659 believe that this was a slow and gradual
02:55:36.550 effect does anybody sat down and tried
02:55:38.289 to debate you on this no this seems like
02:55:41.439 something that would be really
02:55:42.489 interesting to debate I mean I would
02:55:44.409 love to see someone who's a geologist
02:55:46.060 that you know that I'm sure there's
02:55:48.010 someone out there that is listening to
02:55:49.839 this that may have a dispute with it
02:55:51.729 that there is I'm sure but I would love
02:55:54.010 to I would love to see them talk to you
02:55:56.709 about it and go over all the various
02:55:59.649 things the nuclear glass that they find
02:56:02.589 the I mean all of it all the tops like
02:56:05.829 here's the thing Joe at this point
02:56:07.419 nobody is connecting the work of the of
02:56:10.029 the comet research group with the
02:56:12.249 Missoula flood effects that we're
02:56:13.569 looking or arrests except up except us
02:56:16.029 yeah that's crazy
02:56:16.899 most people are like that's crazy how is
02:56:18.819 it possible because it's a missing lady
02:56:20.350 it's it's such an obvious it's such an
02:56:22.479 obvious connection and it really merits
02:56:24.279 sex she scares the [ __ ] out of me what
02:56:25.689 if you guys didn't exist what if you
02:56:27.760 guys were never born
02:56:28.600 what if you never wrote that book what
02:56:30.039 if you never been freaking out about
02:56:31.449 this [ __ ] your whole life how would I
02:56:33.189 know how many times in the in the human
02:56:35.169 story as this happened yeah where stuff
02:56:36.909 has just not been explored that really
02:56:38.859 needed to that sounds crazy to something
02:56:40.869 like a Michael Shermer a skeptical
02:56:42.699 person well I'd say to Michael Shermer
02:56:44.439 come on man let's go spend a week out in
02:56:46.239 that landscape well he does wanted to
02:56:47.919 bait you he wants to sit down debate you
02:56:49.810 Graham all right let's can we set that
02:56:51.699 up we can set that up I would love it
02:56:53.649 yeah yeah that's how that sounds that
02:56:55.449 sounds like yes it would be a good time
02:56:57.129 yeah well in my mind there's really no
02:56:59.649 no arguing with with this this evidence
02:57:02.229 I mean well it's too overwhelming and
02:57:03.879 the question really comes down to at
02:57:06.249 this point nobody disputes that there
02:57:08.529 were catastrophic floods the question is
02:57:10.689 what was the mechanism how many were
02:57:12.999 there how long and so long how long did
02:57:15.550 it take
02:57:16.020 was it a bunch of catastrophic but
02:57:18.520 smaller floods or was it back to Brett
02:57:21.520 TSA's original model of one giant flood
02:57:23.649 and I think the truth actually lies
02:57:25.779 somewhere between the two and and again
02:57:28.539 the geology gets complicated but I'm
02:57:30.459 writing it up so I will explain in
02:57:33.129 detail what my thoughts aren't after
02:57:35.619 after having criss-crossed thousands of
02:57:38.499 miles of this landscape
02:57:40.119 heatedly and basically absorbed every
02:57:43.060 piece of scientific literature every
02:57:44.949 written on it I've evolved some ideas
02:57:47.589 about what could have happened here and
02:57:49.449 how it happened well I was a grown adult
02:57:51.219 and I found out that North America most
02:57:55.209 of it was by you know what was it ten
02:57:57.909 twelve thousand years ago was covered by
02:57:59.350 a mile-high sheet of ice I was yes
02:58:02.169 thought I was a grown adult in a way no
02:58:04.060 America roughly north of Minneapolis
02:58:05.619 yeah yeah and that was that's common
02:58:07.959 knowledge right I mean everybody knew
02:58:09.310 that anybody who's actually studied the
02:58:11.169 history of it but it never made it to my
02:58:12.879 dopey head until I was a grown adult and
02:58:15.579 then I went wait a minute wait a minute
02:58:16.629 wait a minute what and the the idea in
02:58:18.789 my mind that this whole thing was
02:58:21.339 covered just 12,000 years ago that seems
02:58:24.249 so incredibly recent by the way that ice
02:58:27.100 was more like two miles deep could
02:58:30.129 consider the weight of those ice masses
02:58:31.689 pressing down I mean anything that was
02:58:33.339 there before the ice came down with it
02:58:35.739 being ground to powder and then as the
02:58:37.869 ice cataclysmic melts everything below
02:58:40.119 it is washed away forever it's like an
02:58:42.009 eraser for the world iterate see that's
02:58:44.409 exactly that's a great phrase and eraser
02:58:46.779 for the world and that is the thing that
02:58:48.579 so many of the skeptics haven't factored
02:58:50.739 into their thinking when you're going
02:58:52.060 whoa where's the evidence yeah the
02:58:54.219 evidence is you've got to understand is
02:58:55.869 that we have to rethink the possibility
02:58:58.119 of evidence once we know that there has
02:59:00.729 been these erasers of the world that
02:59:02.889 have been transpired and not just once
02:59:06.039 but I mean what we're looking at here is
02:59:07.569 probably the most severe events in the
02:59:10.329 last five million years and I have a
02:59:12.579 reason for using that number five
02:59:14.109 million what's the reason
02:59:15.699 well the reason is is based upon the the
02:59:17.619 the severity of the mass extinction we
02:59:20.350 have to go back five million years to
02:59:22.239 find an extinction event of an
02:59:24.850 equivalent level as what occurred at the
02:59:27.669 Younger Dryas it's funny because what I
02:59:29.619 would call a knee-jerk sceptical person
02:59:31.060 would always say that extraordinary
02:59:32.319 claims require extraordinary evidence is
02:59:34.449 there anything more extraordinary than
02:59:36.129 that image of those farmlands and that
02:59:38.139 giant swath cut into the land that's
02:59:40.869 that is the extraordinary that is it yes
02:59:43.270 that that's very right pretty
02:59:44.799 extraordinary and then the core samples
02:59:46.899 the core samples that show this massive
02:59:49.179 fluctuation of temperature yeah yeah
02:59:51.680 that yeah in prekow that coincides with
02:59:54.050 the mountainsides yes yes it's all there
02:59:56.720 is it obviously all leads
02:59:58.609 even if someone like me it leads to an
03:00:00.979 event and this cataclysmic episode
03:00:02.930 immediately precedes the time when we've
03:00:05.120 been told that civilization began yeah
03:00:07.399 that's the other point which is really
03:00:09.229 important we have this huge punctuation
03:00:10.850 mark and then civilization suddenly
03:00:13.340 starts to evolve know it was there
03:00:14.960 before this is a reinvention those
03:00:16.790 hunter-gatherers like those people that
03:00:18.410 you would watch one of those shows or
03:00:19.699 they survive in Alaska you watch those
03:00:21.319 shows yes
03:00:22.160 this shows a great like life below zero
03:00:23.779 is crazy [ __ ] yeah yeah those people
03:00:26.870 would make it
03:00:27.529 those people would make it and they
03:00:28.910 would breed and they would carry on yeah
03:00:30.770 yeah what is that was it's a 1012 oh you
03:00:34.550 could just say it next to me I don't
03:00:37.040 want to interrupt you Joe no worries no
03:00:38.660 worries
03:00:39.109 look at this Wow okay so that to me I'm
03:00:42.229 looking at this after what you've told
03:00:43.370 me that looks like water that is sort of
03:00:45.800 like receded and left these lines in the
03:00:48.229 Silcock way think think of a bathtub
03:00:49.970 ring after Joe you get in here and you
03:00:52.160 take a bath and the water is basically
03:00:54.109 brown with sediment when it has up the
03:00:56.600 clock is away daddy you take a tub rings
03:01:00.130 you leave in sediment your tub a man
03:01:03.020 have you're quoting Genesis and the
03:01:04.790 waters prevailed exceedingly upon the
03:01:07.100 earth and all the high hills were
03:01:08.899 covered Wow not because I'm you know
03:01:11.569 trying to pump the biblical flood model
03:01:13.819 either far from it what I am trying to
03:01:16.160 drop in pictures whenever I realize
03:01:18.170 here's a great quote and it doesn't
03:01:19.550 matter where it's from because there's
03:01:20.479 so many flood legend you can quote from
03:01:22.640 well the political flood model is the it
03:01:25.489 is one of those myths is one of those
03:01:27.439 traditions that have come to one of
03:01:28.939 thousands of traditions that's think of
03:01:30.800 this the whole ancestral memory of the
03:01:33.380 human race is telling us that something
03:01:34.850 terrible happened it's it's also very
03:01:37.189 unfortunate that's all that's all
03:01:38.630 connected with an ideology that a lot of
03:01:40.520 people find problematic like that
03:01:42.920 there's this issues with that being you
03:01:44.779 know religion of course cult or this
03:01:46.609 faith-based beliefs we must immediately
03:01:48.439 realized the flood is not the property
03:01:50.420 of the monotheistic religion because
03:01:52.100 itís found was there in every culture on
03:01:54.529 it also in that a lot of these stories
03:01:56.390 you're talking about massive
03:01:57.529 translations from ancient Hebrew to
03:01:59.689 Latin to Greek and a lot is lost in the
03:02:02.210 process
03:02:02.689 and you're dealing with
03:02:04.229 a lot of these stories were handed down
03:02:05.609 from generation and generation for like
03:02:07.649 what was it like a thousand years before
03:02:09.300 the first version was ever rip salutely
03:02:11.640 absolutely so all that's I mean that is
03:02:14.510 unbelievably fascinating go to 1014
03:02:18.319 one zero one four and we'll see a
03:02:21.899 topographic map yeah whoa
03:02:27.109 now that you know trifles it's like it's
03:02:30.510 crazy looks like something just what
03:02:32.729 like you had a sand castle or some flats
03:02:35.640 and set up and a wave came in and cut
03:02:39.239 through it and then pulled back the wave
03:02:41.249 came from the north and it swept down
03:02:43.829 over the landscape and basically carved
03:02:46.590 and plucked and quarried and gouged and
03:02:49.289 gashed that landscape and this is one of
03:02:52.680 the places Graham and I went if you look
03:02:54.359 right in there you'll see where it says
03:02:55.560 Grand part of Grand Coulee gr a nd right
03:03:00.779 there with the D is we have a great
03:03:02.579 video clip online of me and grey and
03:03:04.560 we're looking at the this actual topo
03:03:06.810 map right here and then surveying the
03:03:09.869 the cataract around us you'll also
03:03:11.970 notice that there's a rock blade just
03:03:14.789 like similar to the one that we just saw
03:03:16.800 in the drone footage in the rock lay
03:03:18.449 human and you recognize the alcoves now
03:03:20.729 yeah and if we go to the next one we
03:03:26.010 have a Google Earth image of 1015 of
03:03:29.100 this feature and there's the Google
03:03:34.649 Earth image and for scale in the upper
03:03:37.890 left hand I've superimposed Niagara
03:03:40.529 Falls at the same scale so you can see
03:03:43.560 by comparison Wow
03:03:46.140 if you see men deny or Falls Jill I did
03:03:48.960 I went when I was a little kid I
03:03:50.220 honestly don't remember I think I went
03:03:52.380 when I was a little kid I have to check
03:03:53.609 with my mom it's impressive
03:03:54.810 you see it but you the point here is
03:03:57.569 that anybody looking at this and you
03:03:59.189 know if the folks look at the the
03:04:01.529 imagery on the online lays out one of
03:04:03.899 the biggest waterfalls in the world one
03:04:06.300 Niagara yeah not in terms of volume no
03:04:09.029 wa naze of the african or something
03:04:11.010 yeah or South American maybe Victoria
03:04:13.050 Falls it depends you know the highest
03:04:15.119 are the greatest volumes is about 200
03:04:17.660 and between 150 and 200 thousand cubic
03:04:20.870 feet per second going over those Falls
03:04:23.180 depending on the flow of the river but
03:04:25.730 the flow that came through here was
03:04:27.740 about 350 million cubic feet per second
03:04:30.851 and left this and yeah for going lying
03:04:34.760 on the Geo cosmic wrecks website there's
03:04:37.220 a video clip of me and Graham down there
03:04:40.220 just just by perch Lake may I ask you a
03:04:43.101 question here yeah
03:04:44.030 now if the water that was creating Grand
03:04:46.220 Canyon or the Niagara Falls rather right
03:04:48.710 up there if that all receded and we
03:04:50.930 could see the bottom wouldn't it look
03:04:53.030 similar to what you see in here the one
03:04:56.150 of Grand Canyon no excuse me
03:04:57.800 not with a dagger Falls right there
03:04:59.271 right above it right there yes it would
03:05:00.950 but on a smaller scale on a smaller
03:05:02.840 scale but like on a smaller scale like
03:05:04.610 some of the smaller features that you
03:05:06.230 see right there right yeah and that's
03:05:07.790 the thing you were saying or it's
03:05:09.440 fractal the interesting thing about
03:05:11.000 water erosion and sedimentation is it's
03:05:13.130 scale invariant so you can look at
03:05:15.290 features and coming up into pictures
03:05:16.910 here I've got a beautiful example of
03:05:18.620 scale invariance where you see the small
03:05:20.570 version in the large version and it's
03:05:22.490 exactly the same thing that's why if you
03:05:24.860 go into any geology text they've always
03:05:26.720 got something in the photographs like a
03:05:29.150 a rock pic or a person standing there
03:05:32.061 otherwise it's hard to get a sense of
03:05:33.891 the scale of what you're looking at
03:05:35.120 right so my question though was that if
03:05:38.271 that's the case if you could drain
03:05:40.490 Niagara Falls and it would have a
03:05:42.470 similar feature set to what you're
03:05:44.450 seeing on the ground there well we know
03:05:46.010 that Niagara Falls has been doing that
03:05:47.300 for a long long time about a thousand
03:05:49.190 years of work of the river at Niagara
03:05:50.780 Falls right here you're looking at a
03:05:52.521 moment in time that unfold it in a few
03:05:54.440 weeks right but how do we know that well
03:05:56.420 for one thing to scale of it because if
03:05:58.340 it because in other words how long would
03:06:01.070 it take
03:06:01.670 Niagara to carve something on this scale
03:06:05.000 if it's taken Niagara 10,000 years say
03:06:08.360 to carve that how long would it take an
03:06:11.450 equivalent flow to carve this but it
03:06:13.880 would never look like if you drained it
03:06:15.620 though what would it look like an
03:06:16.730 equivalent to any of these things for
03:06:18.110 you well right here for one thing it's
03:06:19.370 not basalt bedrock so you're not going
03:06:21.920 to see quite the same type of erosion
03:06:23.391 because really what you what you've got
03:06:24.980 to consider is that all different rock
03:06:26.601 types are Road differently right also
03:06:29.110 you know what happens is you have
03:06:31.550 teams of flow so that what you have in
03:06:34.420 Niagara today is a lower flow regime
03:06:37.819 which doesn't have anywhere near the
03:06:39.800 type of turbulence or erosive potential
03:06:42.680 is when you get water moving at 50 or 60
03:06:45.649 miles an hour
03:06:46.550 one reason we definitely can know that
03:06:48.890 this is the case is because we see the
03:06:51.140 association with the giant current
03:06:52.910 ripples we see the boulders that have
03:06:55.160 been plucked and quarried and some of
03:06:57.020 them are 40 and 50 feet in diameter you
03:06:59.270 see and we'll look at some of those
03:07:01.630 coming up in the next next picture do
03:07:04.580 you have that image that you were
03:07:05.689 talking about before of that one
03:07:07.100 gigantic boulder that was carried on
03:07:09.080 this it's coming up out if we move
03:07:11.030 quickly through here will will get to it
03:07:13.220 so go to go to 1017 and that'll be from
03:07:18.560 the ground view again with Niagara Falls
03:07:21.109 superimposed for scale the Horseshoe
03:07:25.160 Falls the Canadian Falls superimposed
03:07:27.890 for scale now basically that cataract at
03:07:32.000 Horseshoe Falls is about 120 feet in
03:07:34.069 height the cliff wall of this giant
03:07:37.189 cataract is about 400 feet high and then
03:07:39.830 you see the beginning of the blade rock
03:07:41.180 out there and the full extent of the
03:07:44.330 thing actually goes all the way to the
03:07:46.310 horizon but we can't see that beyond
03:07:49.250 there but this erosion goes all the way
03:07:50.930 to the horizon to stone that cut into
03:07:53.660 basalt hard columnar basalt god that was
03:07:57.710 extruded basically with the eruption of
03:07:59.899 the Yellowstone Caldera long 15 million
03:08:04.399 years ago basically but then covered up
03:08:07.250 by a couple of hundred feet of topsoil
03:08:09.350 and then that was exposed when the
03:08:11.510 floods came through go to the next 1018
03:08:17.120 and you'll see an example of some of the
03:08:19.010 debris that was left behind by the
03:08:22.069 floodwaters when they finally ceased
03:08:25.479 there's the stuff that you're looking at
03:08:27.590 now the bigger stuff there is 30 and 40
03:08:30.439 feet those would be like four-story
03:08:32.479 buildings down there so those are just
03:08:34.819 washed away by this gigantic river
03:08:37.100 that's just this this right this massive
03:08:39.229 gigantic river moving 50 60 miles an
03:08:41.899 hour sweeps through there plucks and
03:08:44.860 Aires the bedrock and then when the
03:08:46.900 spigots finally get turned off the water
03:08:49.240 starts subsiding and this stuff that's
03:08:51.400 being carried in there just gets left in
03:08:53.410 the wake just like you're going to see
03:08:54.851 any modern smaller flood is going to
03:08:57.341 leave material in its wake the
03:08:59.080 difference is this material is piles of
03:09:01.931 boulders the size of houses gravel bars
03:09:04.330 two and three hundred feet thick and
03:09:06.250 three miles long and they're all in it
03:09:08.530 so see here's the answer to your
03:09:10.841 question is and this is what how Brett's
03:09:13.091 finally did it was by showing that it
03:09:14.950 was the full suite of evidence taken
03:09:17.801 integrally that created a picture that
03:09:20.290 was undeniable to the skeptics it was
03:09:22.780 just it was overwhelming because it was
03:09:24.761 every piece fit together too perfectly
03:09:27.460 to ignores no other explanation other
03:09:30.400 than gigantic hydraulic events and and
03:09:34.450 now it's a question of the detail what
03:09:37.030 caused them how long did it take and you
03:09:40.301 know that's where the controversy is now
03:09:42.271 this is amazing it's amazing and
03:09:45.431 terrifying but what's cool about is it's
03:09:47.200 terrifying but everything's ok right now
03:09:49.721 everything is ok right now so it's well
03:09:52.360 it's like you feel like a be fine
03:09:54.130 but maybe not if something like this
03:09:56.141 happens again well you have to ask what
03:09:58.360 what could be the change in you know in
03:10:00.820 the human orientation to life on this
03:10:02.860 planet like for example I remember the
03:10:05.591 first Earth Day 1970 right when when
03:10:08.710 this consciousness about hey you know
03:10:10.480 what our existence on this planet is
03:10:13.841 having an effect on this planet right
03:10:15.641 and at that point you see this a whole
03:10:17.200 environmental consciousness emerge that
03:10:19.540 didn't exist before that right well I
03:10:23.290 think maybe in the next decade or two
03:10:24.670 we're going to see a new environmental
03:10:26.230 consciousness that involves the
03:10:29.681 recognition that this planet we live on
03:10:31.570 is a very dynamic place and has been so
03:10:34.960 it is the key to deciphering a lot of
03:10:37.181 mysteries geological cultural historical
03:10:40.360 and and paleontological biological etc
03:10:44.230 that that this has been a dominant
03:10:46.630 factor in the evolution of basically
03:10:49.601 everything that's been going on on this
03:10:50.891 planet whether you're looking at
03:10:52.181 millions of years or thousands of years
03:10:54.540 it's just it's such a strange time
03:10:58.061 to be alive where all this stuff is
03:11:00.011 coming together all this information is
03:11:02.230 being exposed and it's as well there's
03:11:07.091 no hidden archive has young has been
03:11:09.461 broken open and the stuff is spilling
03:11:11.110 out you don't know whether you've opened
03:11:13.330 Pandora's box by letting it out but it's
03:11:16.271 all logical a little large it's so easy
03:11:18.131 to follow it's all I mean it seems like
03:11:20.080 when it comes to like a step by step to
03:11:22.211 1 0 to 9
03:11:24.011 coming up 1 0 to 9 1 felt like I'm a
03:11:26.650 bingo guy
03:11:28.450 now this one we traveled about 500 miles
03:11:30.971 south out onto the Utah Canyon it's
03:11:35.051 beautiful and what you're seeing there
03:11:36.671 is basically dry cataracts now that
03:11:40.900 you've seen these cataracts you can
03:11:43.120 begin to recognize them all over the
03:11:44.711 place now this has not been acknowledged
03:11:47.351 as being a cataract but what you
03:11:50.681 actually see when you look at the modern
03:11:52.181 erosion is that these features are being
03:11:54.341 slowly eroded and eaten away by the
03:11:56.440 modern erosion and it's a different
03:11:58.721 erosional regime altogether that creates
03:12:00.761 features like this and this is a vast
03:12:03.700 scale of erosion here and when you
03:12:05.711 travel over the southwest that is the
03:12:07.751 most striking thing that you're going to
03:12:09.761 experience if you're if you're you know
03:12:12.641 in empathic with the landscape which is
03:12:15.160 that there's been this enormous amount
03:12:16.841 of erosion now I'm not saying that this
03:12:19.181 enormous amount of erosion was all
03:12:20.801 created by one flood but I think what it
03:12:23.141 is possibly saying is that when we go
03:12:25.061 back over several million years gigantic
03:12:28.360 floods on this scale aren't and that
03:12:30.971 exceptional that there's something that
03:12:32.650 from time to time and see here's the
03:12:35.591 thing this is completely removed from
03:12:37.181 the glaciers any water that would have
03:12:39.070 eroded this landscape was not coming
03:12:40.631 from the glaciers it had to have been
03:12:42.011 coming from rainfall go if you go to the
03:12:44.740 next slide Jamie one thought which is
03:12:46.631 not it is not a disconnected element
03:12:48.641 because because of the massive rain out
03:12:51.461 that was that resulted from the impacts
03:12:53.561 on the ice cap what's this
03:12:55.990 this is Valles Caldera this is the
03:12:58.391 largest volcanic caldera in North
03:13:00.160 America oh it's 11 miles across and
03:13:04.320 here's what it was born out of a
03:13:06.910 catastrophe millions of years ago right
03:13:09.610 and then
03:13:11.370 subsequent eruptions over hundreds of
03:13:13.080 thousands of years have left this
03:13:14.400 feature but what's interesting to us
03:13:16.470 here is what happened around 12,000
03:13:18.660 years ago the entire caldera filled up
03:13:21.210 suddenly and if you look at right about
03:13:23.730 if you look at it as a clock at about 8
03:13:25.740 o'clock you can see a breach of Valley
03:13:28.470 coming off you see that you know Jamie
03:13:31.680 can you yeah right there
03:13:33.150 that was the spillover so at the same
03:13:36.630 time now get this at the same window of
03:13:39.030 time that this these flood events are
03:13:42.120 happening up in Washington and Idaho and
03:13:44.040 Montana this caldera suddenly fills up
03:13:47.700 with water and the water spills over the
03:13:50.101 rim and cuts a canyon hundreds of feet
03:13:52.200 deep now what could cause that to
03:13:55.230 suddenly fill up with water and it's
03:13:56.910 completely removed it's not receiving
03:13:58.620 glacial meltwater there's only one thing
03:14:01.230 by default and that would be rainfall a
03:14:03.180 lot of rainfall falling over days and
03:14:06.780 days at a time so if you go to the next
03:14:11.000 slide we'll see what sits down in the
03:14:13.950 bottom of this valley is thousands of
03:14:18.630 these gigantic rolled boulders and you
03:14:21.420 know that their water transported
03:14:23.010 because they're round they're rolled
03:14:24.390 that's what water does it rolls these
03:14:26.220 things now this is in New Mexico see so
03:14:29.640 this is related to the spillway the
03:14:31.740 overflow of all its caldera which has
03:14:33.630 been dated to that same interval when
03:14:36.840 the floods were happening up north the
03:14:38.610 same interval that now the comet is
03:14:40.860 dating to is this coincidence or are the
03:14:43.771 two related I would say it would be very
03:14:45.750 premature to dismiss it and say that
03:14:47.970 they're not related to that because as
03:14:49.800 Graham just said one of the ones that
03:14:51.960 one of the consequences of an impact
03:14:53.610 whether it's in to the ocean or the ice
03:14:55.440 sheet is you're going to have extreme
03:14:57.720 amounts of water vapor injected
03:15:00.180 catastrophic ly into the atmosphere
03:15:01.880 which is then going to rain out in in
03:15:05.190 incredible torrential downpours that
03:15:07.890 might last for days at a time and along
03:15:11.010 with that water vapor is a tremendous
03:15:12.811 amount of particulate mass and it's that
03:15:14.760 rain out that I would say caused the
03:15:16.710 erosion on the Sphinx and tells us that
03:15:18.601 the Sphinx is 12,000 years old not 2500
03:15:22.110 BC you guys are freaking me out
03:15:24.170 this is amazing this is the most
03:15:27.689 convincing argument yet that you guys
03:15:29.790 have ever made it's all it's all been
03:15:34.529 convinced this is this is more
03:15:36.330 compelling and and then it all the
03:15:38.399 pieces let's go them together ya know
03:15:40.770 the next slide Jamie which would be 1032
03:15:45.180 which is to me a beautiful example of
03:15:47.399 scale and variance Wow here we have the
03:15:50.010 modern snake river flowing in the modern
03:15:52.290 Channel and then we have the ancient
03:15:55.229 flood channel and which you can see
03:15:57.930 there the average annual discharge of
03:16:00.060 the snake fifty six thousand nine
03:16:01.830 hundred cubic feet but the estimated
03:16:04.470 flood that created the big channel is 40
03:16:06.899 million cubic feet and now this flood
03:16:10.109 actually was coming up get this out of
03:16:12.810 Utah it was coming up it was part of the
03:16:15.450 giant Lake Bonneville of which the Great
03:16:18.930 Salt Lake is but a diminutive remnant so
03:16:22.109 the Bonneville Salt Flats the Bonneville
03:16:23.880 Salt Flats were the bottom of this
03:16:25.620 gigantic lake that that filled the
03:16:28.290 basins of northeastern Utah and at the
03:16:31.410 end of the last ice age it suddenly
03:16:33.960 filled up very rapidly and spilled over
03:16:36.420 a mountain pass to the north and then
03:16:39.149 flooded the South the Snake River plain
03:16:41.790 of southern Idaho and anybody can see
03:16:43.710 the Snake River plain if you go to
03:16:45.210 Google Earth or any topographic map and
03:16:47.580 it cut channels like this that
03:16:49.620 ultimately led to the Columbia River but
03:16:52.170 interestingly the dating of this puts it
03:16:54.720 again right in that window so that
03:16:58.890 window of twelve thousand eight hundred
03:17:00.270 to eleven thousand six hundred years ago
03:17:02.010 when everything changes yes everything
03:17:04.560 changes and so what I'm showing you is
03:17:06.420 just a little bit selecting random
03:17:08.460 almost dots to show you that no matter
03:17:11.609 where you look you're going to see
03:17:12.840 evidence of these of these events
03:17:15.090 imprinted into the landscape yeah go to
03:17:19.109 the next slide
03:17:20.100 1033 and if you go down and you stand on
03:17:23.910 that floodplain down there you'll see
03:17:27.120 the kind of stuff that got left behind
03:17:29.630 this is the sediment load being carried
03:17:32.640 in the flood Wow
03:17:34.100 so you got what kind of powerful
03:17:36.749 currents are necessary to transport and
03:17:39.180 I'm standing in the canyon that was cut
03:17:41.520 by the flood those walls are 400 feet
03:17:43.919 high so what we would think of as being
03:17:45.959 like little pebbles at the bottom of a
03:17:47.609 stream gets moved around yes
03:17:50.130 nice grand scale this is like sand
03:17:52.380 grains on the bottom of a modern little
03:17:54.419 creek but or River said that humongous
03:17:56.729 boulders yes and this is what a
03:17:59.100 geologist or geomorphologist would call
03:18:01.050 the bedload the stuff being swept along
03:18:02.819 in in the flood waters be rolled and
03:18:06.119 tumble and geologists recognize this but
03:18:09.060 they think took mainstream geologists
03:18:11.369 think it took along no I mean did the
03:18:13.020 few geological lepers that have been
03:18:15.600 written on this admit that it was a one
03:18:17.459 big catastrophic flood Wow and what is
03:18:20.100 their explanation for that catastrophic
03:18:21.779 flood
03:18:22.499 well that somehow Lake Bonneville rose
03:18:25.050 up and and something right breached a
03:18:27.779 pass and its northern rim but you know
03:18:31.409 is that possible in any way well yeah if
03:18:34.109 you have enough rainfall prolonged over
03:18:36.029 a period of time days or weeks that the
03:18:39.300 whole body water could have raised by
03:18:40.739 300 feet roughly and then it bet you
03:18:42.689 again you would need something like the
03:18:44.669 comet impact to provide you with a
03:18:46.169 source for that rainfall right because
03:18:47.760 otherwise there's no other explanation
03:18:48.840 for that ever that kind of rainfall and
03:18:51.029 it's known from the modeling of oceanic
03:18:53.729 impacts that yes there would be
03:18:55.640 unbelievable rain out in the aftermath
03:18:57.869 of an oceanic impact and clearly the
03:19:00.329 same thing would follow in the wake of
03:19:02.699 an ice impact what oceanic impacts we
03:19:05.369 have on record only a few of them armed
03:19:07.520 there's one up by Sweden we were
03:19:10.590 discussing also the possible Indian
03:19:12.539 Ocean impact possibly one in the Indian
03:19:14.399 Ocean 5,000 years ago which which
03:19:16.709 creates tsunamis on both sides of the
03:19:19.260 Indian Ocean dated - a massive massive
03:19:21.569 tsunami disposal deposits and again the
03:19:26.069 this whole argument of the Younger Dryas
03:19:28.010 cataclysm between twelve thousand eight
03:19:29.970 hundred and eleven thousand six hundred
03:19:31.319 years ago the strongest case is the the
03:19:34.829 focus of the science has been on twelve
03:19:36.479 thousand eight hundred years ago but
03:19:37.919 there's a lot of interest in the eleven
03:19:39.449 thousand six hundred years ago as well
03:19:40.979 and the strongest suggestion of what
03:19:44.430 caused that that sudden rise in
03:19:46.289 temperatures are come
03:19:47.580 need by meltwater pulse well one B was a
03:19:50.940 second encounter with more fragments of
03:19:53.850 the debris of the comet this time the
03:19:56.070 impacts not being on the North American
03:19:57.990 ice camp but in a major ocean probably
03:20:00.720 the Pacific and that that then puts a
03:20:03.420 huge plume of water vapor into the upper
03:20:05.850 atmosphere and shrouds the earth and
03:20:07.920 creates the greenhouse effect that
03:20:10.110 accounts for the radical rise in
03:20:11.880 temperature that occurred eleven
03:20:13.561 thousand six hundred years ago more
03:20:15.480 science needs to be done on that it's
03:20:17.160 another reason why I want to see the
03:20:18.420 comet research group funded because this
03:20:20.160 is this is important work guide Amazon
03:20:23.400 awesome podcast mmm this might be my
03:20:25.860 all-time favorite yeah okay we'll talk
03:20:29.220 about half a dozen more key yeah for
03:20:31.470 sure let's roll okay one thousand and
03:20:33.450 thirty nine and this is here now you'll
03:20:37.320 be able to see actually a person in the
03:20:39.360 in the field of view next to one a giant
03:20:41.760 current ripple and there's a giant
03:20:46.200 that's a giant current ripple field we
03:20:48.030 did see this one green this is the West
03:20:49.710 bar very cool yes if you go back one
03:20:54.420 slide we can see an aerial photo I took
03:20:56.940 years ago of West bar it's three miles
03:20:59.910 long there it is whoa
03:21:03.510 and there's an airport down the
03:21:05.460 lighter-colored buffs of is a landing
03:21:07.860 strip and the the airport building there
03:21:12.090 is three stories tall so this whole
03:21:14.100 feature is three miles long and the
03:21:17.550 ripples here are on the same scale as
03:21:19.410 the Camas Prairie ripples that we just
03:21:21.510 looked at of course this is in Central
03:21:23.940 Washington the other one was in Montana
03:21:25.680 so again you as we begin to place these
03:21:29.030 event nodes around on the map we can
03:21:32.250 begin to see the outlines of a really
03:21:34.590 really huge event and all of this is
03:21:37.021 going on at the same time you've sort of
03:21:38.550 this is dated at the same time all this
03:21:40.650 is dated to the same time that you think
03:21:43.170 the impact took place and it's all over
03:21:46.080 that coast the only dates that we have
03:21:48.900 that our hard dates are a volcanic ash
03:21:51.030 primarily from Mount st. Helens the date
03:21:53.910 at 13,000 years but they use that as a
03:21:56.970 baseline and then assume the
03:21:59.271 there was multiple floods and each flood
03:22:01.940 was separated by fifty to a hundred
03:22:03.591 years and what they've done is they've
03:22:05.990 gone from Rex's original model of a
03:22:08.480 single flood into a dozen floods into
03:22:10.521 forty floods and now up to 80 or 90
03:22:12.830 floods which I disagree with but on the
03:22:16.131 other hand there were see I think you
03:22:18.351 have to understand this in two phases
03:22:20.660 because the anit impact phase is going
03:22:23.421 to melt a whole lot of ice all of a
03:22:25.341 sudden but it's not going to melt all of
03:22:27.080 it it's going to leave a huge amount of
03:22:29.961 residual ice in the aftermath now what
03:22:33.051 we see is that particularly after the
03:22:35.381 11,600 year-ago event at that point the
03:22:38.900 whole planet comes right out of the Ice
03:22:40.551 Age inexplicable s the end of the ice
03:22:42.801 that's the end of the Ice Age the
03:22:44.301 beginning of the Holocene it's over and
03:22:46.221 and basically what we're seeing here is
03:22:49.610 that there is a great deal of heat
03:22:52.131 suddenly that's brought the planet out
03:22:54.021 of the icy it does not convert revert
03:22:56.330 back into the Ice Age like it did it to
03:22:58.931 12,900 event C so what we then have is
03:23:03.171 that in the aftermath of this event the
03:23:05.990 whole climate of the earth has been
03:23:08.360 completely altered the whole balance of
03:23:10.551 nature has been completely altered from
03:23:13.400 before these events to after these
03:23:15.650 events but what you have now is a lot of
03:23:18.381 residual ice that takes about two or
03:23:20.360 three thousand years to melt away so sea
03:23:22.370 levels continue to rise sea levels
03:23:24.051 continue to rise and the melting of this
03:23:26.900 ice produces some pretty big floods but
03:23:30.110 not on the scale of what we're looking
03:23:32.120 at here and I think it's my personal
03:23:34.011 opinion that there's a confusion between
03:23:36.351 the two different flood regimes and I'm
03:23:39.501 going to document all I'm writing all
03:23:41.120 this up in detail as a like as a thesis
03:23:44.211 to explain my interpretation of the
03:23:48.771 phenomena over you know 20 years but
03:23:50.990 let's go to that would be so important I
03:23:54.051 would love to see people really go over
03:23:56.660 this with a fine-tooth comb because it's
03:23:58.251 so compelling she's so amazing like just
03:24:00.471 this image itself is just wow what would
03:24:03.320 what kind of power and force would it
03:24:06.650 take to create those ripples those 50
03:24:08.660 foot high ripples all over the place
03:24:10.160 miles and miles and miles of the
03:24:12.291 yeah and and see nothing since that
03:24:14.480 event has really affected them they're
03:24:16.521 still sitting there's these gigantic
03:24:18.171 monstrous fossil features in the
03:24:20.271 landscape now when they do core samples
03:24:22.311 on that stuff what do they find out like
03:24:23.780 as far as the dating of it like if they
03:24:25.610 get bottom one of those ripples well
03:24:27.411 you've got to find a lot you've got to
03:24:29.721 be able to find organic material right
03:24:31.820 in there and to the extent that there's
03:24:33.681 organic material it basically all dates
03:24:36.021 from the end of the Ice Age the problem
03:24:37.641 is is when you have a flood like this
03:24:39.110 coming through it's sweeping up
03:24:41.360 everything in its path including forests
03:24:43.940 and animals so if you've got a bone in
03:24:46.070 there or a piece of wood that doesn't
03:24:48.921 necessarily mean when the flood happened
03:24:50.570 right it's not a nice layer of said
03:24:52.791 layers of sediment it's a jumble yeah
03:24:55.070 messed up kij chaotic mess it's not like
03:24:59.061 you could just go dig into the side of
03:25:00.530 that hill at that same level and find
03:25:02.570 something that's organic and absolutely
03:25:04.761 dated to that because that's all stone
03:25:05.931 right right it's boulders it is if you
03:25:08.421 saw a cross-section of one of those
03:25:09.741 ripples it's it's just a jumbled chaotic
03:25:12.471 mess of everything from finest sand and
03:25:15.051 silt up to boulders the size of cars and
03:25:17.391 even houses and stuff just yeah that's
03:25:20.931 so crazy go to 10:41 and we'll see an
03:25:23.991 interesting artist rendition by edward
03:25:28.221 Riau who did all the illustrations for
03:25:30.621 the jewels original Jules Verne books
03:25:32.360 and he did a version for Anna straw
03:25:34.701 straw geology text was the guy's name is
03:25:39.860 skipping me right now but I thought it
03:25:41.391 was an interesting image because it
03:25:42.801 basically shows an event on the scale of
03:25:45.891 what we're talking about and what's
03:25:48.711 interesting here is you see that the
03:25:50.150 torrents are carrying icebergs and in
03:25:52.190 this one iceberg in the foreground
03:25:53.900 I call it grams rock from now on it's
03:25:56.900 going to be I have officially turned
03:25:59.301 aimed at graves it's carrying it I can
03:26:01.221 get one dress I or we're talking about
03:26:03.320 it it's now it's grams yeah because I
03:26:05.451 went and climbed that it's no longer the
03:26:07.011 Wenatchee erratic rush is the grammar
03:26:09.320 addict I'm on a drive thank you okay so
03:26:12.741 we got the grammar addict coming up in
03:26:14.961 about three images so let's go to the
03:26:16.851 next one ten forty two and this is
03:26:19.251 basically another key piece of evidence
03:26:22.161 is strewn for thousands of square miles
03:26:25.101 throughout the
03:26:25.910 out of the flood you have these gigantic
03:26:27.950 boulders and these are being carried
03:26:30.500 aboard icebergs let me let me describe
03:26:32.630 what we're looking at right now because
03:26:33.860 as a person is that you there I took the
03:26:36.320 picture so it's two of my fellow
03:26:38.540 travelers
03:26:39.170 okay normal sized people and you know
03:26:41.690 whatever six feet tall and and bounce
03:26:44.510 them on top of each other
03:26:46.990 12:18 you're looking at probably at
03:26:50.420 least 35 40 feet tall right now yeah and
03:26:53.271 and wider wider than it is tall oh yeah
03:26:56.960 60 feet wide does that's insane and that
03:26:59.570 was carried by water it was carried it
03:27:01.521 was carried on icebergs yeah in the
03:27:03.740 water oh my god so this one this flood
03:27:06.650 is not just water it's it's a huge
03:27:08.690 thousands of icebergs it's forests up by
03:27:11.480 their boots it's a jumbling massive
03:27:13.820 powerful erosive flow amazing thousands
03:27:17.510 of megafauna are done doubt in fact a
03:27:19.460 lot of the there have been a lot of
03:27:22.360 mammoth remains found in missoula flood
03:27:25.311 sediments they're generally in the
03:27:26.720 Willamette Valley okay let's go to the
03:27:29.630 next image there we go this is I like
03:27:32.960 out in the middle of the Prairie again
03:27:34.820 you got thousands of these things I'll
03:27:36.470 tell you what I'm a chicken I wouldn't
03:27:37.610 stand right there I think that thing's
03:27:39.080 gonna roll on top of you that would be a
03:27:41.330 wrap son yeah this is known as Yeager
03:27:44.540 raw that thing's huge
03:27:46.400 and is that you want to eat there no
03:27:48.320 that's one of my try took the pictures
03:27:50.030 tell him stand there yeah I said stand
03:27:51.980 there and I had the other guys go around
03:27:53.450 the back
03:27:54.141 Rock Bush I this thing is kind of
03:27:57.920 hanging off the side of that hill the
03:27:59.870 way some of those Hollywood Hills houses
03:28:01.400 are uh-huh on stilts see that that that
03:28:04.150 rounded mass of stuff that it's sitting
03:28:06.260 in is called a Berg Mound
03:28:07.820 and you see these icebergs are not clean
03:28:10.340 ice they're dirty they're filled with
03:28:11.840 gravel and debris so in a Berg when a
03:28:14.570 Berg that's being carried in the flood
03:28:16.370 and the floodwaters subside the Berg's
03:28:18.620 get stranded in the land they then melt
03:28:21.590 and if there's no Boulder there's just a
03:28:24.200 mound if there's no gigantic Boulder
03:28:26.330 there's just a mound but if there is a
03:28:28.521 gigantic Boulder being carried aboard
03:28:30.620 the iceberg it will be sitting in a berg
03:28:33.230 mound like you see right that's amazing
03:28:35.150 so that white line that we see was where
03:28:37.370 the iceberg was when it deposited that
03:28:39.489 thing than it just melted from there no
03:28:41.199 that's actually a bedding plane between
03:28:43.629 two different kinds of basalt so okay so
03:28:46.659 the mound itself below it is what you're
03:28:49.359 saying is the burgh mound that's the
03:28:50.709 Berg Mountain and the boulder the big
03:28:52.930 boulder was the cargo sitting on top of
03:28:55.149 the iceberg okay so the Berg is not just
03:28:59.140 water it's water with a bunch of dirt
03:29:00.669 and all kinds of other [ __ ] in as well
03:29:01.989 yeah and so when it melts that's what it
03:29:03.609 leaves behind it leaves bhai
03:29:06.220 that's amazing okay in the next image we
03:29:09.159 have the hancock array that you up there
03:29:12.159 well that's me on top of that back in
03:29:13.959 the eighteen thousand tunnel there once
03:29:17.319 you bryggen walk yeah I was I do that
03:29:20.379 from time to time but it but it it's an
03:29:23.079 amazing experience to stand there and to
03:29:24.520 think what transported this well we know
03:29:26.949 it was transported in an iceberg and it
03:29:28.720 was dumped there on the side of that
03:29:29.979 Valley and it's just the thought of
03:29:31.930 thousands of these things plowing along
03:29:34.600 at 60 or 70 miles an hour carried on a
03:29:36.999 gigantic flood how do we have anything
03:29:39.339 left you know no wonder no wonder we've
03:29:42.220 forgotten our past and say and here's
03:29:43.930 the thing I mean what we're doing here
03:29:45.459 is we're looking where these flood
03:29:47.259 events are preserved the most
03:29:48.759 spectacularly and the reason is is
03:29:50.529 because you had a very steep gradient
03:29:52.959 from the ice sheet elevation to the
03:29:54.819 Pacific Ocean
03:29:55.720 but like Graham and I when we traveled
03:29:58.479 across we traveled across the
03:30:00.430 Continental Divide and traveled from the
03:30:03.189 Rocky Mountains to the Twin Cities which
03:30:05.199 is on the Mississippi River and all the
03:30:07.270 way across we were caught crossing huge
03:30:09.459 meltwater Cooley's we crossed the
03:30:11.890 Missouri River Valley which is an under
03:30:13.629 fit stream just very similar to the
03:30:15.369 snake where the modern Missouri is just
03:30:17.799 a little ribbon of river occupying this
03:30:20.140 massive meltwater channel of which there
03:30:23.199 are hundreds across the plains and then
03:30:25.720 when we got to Minneapolis we went up
03:30:27.549 and we visited some of the larger known
03:30:29.680 PHA mazing potholes we go again you're
03:30:32.799 looking on the scale of giants this is
03:30:34.749 this is beyond imagination what you look
03:30:37.810 at and and the only this the flood
03:30:40.149 explanation makes sense of it go to go
03:30:42.549 to 1:05 for Jamie and you'll see there
03:30:49.209 we go I'm down inside the pothole one of
03:30:52.149 the potholes
03:30:52.970 hanging up at gram so that's a pothole
03:30:54.950 carved into stone by whirlpool yeah
03:30:58.569 picking up rocks in them and the rock
03:31:01.220 said the erosive agent that's cutting
03:31:02.899 out the pothole just think like a
03:31:05.739 massive hydraulic drill Wow
03:31:09.050 just picking up you know coarse rock and
03:31:11.569 then just good drilling literally
03:31:14.180 drilling holes 50 60 80 feet deep again
03:31:17.330 go to the YouTube please if you're
03:31:19.430 listening to this just go just you gotta
03:31:22.550 fast forward to this this is insane this
03:31:24.439 image is insane just thinking of
03:31:26.720 watching rocks spin around now reeling
03:31:30.020 into the ground and you're talking about
03:31:31.040 over a short period of time oh yeah
03:31:33.069 probably you know I'm guessing you know
03:31:35.120 these giant meltwater floods this is
03:31:37.010 right along the st. Croix River which
03:31:38.540 forms the border between Minnesota and
03:31:40.580 Wisconsin
03:31:41.620 it was probably of several weeks
03:31:44.000 duration as its peaked at its peak and
03:31:46.520 so the drilling of the bedrock probably
03:31:49.550 was accomplished within that time span
03:31:52.210 what I wouldn't give to know what that
03:31:55.220 was like
03:31:55.939 just to see it well you'd have had to be
03:31:58.819 in an orbit to survive it right yeah
03:32:01.340 even if you're flying over in a plane
03:32:02.840 probably they're just the atmospheric
03:32:04.700 change this is on top of these flood
03:32:07.939 sediments from I've documented it from
03:32:10.700 Ohio to Washington State there are thick
03:32:13.130 layers of loss
03:32:14.540 now Loess is this strange topsoil that
03:32:18.590 came down and it's they've been arguing
03:32:21.080 for generations is it when deposited or
03:32:24.140 water deposited but the curious thing is
03:32:26.660 it seems to be both wind and water
03:32:28.880 deposited but I think the obvious
03:32:31.689 explanation for it is this that when you
03:32:34.609 see the like the top layers of the flood
03:32:37.880 sediments particularly in the back flood
03:32:39.950 regions where the where the water was
03:32:41.689 calm or rather than so torrential you
03:32:44.300 see these layers these beautiful they're
03:32:46.819 called rhythmites they're very
03:32:48.140 rhythmical on top of that is a layer of
03:32:51.109 this lost topsoil with this vertical
03:32:53.479 structure right well to me and again
03:32:57.529 without getting into the technical
03:32:58.700 background I think the logical
03:33:00.410 explanation and most likely explanation
03:33:01.939 is that at the tail end of the the final
03:33:05.149 flood flows what you're seeing is
03:33:06.770 is a rainfall of mud and this rainfall
03:33:10.220 of mud came down and which many ancient
03:33:13.069 traditions speak of yes black bituminous
03:33:15.560 rain mud falling from the sky darkness a
03:33:19.130 time of darkness it's all described in
03:33:21.350 the myth myths are the memory banks of
03:33:23.539 humanity we should not call the myths we
03:33:25.909 should call them memories yeah exactly
03:33:27.560 and again this this muddy rainfall
03:33:30.920 perfectly fits the whole narrative and
03:33:33.739 yeah with the mythology it's it's right
03:33:36.770 there when we think of these the the
03:33:38.600 idea of these tsunamis we think of water
03:33:40.189 that you can see we're most likely
03:33:42.050 dealing with the entire air around you
03:33:44.090 filled with a rental downpour and solid
03:33:46.819 matter everything's flying through the
03:33:48.949 air slurry incredible winds incredible
03:33:52.550 winds yes
03:33:53.539 so it's both wind and water and just
03:33:55.760 full-on chaos super hurricanes its
03:33:58.699 nature gone chaotic and crazy on
03:34:02.239 ultimate steroids wow this is what it's
03:34:05.060 so wild and it's real that's the thing
03:34:07.579 this time while people were alive
03:34:09.350 oh yeah and after a while people were
03:34:10.850 alive absolutely it's not a dinosaur
03:34:13.310 thing no it happened a blink of an eye
03:34:15.109 ago it happened it happened when
03:34:16.699 anatomically modern humans had already
03:34:18.229 been around for two hundred thousand
03:34:20.300 years writing well no they but not
03:34:22.760 according to the Orthodox historians but
03:34:24.949 if we're dealing with a lost
03:34:25.880 civilization which I believe to be the
03:34:27.500 case then yes it's totally totally makes
03:34:29.930 sense mmm
03:34:30.739 completely totally makes sense yeah and
03:34:33.199 it's time it's time to get to grips with
03:34:34.850 this it's time to move move forward to
03:34:36.710 the next level and start recovering our
03:34:38.810 memory yeah we also start recognizing
03:34:40.640 this is this is a potential reality yeah
03:34:43.819 this is a not just the past this is very
03:34:47.090 possible and and again if I may say so
03:34:51.430 crowdfunding it's the opportunity for
03:34:54.619 the people to give their voice show can
03:34:56.239 you show that page this is the the
03:34:57.710 crowdfunding page for the comet research
03:35:00.260 group and it's on in the link is on
03:35:04.310 Graham hanger there it is so if you go
03:35:05.989 to Graham Hancock comm and click on the
03:35:08.479 comet research group banner then you'll
03:35:11.239 you'll get taken immediately to the
03:35:13.069 crowdfunding page please support it
03:35:15.079 whatever you can give it'll make all the
03:35:17.479 difference it sends a message that we
03:35:19.159 that we
03:35:19.940 care about alternative heretical
03:35:22.181 research and also while you're at my
