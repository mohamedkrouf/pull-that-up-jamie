00:00:00.640 welcome back
00:00:02.159 here we go again great to see you and
00:00:03.360 congratulations thank you um you will
00:00:06.240 never forget what is going on in the
00:00:08.240 world when you think about when your
00:00:10.240 child is born you will know for the rest
00:00:12.240 of this child's life you were born
00:00:14.639 during a weird time that's for sure
00:00:17.600 that is for sure
00:00:19.119 they're probably the weirdest that i can
00:00:20.960 remember
00:00:21.920 uh yeah yeah um and he was born on uh
00:00:24.560 may the fourth and yeah that's hilarious
00:00:26.800 too yeah may the fourth be with him yeah
00:00:29.039 exactly it has to be hopefully i sure
00:00:30.880 hope so perfect yes i mean that was the
00:00:32.640 perfect day for you
00:00:34.640 and
00:00:35.440 how do you say the name
00:00:38.960 well uh is it a placeholder first of all
00:00:41.840 my partner is the one that actually
00:00:43.680 mostly came up with the name
00:00:44.800 congratulations to her yeah yeah she's
00:00:46.559 great at names um so
00:00:49.200 i mean it's just
00:00:50.480 x the letter x
00:00:52.399 um and then
00:00:54.079 the ae is like pronounced ash
00:00:59.520 yeah
00:01:00.480 and then
00:01:01.440 a12 a12 is my contribution
00:01:04.080 oh why a12 uh archangel 12 the precursor
00:01:07.600 to the sr-71 coolest plane ever
00:01:12.000 that's true i i agree with you i don't
00:01:14.080 know i'm not familiar with it i know
00:01:15.520 what the sr-71 is yeah yeah yeah i know
00:01:17.680 what that is so the sr71 came from a cia
00:01:20.400 program uh
00:01:21.600 called archangel oh it's the archangel
00:01:23.680 project
00:01:24.880 and then archangel 12. oh wow what a
00:01:26.479 dope-looking plane yeah
00:01:28.080 oh okay i got it yeah well as a person
00:01:30.320 who's uh
00:01:31.680 very much into uh
00:01:33.439 aerial travel as you are that's uh
00:01:36.000 perfect that's pretty great yeah pretty
00:01:37.600 great
00:01:38.400 um
00:01:39.360 so is it does it feel strange to have a
00:01:42.320 child while this craziness is going does
00:01:44.079 it feel like you've had children before
00:01:46.000 is this any weirder
00:01:49.200 uh it's actually i think it's better uh
00:01:52.399 being older and having a kid i
00:01:54.479 appreciate it more
00:01:56.079 um yeah
00:01:57.840 babies are awesome they are pretty
00:01:59.520 awesome they're awesome yeah when i
00:02:01.600 didn't have my any of my own i would see
00:02:03.759 other people's kids and i didn't not
00:02:06.000 like them sure but i wasn't drawn to
00:02:07.840 them sure but now when i see little
00:02:09.598 people's kids i'm like oh i think of
00:02:11.360 them like these little love packages
00:02:12.879 yeah little love bugs yeah it's just you
00:02:15.120 you think of them differently when you
00:02:16.400 see them come out and then grow and then
00:02:18.400 eventually start talking to you
00:02:20.400 like your whole idea what a baby is is
00:02:22.160 very different yeah so now as you you
00:02:24.720 know get older and get to appreciate it
00:02:26.640 as a mature
00:02:28.160 fully formed adult
00:02:30.239 it must be really
00:02:31.599 pretty wonderful yeah
00:02:33.360 wonderful it's great but babies are
00:02:34.800 awesome yeah yeah that's uh that's great
00:02:37.920 um
00:02:39.440 yeah um
00:02:41.599 i mean also i've i've spent a lot of
00:02:43.280 time on ai and neural nets and so you
00:02:45.599 can sort of see
00:02:47.040 the kind of the brain develop which is
00:02:49.920 you know what
00:02:51.440 an ai neural net is trying to simulate
00:02:53.360 what a brain does basically um and you
00:02:56.239 can sort of see the
00:02:58.159 it
00:02:58.959 learning very quickly
00:03:01.280 you know it's just wow
00:03:03.519 see things fire so you're talking about
00:03:05.200 the neural net you're not talking about
00:03:06.800 an actual baby i don't know about
00:03:08.080 actually an actual baby but both of them
00:03:10.080 yes but the word neural net comes from
00:03:12.720 the the brain it's like a
00:03:14.640 net of neurons
00:03:16.239 so
00:03:17.040 you know it's like the
00:03:19.200 yeah
00:03:20.080 humans are the
00:03:22.080 you know original gangster the neural
00:03:24.080 net
00:03:26.400 that's a great way to put it yeah so
00:03:28.159 when you're
00:03:29.519 programming artificial intelligence
00:03:31.360 where you're working with artificial
00:03:32.400 intelligence art
00:03:33.840 are they specifically trying to mimic
00:03:36.319 the developmental process of a human
00:03:38.799 brain
00:03:41.040 in a lot of ways there's some ways that
00:03:42.959 are different um you know an analogy
00:03:45.200 that's often used is like you know we we
00:03:47.519 don't make
00:03:48.560 a submarine swim like a fish
00:03:50.959 but we take the principles of of how
00:03:54.720 you know what of hydrodynamics and apply
00:03:57.200 them to a submarine i've always wondered
00:03:59.599 as a lay person do you try to achieve
00:04:01.519 the same results as a human brain but
00:04:03.680 through different methods or do you try
00:04:05.360 to copy the way a human brain achieves
00:04:07.920 results
00:04:10.720 i mean the essential elements of
00:04:13.360 an ai neural net are
00:04:15.760 really very very similar to a
00:04:18.399 human brain neural net yeah
00:04:21.839 it's having the multiple layers of
00:04:23.360 neurons and
00:04:26.160 you know back propagation these all
00:04:27.919 these things are what your brain does
00:04:29.360 you know it's sort of
00:04:31.520 yeah um
00:04:33.840 you have a layer of neurons that goes
00:04:35.199 through a series of intermediate steps
00:04:36.639 to ultimately cognition and that and
00:04:39.280 then it'll
00:04:40.479 reverse those steps and go back and
00:04:42.000 forth and go all over the place
00:04:43.759 um
00:04:45.120 it's um
00:04:47.040 yeah it's it's
00:04:49.120 interesting very interesting
00:04:50.880 yeah i would imagine
00:04:52.720 like the thought of programming
00:04:54.639 something that is eventually going to be
00:04:56.960 smarter than us
00:04:58.320 that one day it's going to be like why
00:05:00.080 did you do it that way
00:05:01.600 like when artificial intelligence
00:05:03.440 becomes sentient they're like oh you
00:05:04.960 tried to mimic yourself like this so
00:05:07.360 much better process cut out all this
00:05:09.440 nonsense
00:05:11.360 but like there are elements that are the
00:05:12.800 same but just almost like like an
00:05:14.800 aircraft does not fly like a bird
00:05:17.360 right yeah it doesn't flap its wings
00:05:19.680 but the wings
00:05:21.520 the way the wings work and generate lift
00:05:23.680 is the same as bird
00:05:27.039 now you're
00:05:28.240 in the middle of this uh
00:05:30.960 this strange time where you're selling
00:05:33.280 your houses you say you don't want any
00:05:34.880 material possessions and i've been
00:05:36.720 seeing all that and i've been really
00:05:37.600 excited to talk to you about this yeah
00:05:39.120 because it's an interesting thing to
00:05:40.240 come from a guy like yourself
00:05:42.320 like why are you doing that
00:05:44.320 i'm slightly sad about it actually
00:05:46.479 but
00:05:48.400 if you're sad about it why are you doing
00:05:49.759 it
00:05:54.320 i think i think possessions kind of
00:05:56.400 weigh you down
00:05:58.560 then they're kind of an attack vector
00:06:01.840 you know people say hey billionaire you
00:06:03.600 got all this stuff like well and now i
00:06:05.280 don't have stuff now what are you gonna
00:06:06.720 do
00:06:08.479 attack vector meaning like people target
00:06:10.400 it yeah um interesting yeah
00:06:13.280 but you're obviously gonna so you're
00:06:15.039 gonna rent a place yeah
00:06:17.199 okay
00:06:18.880 and get rid of everything except clothes
00:06:21.039 no i said like almost everything
00:06:23.199 so it's like keep a couple teslas
00:06:25.520 yeah sure yeah kind of have to
00:06:28.000 test product and stuff um
00:06:30.319 yeah those things that have sentimental
00:06:31.759 value for sure are keeping those here um
00:06:37.360 yeah so do you feel like
00:06:39.840 what's worse that could happen right
00:06:41.280 you're fine
00:06:42.240 yeah you could always buy more stuff if
00:06:43.840 you don't like it
00:06:45.039 especially yeah i mean from the money
00:06:47.039 that you sell all your stuff you could
00:06:48.240 buy new stuff
00:06:50.240 but do you you feel like
00:06:52.160 people
00:06:53.039 define you by the fact that you're
00:06:55.440 you're wealthy
00:06:56.720 and that they define you in a pejorative
00:06:58.479 way
00:06:59.280 for sure i mean not everyone but right
00:07:01.440 you know there's uh
00:07:03.520 for sure in recent like years
00:07:06.080 billionaire has become a per jar like
00:07:08.160 it's in a projective so like it's like
00:07:10.080 that's a bad thing um
00:07:12.000 which i mean i think doesn't make a lot
00:07:14.240 of sense in most cases if you've if
00:07:16.240 you're done if you basically
00:07:18.560 uh
00:07:19.919 organized a
00:07:21.199 company like see like how do how does
00:07:23.120 this wealth arise it's if you organize
00:07:26.639 people in a in a better way to produce
00:07:29.919 products and services that are better
00:07:31.840 than what existed before
00:07:33.919 and you have
00:07:35.599 some ownership in that company then that
00:07:38.479 that essentially gives you the right to
00:07:40.800 allocate more capital
00:07:42.720 so it's there's a conflation of
00:07:45.759 consumption and capital allocation
00:07:48.720 so
00:07:50.080 let me say warren buffett for example
00:07:52.560 and to get totally frank i'm not his
00:07:53.599 biggest fan but
00:07:55.280 uh
00:07:56.319 you know he does a lot of capital
00:07:58.080 allocation
00:07:59.199 um and he reads a lot of a lot of sort
00:08:01.120 of annual reports of companies and
00:08:03.440 all the accounting and it's pretty
00:08:05.199 boring really um and he's trying to
00:08:06.960 figure out is
00:08:08.800 does coke or pepsi deserve more capital
00:08:12.240 i mean that's
00:08:13.599 i mean it's kind of a boring job if you
00:08:14.960 ask me um
00:08:16.479 but
00:08:17.680 uh you know it's still a thing that's
00:08:19.360 important to figure out like which is a
00:08:21.360 company deserving of more or less
00:08:23.039 capital should that company grow or
00:08:24.960 expand is it making products and
00:08:26.560 services that are
00:08:28.000 better than others or worse and you know
00:08:31.039 should
00:08:31.840 you know
00:08:33.039 if a company is making compelling
00:08:35.200 products and services it should get more
00:08:36.880 capital and if it's not it should get
00:08:38.479 less we'll go out of business well
00:08:40.399 there's a big difference too between
00:08:42.399 someone who's making an incredible
00:08:44.959 amount of money designing and
00:08:47.200 engineering fantastic products versus
00:08:49.839 someone who's making an incredible
00:08:51.760 amount of money by
00:08:53.360 investing in companies or moving money
00:08:55.360 around in the stock market or doing
00:08:57.120 things along those lines
00:08:58.800 it's it's a different thing and to put
00:09:00.320 them all in the same category seems
00:09:02.720 it's it's very simple and as you pointed
00:09:05.360 out it's an attack vector yeah for sure
00:09:08.160 yeah i mean i think it's it's really
00:09:11.040 i i do think they're
00:09:12.880 in the in the united states especially
00:09:14.880 there's an over allocation of talent uh
00:09:17.440 in finance and law
00:09:18.959 uh basically too many smart people go
00:09:20.480 into finance and law
00:09:23.040 so
00:09:24.399 you know this is both a compliment and a
00:09:26.720 criticism
00:09:28.399 we should have of i think fewer people
00:09:31.760 doing law and fewer people doing finance
00:09:34.080 and more people making stuff
00:09:37.920 yeah yeah well that would certainly be
00:09:40.240 better for all involved if they made
00:09:42.320 better stuff yeah yeah absolutely um
00:09:45.120 and and you know manufacturing used to
00:09:46.959 be highly valued in the united states
00:09:50.080 and these days it's not it's it's often
00:09:52.399 looked down upon which i think is wrong
00:09:54.160 yeah
00:09:55.680 well i think that people are kind of
00:09:57.760 learning that
00:09:59.839 particularly because of this whole
00:10:01.600 pandemic and this relationship that we
00:10:03.839 have with china
00:10:05.200 that it there's a lot of value into
00:10:07.920 making things into making things here
00:10:10.560 yes somebody's got to do the the real
00:10:12.480 work yeah you know and um
00:10:15.360 you know
00:10:16.320 like making a car it's an honest days
00:10:18.560 that's not honest day is living that's
00:10:19.920 for sure
00:10:20.880 you know or making anything really or
00:10:23.360 providing valuable service
00:10:25.200 um like providing you know greater
00:10:27.040 entertainment good information but these
00:10:28.720 are all valuable things to do um
00:10:32.480 you know so yeah there should be more
00:10:35.200 more of it did you have a moment where
00:10:38.959 is this something that this idea of
00:10:40.320 getting rid of your material possessions
00:10:41.760 is something that built up over time or
00:10:44.000 did you have a moment of realization
00:10:45.920 where you realize that
00:10:47.760 yeah i've been thinking about it for a
00:10:48.800 while
00:10:50.399 um
00:10:51.839 you know part of it is like i
00:10:54.000 like have a bunch of houses but
00:10:57.600 i don't spend a lot of time in
00:10:59.360 most of them and
00:11:02.320 that doesn't seem like a good use of
00:11:04.480 assets like somebody could probably be
00:11:05.760 enjoying those houses and get better use
00:11:08.399 of them than me so don't you have gene
00:11:10.399 wilder's house i do that's amazing
00:11:12.480 that's awesome wow
00:11:15.760 exactly what you'd expect did you
00:11:17.200 request that the buyer not [ __ ] it up
00:11:19.120 yeah that's a requirement
00:11:20.640 oh a requirement that's that's a good
00:11:22.399 requirement yeah not in that case in
00:11:24.720 that house yeah it'll probably sell for
00:11:26.160 last but still i don't care uh he's a
00:11:28.079 legend yeah he would want his soul he'd
00:11:31.040 want his essence yeah in the building
00:11:33.839 it's and it's there that's a real quirky
00:11:36.240 quirky house yeah
00:11:37.680 what what makes you say it's there like
00:11:38.959 what do you get out of it
00:11:41.519 um
00:11:44.240 i mean all the all the cabinets are like
00:11:46.800 handmade and they're like odd shapes and
00:11:50.399 there's like doors to nowhere and
00:11:53.360 strange like
00:11:54.720 car doors and tunnels and
00:11:56.560 really odd odd paintings on the wall and
00:12:00.399 um yeah did you ever live in it it's
00:12:02.399 very quirky
00:12:03.920 i did live in it briefly yeah
00:12:06.480 but why do you buy houses like if you
00:12:08.240 own all these houses do you just get
00:12:09.920 bored and go i think i'd like to have
00:12:11.760 that
00:12:13.200 well i
00:12:14.560 you know had one house and then
00:12:17.040 the
00:12:18.240 junior wilder house right across the
00:12:19.519 road from me
00:12:20.639 from from my main house and
00:12:22.880 it was going to get it was going to get
00:12:24.480 sold and then torn down and turned into
00:12:26.880 you know be a big construction zone for
00:12:28.560 three years and
00:12:30.240 i was like well i think i'll i'll buy it
00:12:32.800 and
00:12:33.920 preserve
00:12:35.279 the spurt of gene water and
00:12:37.120 not have a giant construction zone and
00:12:39.120 then
00:12:40.480 the
00:12:41.760 you know this i started having like some
00:12:43.040 privacy issues where like people would
00:12:45.600 like less people just like come to my
00:12:47.440 house
00:12:48.320 and
00:12:49.680 you know
00:12:51.120 start climbing over the walls and stuff
00:12:53.920 i feel like man
00:12:55.760 um
00:12:56.959 so
00:12:57.839 then i saw like what a house some of the
00:12:59.760 houses around my house and then i
00:13:01.519 thought at one point well
00:13:03.519 you know it'd be cool to to build a
00:13:05.680 house so
00:13:07.519 then i
00:13:08.720 acquired some properties at the top of
00:13:11.440 samara road uh and which is
00:13:14.560 got a great view and it's like okay well
00:13:16.160 these
00:13:16.959 some bunch of sort of small older houses
00:13:19.600 they're going to get torn down anyway i
00:13:21.040 was like well you know if i collect
00:13:23.600 these like little little houses then i
00:13:25.200 can
00:13:26.079 build something
00:13:27.760 you know i don't know artistic like a
00:13:29.920 you know
00:13:31.680 dream house type of thing what's a dream
00:13:33.519 house for elon musk like some tony stark
00:13:35.760 type [ __ ] yeah definitely
00:13:38.880 yeah you gotta have the the dome that
00:13:40.959 opens up with the stealth helicopter and
00:13:43.120 that kind of thing you know yeah for
00:13:44.800 sure [ __ ] yeah yeah
00:13:46.639 um but but then i was like man
00:13:50.160 do i really want does it really make
00:13:51.600 sense for me to spend time
00:13:53.760 designing and building a house and i'd
00:13:55.440 be real
00:13:56.720 you know
00:13:57.760 get out like ocd on the little details
00:14:00.000 and the design and
00:14:02.399 or should i be allocating that time to
00:14:04.399 getting us to mars i should probably do
00:14:06.160 the latter
00:14:07.440 so
00:14:09.040 you know like what's more important mars
00:14:10.800 or a house i like mars okay
00:14:13.839 is that really how you think like that
00:14:16.240 it'd be better off
00:14:17.839 planning on a trip to mars or getting
00:14:20.079 people to mars
00:14:21.360 yeah yeah definitely i mean
00:14:24.399 you can only do so many things right
00:14:26.000 right so how you can i don't know how
00:14:27.279 you do what you do anyway i don't i
00:14:29.120 don't understand how you can run bull
00:14:30.959 with a boring company tesla
00:14:33.519 spacex all these different things you're
00:14:35.760 doing constantly i just i don't
00:14:37.279 understand i mean you explained last
00:14:39.440 time you were here how you sort of
00:14:41.199 allocate your time and and how hectic it
00:14:43.680 is and insane i still don't the the
00:14:46.000 productivity
00:14:47.360 is uh baffling just doesn't make sense
00:14:49.839 how you can get so much done
00:14:52.480 well i think i do have high productivity
00:14:54.000 but even with that there's still some
00:14:55.760 upgraded cost of time and
00:14:58.480 allocating time to
00:15:00.000 building a house even if it was a really
00:15:02.639 great house
00:15:03.760 it still is not a good use of time
00:15:06.079 relative to
00:15:07.760 developing the rockets necessary to get
00:15:10.000 us to mars and helping sell sustainable
00:15:12.800 energy
00:15:13.760 uh
00:15:14.560 spacex and tesla are by far
00:15:17.360 you know by the the
00:15:19.120 most amount of like brain cycles
00:15:21.360 um
00:15:23.040 you know boring company does not take
00:15:25.360 you know like
00:15:26.399 less than one percent of brain cycles
00:15:28.560 and um
00:15:29.920 and then this neural link which is
00:15:33.279 i don't know maybe it's like five
00:15:34.320 percent
00:15:36.240 and then five percent that's that's a
00:15:37.839 good chunk it's a good chunk yeah yeah
00:15:39.440 we were talking about that last time and
00:15:40.959 you were
00:15:41.920 trying to figure out when it was
00:15:43.519 actually going to go live when it's
00:15:45.759 actually going to be available
00:15:47.839 are you testing on people right now
00:15:50.160 no we're not testing people yet but i i
00:15:52.320 think it won't be too long i think we
00:15:54.880 may be able to
00:15:56.880 implant a neurolink in
00:16:01.040 less than a year
00:16:02.800 in a person i think
00:16:06.320 and when you do this is there any tests
00:16:09.040 that you have to do before you do
00:16:10.399 something like this to to see what
00:16:12.639 percentage of people's bodies are going
00:16:14.639 to reject these things
00:16:16.560 is it put is it there is there a
00:16:17.920 potential for rejection
00:16:20.560 it's a very low potential for rejection
00:16:23.040 i mean you can think of it like
00:16:24.880 people put in
00:16:26.800 you know heart monitors and um
00:16:30.560 you know things for epileptic seizures
00:16:32.880 and deep brain stimulation
00:16:34.959 um obviously like you know artificial
00:16:37.440 hips and right knees and that kind of
00:16:39.440 thing so the probability of i mean like
00:16:42.240 it's so it's well known like what will
00:16:43.519 cause rejection what what will not um
00:16:46.560 it's definitely harder when you've got
00:16:48.320 something that is
00:16:53.360 sort of
00:16:55.440 reading and writing neurons that's
00:16:56.959 that's generating a current pulse and
00:16:58.959 reading current pulses that's that's a
00:17:00.639 little harder
00:17:01.759 um
00:17:05.119 then then say uh passive device but it's
00:17:08.160 still you know very doable and um yeah
00:17:11.039 there there are people who have
00:17:12.799 primitive devices in in their brains
00:17:14.640 right now
00:17:15.760 what kind of devices i like deep brain
00:17:18.079 stimulation is i think for parkinson's
00:17:20.799 is
00:17:22.000 like has
00:17:23.839 really changed people's lives in a big
00:17:25.599 way
00:17:26.400 um
00:17:27.679 which is kind of remarkable because it
00:17:29.919 kind of like
00:17:30.960 zaps your brain um it's like kicking the
00:17:33.120 tv type of thing
00:17:34.799 um and you think like man kicking the tv
00:17:37.520 shouldn't work it does sometimes yeah
00:17:39.600 yeah the old old tvs it did my grandpa
00:17:42.000 used to slap the top for sure
00:17:44.240 yeah it would work sometimes yeah so
00:17:46.240 this deep right simulation uh implanted
00:17:48.240 devices in the brain that uh
00:17:50.000 have changed people's lives for the
00:17:51.440 better like fundamentally well let's
00:17:53.520 talk about what you can talk about to
00:17:55.440 what neurolink is because the last time
00:17:57.120 you were here you really couldn't
00:17:58.400 discuss it and then there was a i guess
00:18:01.200 a press release or something that sort
00:18:02.880 of outlined yeah that that happened
00:18:05.360 quite a bit after the last time you were
00:18:06.720 here so what exactly
00:18:09.039 is it how do you do what what happens if
00:18:12.000 someone
00:18:13.200 ultimately does get a neurolink
00:18:15.120 installed what will take place
00:18:18.400 well for version one of the device it
00:18:20.160 would be
00:18:22.640 it basically implanted in your skull
00:18:26.840 so but it would be
00:18:29.840 flush with your skull so you basically
00:18:33.200 uh take out a chunk of skull replace put
00:18:36.000 the neurologic device in there
00:18:37.919 um
00:18:38.880 you put the
00:18:40.400 the electrode you'd insert the electrode
00:18:42.080 threads very carefully into the the
00:18:44.559 brain
00:18:45.600 and
00:18:46.720 uh and then you
00:18:49.120 you know
00:18:50.080 stitch it up and um and you wouldn't
00:18:52.320 even know that somebody has it
00:18:54.559 and then and and so then it it can
00:18:56.960 interface basically anywhere
00:18:58.720 in any anywhere in your brain um so it
00:19:00.960 could be something that uh you know
00:19:02.640 helps cure say uh eyesight like give you
00:19:05.840 returns your eyesight even if you've
00:19:07.120 like lost your optic nerve type of thing
00:19:09.360 uh really yeah yeah absolutely hearing
00:19:12.400 obviously um
00:19:14.559 i mean pretty much anything that where
00:19:17.440 that it could in principle fix almost
00:19:19.679 anything that is wrong with the brain
00:19:21.919 and it could
00:19:24.240 restore uh
00:19:26.000 limb functionality so if you've got uh
00:19:28.880 interface into the motor cortex and then
00:19:31.600 an implant that's say
00:19:34.160 that's like a microcontroller
00:19:37.280 and near muscle groups uh you you could
00:19:39.280 then create a
00:19:40.799 sort of a neural shunt that restores
00:19:44.320 somebody who's a quadriplegic to full
00:19:46.720 functionality
00:19:48.000 like they can walk around be normal
00:19:51.039 whoa yeah so maybe slightly better
00:19:54.400 slightly better over time yes you mean
00:19:57.039 with future iterations like the you know
00:19:59.120 six million dollar man although these
00:20:00.320 days that would that doesn't matter
00:20:02.880 yeah
00:20:04.000 six billion dollars
00:20:05.760 so the
00:20:07.440 the hole would be small how big would
00:20:09.200 the hole be that you have to drill and
00:20:10.799 then replace with this piece
00:20:13.120 it's only one hole
00:20:14.880 well
00:20:15.600 um
00:20:16.880 yeah the device we're working on right
00:20:18.080 now is about
00:20:21.200 it's about an inch in diameter
00:20:23.039 um and your skull is pretty thick by the
00:20:25.120 way so skulls are mine is for sure it
00:20:27.440 might actually literally
00:20:29.280 um i mean if you're a big if you're a
00:20:31.200 big guy your skull is actually
00:20:33.360 fairly thick um
00:20:34.880 skulls like it's like seven to 14
00:20:36.960 millimeters
00:20:38.400 um so that's probably a couple inches a
00:20:40.559 half inch you know half inch thick skull
00:20:42.559 ish
00:20:43.520 so
00:20:44.559 um yeah yeah so that's a fair bit of
00:20:47.039 like our
00:20:48.400 we got quite a coconut going on here
00:20:50.000 it's not it's not like some egg shell oh
00:20:51.919 yeah i believe you um so the
00:20:54.960 yeah you basically
00:20:56.640 implant the device uh and so you would
00:20:58.720 be like a one inch square
00:21:01.760 one inch in diameter yeah like so an
00:21:03.679 inch circle like a circular yeah i think
00:21:05.919 like a like a smart watch or something
00:21:07.840 like that
00:21:09.039 okay
00:21:09.919 yeah
00:21:11.039 okay so you take this one-inch diameter
00:21:13.679 like ice fishing right you ever go ice
00:21:15.760 fishing um no but i'd like to it's great
00:21:18.320 yeah it's really fun so you basically
00:21:20.880 take an auger and you
00:21:23.200 you drill through the surface of the ice
00:21:25.679 yeah and you create a small hole and you
00:21:27.760 can dunk your line in there so this is
00:21:29.280 like that you're ice fishing on the top
00:21:30.880 of your skull and then you cork it
00:21:33.679 yeah and you replace that
00:21:36.240 say one inch diameter piece of skull
00:21:38.799 with this neural link device
00:21:41.919 and that has a battery and a and a
00:21:44.240 bluetooth and a inductive charger um and
00:21:47.520 then you
00:21:48.720 and and now then you also got to insert
00:21:50.720 the electrodes uh so the electrode is
00:21:52.880 very carefully inserted uh with our
00:21:56.080 with a robot that we developed uh that's
00:21:59.280 you know very carefully putting in the
00:22:00.480 electrodes and avoiding you know and any
00:22:02.559 veins or arteries uh so it's
00:22:05.200 you know doesn't create trauma so
00:22:07.120 through this one-inch diameter
00:22:09.919 device electrodes be inserted and they
00:22:12.559 will find their way like tiny wires
00:22:14.240 basically tiny wires
00:22:15.679 and they'll find their way to specific
00:22:17.360 areas of the brain to stimulate no you
00:22:19.840 literally put them where they're
00:22:21.440 supposed to go oh
00:22:23.200 okay yeah
00:22:24.640 how long will these wires be
00:22:26.960 uh i mean they usually go in like you
00:22:28.640 know
00:22:30.080 depending on where it is like
00:22:33.039 you know two or three millimeters
00:22:35.600 so they just find the spots yeah
00:22:38.840 wow um and then um
00:22:42.159 yeah then
00:22:43.360 you put the device in and
00:22:45.039 that that gets uh that that replaces the
00:22:48.080 little piece of skull that was taken out
00:22:50.240 uh and then you
00:22:52.159 you stitch up the hole and and um and
00:22:55.440 you just have it look like a little scar
00:22:57.280 and that's it well this would be
00:22:58.960 replaceable or reversible yes like if
00:23:00.880 someone can't take it anymore i'm too
00:23:02.799 smart i can't take it yeah you can
00:23:04.320 totally check it out and what is the
00:23:06.720 besides
00:23:08.080 restoring limb function and eyesight and
00:23:10.240 hearing which are all amazing is there
00:23:11.919 are there any cognitive benefits that
00:23:13.520 you anticipate from something like this
00:23:16.000 uh yeah i mean you could for sure um
00:23:19.679 uh
00:23:21.039 i mean basically
00:23:22.799 it's a
00:23:24.400 generalized um
00:23:28.400 sort of
00:23:29.919 uh
00:23:31.600 thing for for fixing any kind of brain
00:23:33.280 injury in in principle like if you or if
00:23:35.360 you've got like like severe epilepsy or
00:23:37.120 something like that it could it could
00:23:38.240 just it could just sort of stop the
00:23:40.400 epilepsy from occurring like it could
00:23:41.679 detect it in real time and then fire a
00:23:44.640 counter pulse and stop the epilepsy um
00:23:48.400 if um
00:23:50.320 i mean there's a whole range of brain
00:23:52.400 injuries like if somebody gets a stroke
00:23:54.159 they could lose the ability to speak
00:23:56.159 um you know that that'll stack could
00:23:58.480 also be fixed so if you've got like
00:24:00.400 stroke damage or if you lose say
00:24:03.440 you know muscle control over part of
00:24:04.960 your face or something like that i think
00:24:07.600 and then when when you get old you tend
00:24:09.200 to
00:24:10.559 if you get like you know alzheimer's or
00:24:12.960 something like that then you lose memory
00:24:15.600 and this could help you with
00:24:17.440 you know restoring your memory that kind
00:24:18.880 of thing
00:24:19.840 restoring memory and what what is
00:24:21.440 happening that's allowing it to do that
00:24:23.440 like the wires these small wires
00:24:26.320 stimulating these areas of the brain and
00:24:27.919 then is it that the areas of the brain
00:24:29.679 are they're they're losing some sort of
00:24:32.400 electrical force like what it what is
00:24:33.919 happening yeah
00:24:35.200 yeah it's it's like it's like i think
00:24:37.279 it's like a bunch of circuits and
00:24:38.720 there's some
00:24:40.559 like circuits that are broken and we can
00:24:42.799 like
00:24:44.240 uh
00:24:45.279 fix those circuits
00:24:46.799 substitute for those circuit circuits
00:24:48.559 and so a specific frequency will go
00:24:50.799 through this yeah specific in that
00:24:54.400 would
00:24:55.279 is the process figuring out how much or
00:24:58.000 how little has to be how how much
00:25:01.120 these areas of the brain have to be
00:25:02.240 juiced up
00:25:03.840 yeah i mean there's still a lot of work
00:25:05.360 to do so when i say
00:25:07.600 you know we got a shot at probably
00:25:09.120 putting it in in a person in
00:25:12.400 you know a within a year i think that's
00:25:14.880 that's what that's exactly what i mean i
00:25:16.000 think we have a chance of putting input
00:25:17.919 into one and having them
00:25:19.840 having them
00:25:20.960 be healthy and
00:25:22.320 and restoring some functionality that
00:25:24.080 they've lost the fear is that eventually
00:25:27.440 you're gonna have to cut the whole top
00:25:29.039 of someone's head off and put a new top
00:25:32.080 with a whole bunch of wires if you want
00:25:34.080 to get
00:25:35.520 you know the real turbocharged
00:25:37.919 version
00:25:39.360 the p100d
00:25:41.279 of brain stimulation
00:25:45.279 i mean ultimately if you if you want to
00:25:47.279 go with full ai symbiosis
00:25:50.559 you'll probably
00:25:52.240 want to do something like that symbiosis
00:25:54.000 is a scary word when it comes to ai
00:25:57.279 it's optional
00:25:58.080 [Laughter]
00:26:01.279 i would hope so yeah it's just i mean
00:26:04.640 once you enjoy the dr manhattan
00:26:07.039 lifestyle once you once you become a god
00:26:10.000 seems
00:26:10.960 very
00:26:11.840 very unlikely you're going to want to go
00:26:13.520 back to being stupid again
00:26:15.200 i mean you you literally could
00:26:16.720 fundamentally change the way human
00:26:18.640 beings interface with each other
00:26:20.559 yes
00:26:21.440 yes
00:26:22.400 you wouldn't need to talk
00:26:27.039 i'm so scared of that but so excited
00:26:28.960 about it at the same time is that weird
00:26:32.559 yeah i mean
00:26:33.600 the i think this is one of the paths to
00:26:36.640 um
00:26:40.000 you know i think like what
00:26:42.720 like ai is getting better and better um
00:26:45.200 so
00:26:46.320 now let's assume it's sort of like a
00:26:47.600 benign ai scenario
00:26:49.919 even in a benign scenario we're kind of
00:26:51.440 left behind
00:26:52.720 you know we're we're not we're not along
00:26:54.159 for the ride
00:26:55.360 um we're just too dumb
00:26:56.960 right
00:26:58.480 so so how do you go along for the ride
00:27:00.640 um
00:27:01.679 yeah so you can't beat them join them so
00:27:05.200 um and we're already we're already a
00:27:08.240 cyborg to some degree right because
00:27:10.080 you've got your phone you've got your
00:27:11.520 laptop glasses yeah yeah guitar
00:27:14.400 electronic devices
00:27:16.960 and
00:27:18.799 i mean today if you your phone if you if
00:27:21.200 you don't bring your phone along it's
00:27:22.399 like you have missing limb syndrome
00:27:24.000 that's like you know it feels like
00:27:25.520 something's really really missing so
00:27:28.559 we're already
00:27:29.919 partly
00:27:31.200 um
00:27:33.279 part you know partly a cyborg um or an
00:27:35.919 ai symbiote essentially
00:27:38.000 um
00:27:40.080 it's just that the data rate to the
00:27:42.159 electronics is slow
00:27:44.320 so
00:27:45.440 especially output like you're just going
00:27:47.840 with your thumbs
00:27:49.120 i don't know like
00:27:50.720 what's your data rate maybe
00:27:52.640 optimistically 100 bits per second
00:27:54.799 that's being generous
00:27:56.480 um
00:27:57.760 and now the computer can
00:27:59.679 communicate at like you know 100
00:28:02.080 terabits
00:28:03.279 you know
00:28:04.559 so
00:28:05.760 so certainly you know
00:28:07.760 gigabits are a trivial at this point
00:28:10.080 so this this is like
00:28:13.039 you know basically
00:28:14.159 your computer could do a mil do things a
00:28:16.159 million
00:28:17.360 times faster or
00:28:21.039 at a certain point it's like talk they
00:28:22.640 as like talking to a tree
00:28:25.200 okay it's boring
00:28:26.880 you talk to a tree
00:28:28.480 it's very not very entertaining
00:28:30.960 um so
00:28:33.679 um
00:28:34.960 so if you if you can
00:28:36.480 solve the the data rate
00:28:38.399 issue and your especially output but
00:28:40.480 input two then
00:28:42.320 you can
00:28:43.360 improve the
00:28:44.480 symbiosis that is already occurring
00:28:46.320 between
00:28:47.360 mana machine
00:28:49.279 so you you can improve it
00:28:51.120 in what when you said you won't have to
00:28:53.600 talk to each other anymore we used to
00:28:55.520 joke around about that i i've joked
00:28:57.200 around about that a million times in
00:28:58.399 this podcast that one day in the future
00:29:00.320 there's going to come a time where you
00:29:01.679 can read each other's minds and well
00:29:03.919 you'll be able to interface with each
00:29:05.120 other in some sort of a non-verbal
00:29:07.919 non-physical way where you will transfer
00:29:10.399 data back and forth to each other
00:29:12.240 without having to actually use your
00:29:13.840 mouth
00:29:15.600 and make noises
00:29:17.039 exactly so when you
00:29:18.960 like what happens when you when like
00:29:20.559 let's say you've got some complex idea
00:29:22.000 that you're trying to convey to somebody
00:29:23.120 else and how do you do that
00:29:25.679 well your brain spends a lot of effort
00:29:28.159 compressing
00:29:29.600 a complex concept
00:29:32.159 into words
00:29:33.760 and there's a there's a lot a lot of
00:29:35.919 loss
00:29:36.720 information loss that occurs when
00:29:38.799 compressing a complex concept into words
00:29:41.679 and then you say those words those words
00:29:43.279 are then interpreted then they're
00:29:44.240 decompressed by the person who is
00:29:46.159 listening
00:29:47.360 and they they will at best get a very
00:29:50.559 incomplete understanding of what you're
00:29:51.919 trying to convey it's very difficult to
00:29:53.840 convey a complex concept with precision
00:29:56.720 because you've got
00:29:58.159 compression
00:29:59.919 decompression
00:30:01.440 you may not even have heard all the
00:30:03.279 words correctly
00:30:05.520 and so
00:30:06.640 communication is difficult you know what
00:30:08.399 we have here is a failure to communicate
00:30:11.600 cool and luke yes and there's a great
00:30:13.919 movie yeah
00:30:15.200 there's an interpretation factor too
00:30:17.039 like you can
00:30:18.640 choose to interpret
00:30:20.840 certain series of words in in different
00:30:23.520 ways and they're dependent upon tone
00:30:26.399 dependent upon social cues
00:30:29.120 even facial expressions sarcasm there's
00:30:31.919 a lot of variables sarcasm is difficult
00:30:34.240 yes yeah and so
00:30:37.200 one of the things that
00:30:38.480 i i've said is like that there could be
00:30:41.120 potentially a universal language that's
00:30:43.679 created through computers that
00:30:45.760 particularly young kids would pick up
00:30:47.840 very quickly like my kids do tick tock
00:30:50.399 and all this jazz and i don't know what
00:30:51.919 they're doing they just know how to do
00:30:53.120 it and they know how to do it really
00:30:54.399 quickly like they learn really quickly
00:30:56.159 they show me how to edit things and yeah
00:30:58.159 it's if you taught a child from first
00:31:00.799 grade on how to use some new universal
00:31:03.519 language i mean essentially like a
00:31:05.360 rosetta stone
00:31:07.120 and
00:31:08.000 something that's done
00:31:09.519 that interprets
00:31:11.200 your thoughts and you can convey your
00:31:13.679 thoughts with no room for interpretation
00:31:16.559 with clear very clear that where you
00:31:19.840 know what a person's saying and you can
00:31:21.919 tell them
00:31:22.960 what you're saying and there's no need
00:31:25.279 for noises no need for mouth noises no
00:31:27.760 need for
00:31:28.799 these sort of accepted ways that we've
00:31:31.679 uh sort of evolved to make sounds that
00:31:35.840 we all agree
00:31:37.440 we through our cultural dictionary right
00:31:40.000 we agree or certainly we could bypass
00:31:42.000 all that yeah we can still do it for for
00:31:44.480 sentimental reasons right
00:31:46.640 like campfires
00:31:48.240 yeah yeah exactly i don't need campfires
00:31:49.919 i don't need to roast marshmallows kind
00:31:52.159 of fun right um
00:31:53.840 so yeah um
00:31:56.240 yeah i think you would in principle you
00:31:58.640 would be able to communicate
00:32:02.559 very quickly
00:32:04.159 and
00:32:05.039 with far
00:32:06.159 more precision
00:32:08.559 ideas
00:32:10.159 and
00:32:10.880 language would
00:32:13.200 i'm not sure what would happen to
00:32:14.399 language but you could probably within a
00:32:16.720 situation like this that you would be
00:32:17.840 able to just kind of like the matrix you
00:32:19.519 you want to speak a different language
00:32:20.480 in a problem right that's why it just
00:32:22.799 downloaded the program
00:32:25.840 right so
00:32:27.120 at least for the first iterations first
00:32:29.600 few iterations we'll just be able to use
00:32:31.760 like i i know that google has uh their
00:32:35.600 some of their pixel buds have the
00:32:38.080 ability to interpret languages in real
00:32:40.159 time
00:32:41.120 sure yeah you can hear it and they'll
00:32:42.880 it'll play things back to you in
00:32:44.880 whatever language you choose so to be
00:32:46.799 something along those lines
00:32:49.760 yeah for the first few iterations
00:32:52.640 well the first few iterations are i mean
00:32:54.640 what i'm talking about is like in the
00:32:55.840 limit over time you know with a lot of
00:32:58.559 development um the first few iterations
00:33:01.279 really in the first
00:33:02.559 few versions all we're going to be
00:33:03.600 trying to do is solve brain injuries um
00:33:06.640 so so it's like don't don't worry that
00:33:08.720 that's not going to sneak up on you
00:33:11.039 this this will take a while how many
00:33:12.799 years
00:33:15.279 before you don't have to talk
00:33:19.600 if the if the development
00:33:23.440 continues to accelerate then
00:33:27.840 maybe
00:33:28.880 like five years
00:33:30.480 five to ten years that's quick
00:33:32.960 that's really quick that's the best case
00:33:34.880 scenario no talking anymore in five
00:33:36.880 years best case scenario
00:33:38.480 but i'm 10 10 years more like it
00:33:41.679 i've always speculated that aliens could
00:33:43.919 potentially be us in the future because
00:33:46.480 if you look at like the size their heads
00:33:48.559 and the fact that they have very little
00:33:50.000 muscle and then they don't use their
00:33:51.840 mouth anymore they was tiny little i
00:33:53.440 mean the archetypal alien that you see
00:33:55.760 in like closing counters are the third
00:33:57.039 kind they they're like if you went from
00:34:00.640 like uh
00:34:01.799 australopithecus or ancient hominid to
00:34:05.279 us what's the difference less hair less
00:34:07.600 muscle bigger head
00:34:09.679 and then just keep going a thousand a
00:34:12.159 million whatever you or five years
00:34:14.560 whatever whatever happens when neurolink
00:34:17.119 goes on online and then we slowly start
00:34:21.199 to adapt to this new way of being
00:34:25.199 where we don't use our muscles anymore
00:34:27.280 we have this gigantic head we can talk
00:34:29.679 without words
00:34:31.760 you could also
00:34:33.760 save state
00:34:36.320 and save state save state like save your
00:34:38.800 brain state like like a saved game in a
00:34:40.719 video game whoa
00:34:42.639 like like if you want to swap from
00:34:44.879 windows 95
00:34:46.639 well
00:34:50.000 yeah i think we are windows 95 right now
00:34:52.480 yeah
00:34:53.599 from a future perspective probably um
00:34:56.560 but yeah i mean you you could
00:34:58.880 save state
00:35:00.320 um
00:35:01.440 and restore that state into a biological
00:35:03.520 being if you if you wanted to in the
00:35:05.040 future in principle it's like nothing
00:35:06.400 like from a physics standpoint that
00:35:07.599 prevents us now you'd be a little
00:35:09.280 different but then you're also a little
00:35:10.480 different when you wake up in the
00:35:11.440 morning from yesterday and you're a
00:35:12.880 little different in fact if you say like
00:35:15.040 you five years ago versus you today is
00:35:17.440 quite a big difference yes um so
00:35:20.320 you'd be substantially you i mean you'd
00:35:22.000 be you'd certainly think you're you but
00:35:23.920 the idea of saving yourself and then
00:35:27.400 transforming that into some sort of a
00:35:29.760 biological state like you can hang out
00:35:32.079 with 30 year old you
00:35:35.280 i mean the possibilities are endless
00:35:39.440 that's so weird i mean these things
00:35:41.440 think like how your phone can you can
00:35:43.119 record videos on your phone like there's
00:35:45.280 no way you could remember a video right
00:35:47.680 as accurately as your phone or a camera
00:35:49.920 you know could
00:35:51.119 so
00:35:52.240 uh
00:35:53.200 now if you've got like a you know some
00:35:55.119 some
00:35:55.920 you know version 10 hero link whatever
00:35:58.480 and far in the future
00:36:00.640 you could
00:36:01.920 you could remember you could
00:36:03.440 recall everything but just like it's a
00:36:05.200 movie
00:36:06.480 concluding all the entire sensory
00:36:08.640 experience emotions everything
00:36:10.800 everything everything
00:36:12.720 and play it back
00:36:14.320 and you can enjoy it you should edit it
00:36:16.640 edit it yeah so you can change your past
00:36:19.680 you could change what do you think was
00:36:21.520 your past yeah well so if you had like a
00:36:23.119 tremendous thing right now
00:36:25.520 could be a replayed memory it could be
00:36:28.400 yeah it may be
00:36:30.160 what's the odds of this being a replayed
00:36:32.320 memory if you had a guess
00:36:34.560 it's more than 50
00:36:37.599 there's no way to assign a probability
00:36:39.119 with accuracy here right but roughly
00:36:44.480 if you just had a just gut instinct
00:36:49.440 well i don't have a neural link in my
00:36:50.800 brain so i say right now zero percent
00:36:55.680 but at the point at which you do have a
00:36:56.960 neural link then it rises above zero
00:36:59.200 percent
00:37:02.880 the idea that we're experiencing some
00:37:05.040 sort of a preserved memory
00:37:07.280 is uh
00:37:09.440 even though it's still the same it's not
00:37:11.040 comforting
00:37:12.720 right for some reason when we people
00:37:14.720 talk about
00:37:15.920 simulation theory they talk about the
00:37:17.760 potential for this currently being a
00:37:19.520 simulation it even though your life
00:37:21.839 might be wonderful you might be in love
00:37:24.800 you might love your career you might
00:37:26.560 have great friends
00:37:28.560 but it's not comforting to know that
00:37:30.960 this experience somehow or another
00:37:32.320 doesn't exist in a material form that
00:37:33.760 you can knock
00:37:34.839 on it feels real doesn't it feels real
00:37:37.520 but but if it's not but the idea that
00:37:39.920 it's not is for some strange reason
00:37:43.359 disconcerting well yeah i'm sure it
00:37:46.400 should be disconcerting
00:37:48.160 because then if this is not real what is
00:37:50.160 right um but but the you know there's
00:37:52.640 that that old sort of um
00:37:55.440 thought experiment of like
00:37:57.280 how do you know you're not a brain in a
00:37:58.560 vet
00:37:59.839 you know i mean now here's the thing you
00:38:02.160 are a brain an event then that fat is
00:38:04.000 your skull yes and everything you see
00:38:06.880 feel here
00:38:08.240 everything all your senses are
00:38:10.320 electrical signals everything
00:38:12.560 everything
00:38:16.240 is an electrical signal to up to a brain
00:38:18.480 in a vat where the vat is called and all
00:38:20.800 your hormones all your neurotransmitters
00:38:23.359 all these things are drugs adrenaline's
00:38:25.920 a drug dopamine's a drug you're a drug
00:38:28.960 factory
00:38:30.160 you're constantly changing your state
00:38:31.680 with love and oxytocin and
00:38:34.400 and beauty sure changes your state great
00:38:37.200 music changes your state absolutely
00:38:41.599 and yet here's another
00:38:43.119 sort of interesting idea which is um
00:38:46.400 because you say like where did
00:38:48.000 consciousness arise well assuming you
00:38:50.160 believe
00:38:51.520 the
00:38:52.240 belief in physics which appears to be
00:38:54.640 true um
00:38:56.320 then you know we the universe started
00:38:58.320 off as basically quarks and leptons and
00:39:01.040 it quickly became hydrogen
00:39:03.280 and of helium lithium like basically
00:39:05.920 elements the periodic table
00:39:07.680 but it was like mostly hydrogen
00:39:09.359 basically
00:39:11.520 and then
00:39:12.960 and then over a long period of time
00:39:15.839 uh
00:39:16.720 you know 13.8 billion years later
00:39:19.680 that hydrogen became sentient
00:39:23.200 but
00:39:24.000 so where
00:39:25.599 along the way
00:39:27.520 that conju where is the consciousness
00:39:29.440 what's the line of consciousness and not
00:39:30.960 consciousness right between hydrogen and
00:39:33.119 here
00:39:34.000 right when do we call it when do we call
00:39:36.079 it consciousness i was watching a video
00:39:38.160 today that we played on a podcast
00:39:39.520 earlier of a monkey riding a motorcycle
00:39:42.000 down the street jumps off the motorcycle
00:39:44.000 and tries to steal a baby yeah i saw
00:39:45.599 that one they went apparel what is that
00:39:48.640 monkey conscious it seems like it is it
00:39:50.960 seems like it had a plan it was riding a
00:39:52.480 [ __ ] motorcycle and then jumped off
00:39:54.480 the motorcycle to try to steal a baby
00:39:57.440 seems pretty the one that just strike
00:39:59.200 baby down the street pretty far yeah
00:40:00.960 yeah
00:40:01.760 seems pretty conscious
00:40:04.160 right
00:40:05.680 there's definitely some degree of
00:40:07.119 consciousness there yeah it's not like
00:40:10.000 it's not a worm it seems to be on
00:40:11.920 another level
00:40:13.280 yeah and it's going to keep going and
00:40:15.920 that that's the real concern
00:40:19.280 when when people think about the
00:40:21.040 potential future versions of human
00:40:23.440 beings especially when you consider
00:40:25.760 symbiotic relationship to artificial
00:40:27.359 intelligence it will be unrecognizable
00:40:29.599 that one day we'll be so far removed
00:40:32.000 from what this is we'll look back on
00:40:33.599 this
00:40:34.400 the way we look back now on you know
00:40:37.599 simple
00:40:38.480 simple organisms that we evolved from
00:40:41.680 and then it won't be that far in the
00:40:43.040 future that we do have this this view
00:40:45.920 back
00:40:47.359 well i hope consciousness propagates
00:40:48.960 into the future and it gets more
00:40:50.560 more sophisticated and complex and
00:40:52.560 and that it understands the
00:40:55.599 questions to ask about the universe
00:40:58.160 do you think that's the case
00:41:00.000 as a human being as yourself you're
00:41:01.920 clearly
00:41:03.440 trying to make conscious decisions to be
00:41:05.920 a better version of you right this is
00:41:07.839 the idea of like getting rid of your
00:41:09.040 possessions and realizing that you're
00:41:11.040 trying to like i don't like this i will
00:41:13.520 try to improve this i will try to do a
00:41:16.160 better version of the way i interface
00:41:18.000 with reality
00:41:19.680 that this is always the way things are
00:41:21.760 if you're if you're moving in a
00:41:24.640 some sort of a direction where you're
00:41:26.079 trying to improve things you're always
00:41:28.000 going to move
00:41:29.200 into this new place where you look back
00:41:31.119 in the old place and go i was doing it
00:41:32.480 wrong back then
00:41:35.200 so this is an accelerated version of
00:41:36.960 that
00:41:37.680 super accelerated version of that
00:41:40.960 i mean
00:41:42.000 you don't always improve but you can
00:41:43.359 aspire to improve
00:41:44.800 you can aspire to be less wrong yeah
00:41:47.599 this is like i think a good the tools of
00:41:50.319 physics are very powerful like just
00:41:52.240 assume you're wrong and you're asking
00:41:53.440 your goals to be less wrong
00:41:55.680 i don't think you're gonna if you
00:41:57.359 succeed every day and being less wrong
00:41:58.720 but you know
00:42:00.160 if you're gonna succeed in being less
00:42:01.520 wrong
00:42:02.400 most of the time you're doing great
00:42:04.319 that's a great way of putting aspire to
00:42:06.079 be less wrong
00:42:07.839 but then when you know people look back
00:42:09.920 at nostalgia about simpler times there's
00:42:12.079 that too it's very romantic and exciting
00:42:14.560 to look back on
00:42:16.560 campfires
00:42:18.000 but you can still have a campfire yes
00:42:19.680 yeah but will you appreciate it when
00:42:21.280 you're a super nerd when you're
00:42:22.480 connected to the grid and you have some
00:42:24.400 uh skull cap in place of the top of your
00:42:27.680 head and it's interfacing with the inter
00:42:30.480 international language
00:42:32.079 that the rest of the universe now enjoys
00:42:34.720 communication with people
00:42:36.720 and we're yeah
00:42:38.240 sure i think so
00:42:40.160 yeah i like empires
00:42:41.420 [Laughter]
00:42:43.200 i'm just worried i mean uh everyone's
00:42:45.359 always scared of change but i'm scared
00:42:47.520 of this monumental change where we won't
00:42:49.920 we won't talk anymore
00:42:51.920 i mean that thing will communicate yes
00:42:53.839 but that's
00:42:55.200 there's something about
00:42:57.200 there's something about the beauty of
00:42:58.640 the crudeness of language
00:43:00.960 where when it's done eloquently it's
00:43:03.280 it's it's satisfying and
00:43:05.520 it it it
00:43:06.560 hits us in some sort of a visceral way
00:43:08.800 like ah that person nailed it i love
00:43:11.040 that they nailed it like that it's so
00:43:12.480 hard to capture
00:43:14.000 a real thought and convey it in a way
00:43:17.280 in this articulate way that makes
00:43:19.119 someone except like you read a quote a
00:43:20.800 great quote by a wise person it makes
00:43:23.040 you excited that their mind
00:43:25.280 figured something out put the words
00:43:26.800 together in a right way that makes your
00:43:28.240 brain pop like oh yes
00:43:31.040 yeah yes
00:43:32.800 it's clever compression of a concept
00:43:35.040 yeah and a feeling
00:43:36.720 but the fact that a human did it too
00:43:38.400 yeah absolutely do you think that it'll
00:43:40.319 be like electronic music like people
00:43:42.160 won't appreciate it like they appreciate
00:43:43.599 a slide guitar
00:43:46.880 i like electronic music i do too yeah
00:43:49.440 well you make it i know you liked it
00:43:51.680 yeah
00:43:52.960 yeah yeah um
00:43:55.520 yeah i mean i hope the future is more
00:43:57.599 fun and interesting and we should try to
00:43:59.599 make that way
00:44:00.880 i hope it's more fun and interesting too
00:44:02.640 yeah
00:44:03.520 i just
00:44:04.400 you know i just hope you don't lose
00:44:05.520 anything along the way
00:44:07.680 yeah we might at least little but
00:44:09.760 hopefully we'll gain more than lose yeah
00:44:11.200 that's the thing right gaining more than
00:44:12.560 we lose like something that makes us
00:44:14.000 interesting is that we're so flawed it's
00:44:16.000 not for sure right yeah
00:44:20.240 i mean you look at civilizations through
00:44:21.839 the ages um
00:44:23.200 most of them uh you know they rose and
00:44:24.800 fell yeah and uh
00:44:28.319 i do think like the
00:44:30.400 globalization
00:44:31.920 uh that that we have
00:44:35.280 at the sort of like the the meme sphere
00:44:38.079 uh is uh
00:44:39.520 there's not enough isolation between
00:44:42.000 countries
00:44:43.119 or regions
00:44:44.880 um
00:44:46.079 it's like if you get up if there's a
00:44:47.280 mind virus
00:44:49.359 that that my virus cannot infect too
00:44:51.119 much of the world
00:44:52.480 uh you know like i actually
00:44:55.520 sort of sympathize with the
00:44:56.760 anti-globalization people because it's
00:44:59.200 it's like man we don't ever want
00:45:00.880 everywhere to be the same for sure and
00:45:02.960 then we we need some kind of like mind
00:45:05.520 viral immunity
00:45:08.000 so
00:45:09.280 that that's it's a bit concerning mind
00:45:11.839 viral immunity meaning that once
00:45:14.560 something like neural link gets
00:45:15.839 established the real concern is
00:45:18.160 something that i mean you said it's
00:45:20.079 bluetooth right or some future version
00:45:22.960 of that that the idea is that something
00:45:24.880 could possibly get into it [ __ ] it up no
00:45:28.000 i'm talking about like uh somebody
00:45:29.839 there's some cockeyed concept that um
00:45:35.359 that's happened that happens right right
00:45:36.880 now
00:45:37.839 yeah
00:45:39.200 well i know there's viruses and embedded
00:45:40.960 chips right like people have
00:45:43.119 they've embedded chips and then acquired
00:45:45.040 viruses well when i'm talking about my
00:45:46.960 verse i'm talking about like a a concept
00:45:50.079 that affects people's minds
00:45:51.839 oh okay okay
00:45:54.240 like uh
00:45:55.839 cult thinking or yeah some sort of
00:45:57.599 fundamentalism yeah just
00:46:00.000 wrong-headed idea that yes goes
00:46:03.040 viral in a
00:46:04.800 in an idea sense
00:46:06.660 [Music]
00:46:08.000 well that is that is a problem too right
00:46:09.680 if someone can manipulate that
00:46:11.119 technology to make something appear
00:46:13.359 logical or rational
00:46:16.640 yeah yeah that would that be an issue
00:46:19.040 too with
00:46:20.319 this is a very have versus have not
00:46:22.640 issue right once this thing if if this
00:46:25.119 really does
00:46:26.240 i mean initially it's going to help
00:46:28.560 people with with injuries and but you
00:46:30.400 you said
00:46:31.359 ultimately it could lead to this
00:46:33.520 spectacular cognitive change yes but the
00:46:36.480 people that first get it
00:46:38.480 should have a massive advantage
00:46:41.119 over people that don't have it yet
00:46:43.680 well i mean it's the kind of thing where
00:46:45.359 your productivity would improve
00:46:47.839 i don't know dramatically maybe by a
00:46:49.440 factor of 10 with it so
00:46:52.000 you could definitely just
00:46:54.079 you know uh i don't know take out a loan
00:46:57.280 and do it and earn earn the money back
00:46:59.280 real fast
00:47:00.640 so you're super smart
00:47:02.319 well
00:47:03.119 in a capitalist society
00:47:05.680 you know you could it seems like you
00:47:07.280 could really get so far ahead that
00:47:08.880 before everybody else could afford this
00:47:11.280 thing and link up and get connected as
00:47:13.920 well you'd be so far ahead they could
00:47:15.520 never catch you
00:47:17.440 is that a concern uh
00:47:19.200 well
00:47:21.119 i think the the
00:47:23.440 it's not a super huge concern i mean
00:47:25.040 there are huge differences in cognitive
00:47:26.559 ability and and resources already yeah
00:47:29.119 um
00:47:30.240 i mean you can think of a corporation as
00:47:31.920 like a
00:47:32.880 cybernetic collective
00:47:34.480 uh that's
00:47:35.839 far smarter than an individual like i i
00:47:38.559 can personally build like a whole rocket
00:47:40.960 and and the engines and launch it and
00:47:42.559 everything that's impossible uh but
00:47:45.119 you know we have eight thousand people
00:47:46.559 with spacex and
00:47:49.119 you
00:47:49.920 might
00:47:51.680 you know piecing it out to different
00:47:53.200 people
00:47:54.400 um
00:47:55.119 and using like you know computers and
00:47:57.680 machines and stuff we can make
00:48:00.400 lots of rockets launch and all but
00:48:02.400 stuck with the space station that kind
00:48:03.920 of thing you know um so
00:48:07.359 that already exists where this
00:48:10.079 you know where there's a
00:48:11.760 corporations are vastly more capable
00:48:13.760 than an individual
00:48:16.160 um
00:48:17.119 but the the
00:48:20.720 like we should be i think less concerned
00:48:22.319 about like relative
00:48:25.200 capabilities between people and and more
00:48:27.520 like
00:48:28.640 uh
00:48:31.200 having ai be vastly
00:48:33.599 you know beyond us and
00:48:35.839 decoupled from human will
00:48:38.800 decoupled from human so this is the if
00:48:41.119 you can't beat them join them
00:48:43.440 yeah i mean so you feel like it's
00:48:45.119 inevitable like ai sentient ai is
00:48:48.400 essentially inevitable super sentient ai
00:48:50.720 yeah
00:48:52.319 like beyond a level that's difficult to
00:48:54.319 understand
00:48:56.079 and impossible to understand probably
00:48:58.880 and somehow or another
00:49:00.640 us
00:49:01.920 so it's almost like
00:49:04.319 it's a
00:49:05.599 requirement for survival to
00:49:08.400 achieve some sort of symbiotic existence
00:49:11.200 with ai
00:49:12.880 it's not a requirement it's
00:49:14.839 just um
00:49:18.000 if you if you want to be along for the
00:49:20.079 ride
00:49:22.960 then you need to do some kind of
00:49:24.400 symbiosis so the the way your brain
00:49:26.800 works right now you've got uh
00:49:29.440 kind of like the animal brain reptile
00:49:30.880 brain kind of let's
00:49:33.520 say
00:49:34.400 it's like the limbic system basically
00:49:36.559 and you've got the the cortex
00:49:38.400 um
00:49:39.359 now the brain purists will argue with
00:49:41.119 this definition but essentially you've
00:49:42.880 got
00:49:44.079 the primitive brain and you've got the
00:49:45.599 the sort of
00:49:48.640 smart brain or the brain that's capable
00:49:50.559 of planning and understanding concepts
00:49:52.160 and different difficult you know things
00:49:54.240 that a monkey can't understand um
00:49:58.079 now the
00:49:59.200 your cortex is much much smarter than
00:50:01.440 your olympic system
00:50:03.040 um
00:50:04.319 nonetheless they work together well
00:50:07.040 so i haven't met anyone who wants to
00:50:08.400 delete the olympic system or the cortex
00:50:11.119 that people are quite happy having both
00:50:13.920 um
00:50:14.880 so you can think of the
00:50:16.480 this as being
00:50:17.839 like the computer the ai is like a
00:50:20.480 a third layer a tertiary layer
00:50:23.280 so that is
00:50:24.640 like that could be symbiotic with the
00:50:26.480 cortex it'd be much smarter than the
00:50:28.000 cortex but you'd essentially have three
00:50:30.079 layers
00:50:30.960 and you actually have that right now
00:50:32.800 your phone is capable of things and your
00:50:34.800 computer is capable things that your
00:50:36.559 brain is definitely not
00:50:38.319 you know storing
00:50:40.480 your terabytes of information
00:50:42.720 perfectly
00:50:44.160 um
00:50:45.119 doing
00:50:46.400 incredible calculations that you you
00:50:48.400 know we couldn't even come close to
00:50:49.760 doing
00:50:50.640 you have that with your computer
00:50:53.040 it's just like i said the data rate is
00:50:54.559 slow the connection is weak
00:50:57.920 why is it so
00:50:59.839 disconcerting or why is it why does it
00:51:02.400 not give me comfort
00:51:04.319 to think about like when i think about a
00:51:06.079 symbiotic connection to ai i always
00:51:08.640 think of this cold
00:51:10.880 emotionless
00:51:13.359 sort of
00:51:14.400 thing that we will become
00:51:16.559 is that a bad way to look at it i don't
00:51:18.079 think that's not that's not quite that's
00:51:19.599 not how it would be
00:51:21.200 like i said you you already are yeah
00:51:23.599 symbiotic with ai or computers phones
00:51:27.040 computers laptops yeah and there's
00:51:28.720 there's quite a bit of ai going on you
00:51:30.559 know near so artificial neural nets
00:51:33.760 um increasingly
00:51:35.760 neural nets are
00:51:38.000 sort of taking over from regular
00:51:39.520 programming more and more
00:51:42.800 so
00:51:43.760 you are connected
00:51:45.280 um
00:51:47.200 you know
00:51:48.160 if you use
00:51:49.599 google voice or alexa or one of those
00:51:51.200 things it's using a neural net to decode
00:51:53.040 your speech and try to understand what
00:51:54.640 you're saying
00:51:56.079 um
00:51:57.359 you know if if you're trying to image
00:51:58.640 recognition or improve the quality of
00:52:00.960 photograph it's
00:52:02.240 it's using the neural nets the best way
00:52:04.319 to do that so
00:52:06.640 um you are already
00:52:09.280 uh
00:52:11.040 sort of a
00:52:12.079 sort of a cybernetic symbiote
00:52:14.880 it like said you
00:52:16.480 when that
00:52:17.599 it's just a question of your data rate
00:52:19.920 the the the communication speed between
00:52:22.400 your your phone and your brain is slow
00:52:26.800 when do you think you're gonna do it
00:52:29.200 how long will you wait um
00:52:33.440 like once it starts becoming available
00:52:35.040 yeah if it works i'll do it sure
00:52:37.920 right away
00:52:39.119 i mean let's make sure it works
00:52:41.760 how do we make sure it works we're
00:52:43.040 trying on prisoners like what do you do
00:52:45.119 no no you take rapists no cut holes in
00:52:48.000 your head
00:52:48.880 now like i said if somebody's got a
00:52:50.079 serious brain injury right um
00:52:52.480 and though you know people have like
00:52:53.920 very severe brain injuries um
00:52:56.240 and then and then you can fix those
00:52:58.480 those brain injuries um and
00:53:02.240 you know then you prove out that it
00:53:03.680 works and you expand envelope expand and
00:53:07.119 make more and more brain injuries
00:53:09.599 uh sold more and more um and that you
00:53:12.240 know suddenly at certain age we all are
00:53:14.240 are going to get alzheimer's we're all
00:53:15.520 going to get senile um and then you know
00:53:18.079 moms forget the names of their kids and
00:53:20.000 that kind of thing and so
00:53:21.760 you know
00:53:22.640 it's like you said okay well you know
00:53:24.319 this would allow you to
00:53:26.319 remember your names your kids and and
00:53:28.720 and have
00:53:29.920 a normal a much more normal life where
00:53:32.400 you you you're able to function much
00:53:34.800 later in life
00:53:36.000 um so i think that so essentially that
00:53:38.559 there would almost everyone would find a
00:53:40.720 need at some point if if you get old
00:53:43.040 enough to
00:53:44.240 use your neural link
00:53:47.280 and
00:53:48.160 and and then it's like okay so we can
00:53:50.400 improve the functionality and improve
00:53:52.319 the communications communication speed
00:53:54.480 so
00:53:55.359 then you
00:53:56.880 will not have to use your thumbs to
00:53:58.800 communicate with the computer
00:54:02.160 do you ever sit down extrapolate do you
00:54:03.920 ever like sit down and think about
00:54:07.280 all the different iterations of this and
00:54:09.200 what this eventually leads to
00:54:13.839 um yeah i mean i think sure think about
00:54:15.680 a lot um
00:54:17.200 there's
00:54:19.359 like i said this is not something that's
00:54:20.960 going to sneak up on you you know
00:54:22.319 there's like getting fda approval for
00:54:23.839 this stuff is not like overnight you
00:54:26.240 know um
00:54:27.920 and
00:54:30.160 this there's
00:54:31.280 i mean we probably
00:54:32.720 have to be on like version 10 or
00:54:34.000 something
00:54:35.599 before
00:54:37.280 you know
00:54:38.079 it it
00:54:39.839 would realistically be
00:54:43.119 um
00:54:44.559 you know a human ai symbiote situation
00:54:51.200 so you'll see it coming you know
00:54:53.760 you see it coming but what do you think
00:54:55.040 it's going to be
00:54:56.559 like when you sit when you're alone if
00:54:58.160 you have free time i don't know if you
00:54:59.200 have free time but if you just sit down
00:55:01.119 and think
00:55:02.160 about
00:55:03.040 this iteration the next onward keep
00:55:06.240 going
00:55:07.119 and you you drag it out with
00:55:09.040 improvements along the way
00:55:10.960 and leaps and bounds and technological
00:55:12.880 innovations and
00:55:14.640 where do you see it
00:55:18.720 what are we going to be like when 20 25
00:55:21.440 years from now what are we going to be
00:55:30.720 well assuming civilization is still
00:55:32.839 around um it's looking fragile right now
00:55:36.240 um
00:55:38.079 i think we i think we could have a
00:55:43.440 in 25 years probably something i think
00:55:45.839 like that could be a whole brain
00:55:47.040 interface
00:55:49.440 a whole brain interface
00:55:51.440 sorry pretty close to that yeah how does
00:55:53.440 how do you define what do you mean by
00:55:54.720 whole brain interface
00:55:57.119 um
00:55:59.599 like almost all the neurons
00:56:03.599 are connected to
00:56:06.559 uh
00:56:09.040 you're the sort of
00:56:10.559 ai extension of yourself
00:56:14.640 if you want ai extension of yourself
00:56:18.480 yeah
00:56:19.680 what does that mean to you like when you
00:56:21.520 say ai extension of yourself
00:56:25.760 well you like i said you already have
00:56:28.319 a computer extension of yourself in your
00:56:30.079 phone
00:56:30.960 you know and computers and stuff so and
00:56:33.599 now online it's like somebody dies
00:56:35.200 there's this like an online ghost
00:56:37.520 that they're they're still their online
00:56:39.520 stuff yeah it's alive that's a good way
00:56:42.079 to put it it is weird when you read
00:56:43.520 someone's tweets after they're dead
00:56:45.359 yeah yeah
00:56:47.119 instagram and their stories and stuff
00:56:48.960 yeah whatever facebook inside you know
00:56:50.880 like that's a great way to put it it's
00:56:52.480 like an online ghost
00:56:54.559 that's very accurate
00:56:56.839 yeah so
00:57:00.880 yeah so there's
00:57:03.280 it would just be that that more of you
00:57:05.680 would be
00:57:07.200 in the cloud i guess than in your body
00:57:10.160 more of it more of you
00:57:13.280 whoa
00:57:16.079 now when you say civilization's fragile
00:57:17.680 do you mean because of this covet 19
00:57:19.680 [ __ ] that's going on right now what's
00:57:21.520 that i've never heard of it it's this
00:57:22.559 thing yeah no it's like uh some people
00:57:24.559 just get a card other people
00:57:27.520 it gets much worse
00:57:29.440 uh sure
00:57:31.040 yeah
00:57:33.200 well
00:57:35.680 yeah
00:57:39.200 i mean this certainly has taken over the
00:57:41.760 mayan space of the world
00:57:43.680 to a degree that is quite shocking yeah
00:57:46.640 well out of nowhere that's what's crazy
00:57:48.799 it's like
00:57:49.599 you go back to november nothing now here
00:57:52.480 we are december january february march
00:57:54.640 april may six months
00:57:56.960 totally different world
00:57:58.400 so from nothing to everything's locked
00:58:00.640 down
00:58:01.680 there's so much uh conflicting
00:58:04.079 information and conflicting opinions
00:58:05.839 about how to proceed
00:58:07.440 what what has happened
00:58:09.520 you you find things where
00:58:11.680 there was a meat packing plant i believe
00:58:13.920 in missouri where
00:58:16.240 300 plus people were asymptomatic tested
00:58:20.240 positive or asymptomatic and then in
00:58:22.640 other places it just ravages entire
00:58:24.640 communities and kills people and it's
00:58:26.960 it's so weird it almost appears on the
00:58:29.920 out like if you didn't know any better
00:58:31.200 you'd be like what it seems like there's
00:58:32.480 a bunch of different viruses it doesn't
00:58:34.480 seem like it's the same thing or has a
00:58:37.040 bunch of different reactions to the
00:58:39.760 biological variety of of people
00:58:44.960 yeah um
00:58:48.000 i mean i kind of saw this whole thing
00:58:50.079 play out in china uh before it played
00:58:52.799 out in the us
00:58:54.160 so
00:58:55.520 um it's kind of like watching the same
00:58:57.599 movie again
00:58:59.119 but in english
00:59:02.960 um so
00:59:06.559 yeah um
00:59:11.760 i might i think the the the the
00:59:13.920 mortality rate is much less than what is
00:59:17.760 then what say the world health
00:59:19.440 organization said it was it's very much
00:59:21.359 module assets like probably at least
00:59:22.799 order of magnitude less well it seems to
00:59:25.839 be very deadly to very specific kinds of
00:59:28.079 people and people with specific problems
00:59:32.960 yeah i mean if you're
00:59:35.280 you can look at the mortality statistics
00:59:38.000 you know by age and whether they have
00:59:40.160 comorbid comorbidities like do they have
00:59:42.079 like basically existing conditions and
00:59:44.160 um by age um and uh
00:59:49.040 you know if you're
00:59:51.599 below 60 and and have no serious health
00:59:54.960 issues the probability of death is
00:59:56.880 extremely low it's not zero but it's
00:59:58.799 extremely low
01:00:00.960 they didn't think that this was the case
01:00:03.440 though when they first started to lock
01:00:05.440 down the country do you think that it's
01:00:07.359 a situation where once they've proceeded
01:00:10.000 in a certain way it's very difficult to
01:00:12.079 correct course
01:00:18.640 it's almost like people really wanted
01:00:20.720 a panic
01:00:21.920 that you know
01:00:23.119 quite quite crazy
01:00:25.520 but in some places a panic is deserved
01:00:27.520 right like if you're in the icu in
01:00:29.359 manhattan and people are dying left and
01:00:31.040 right and everyone's on intubators and
01:00:33.119 it's
01:00:34.720 it's it seems like
01:00:36.640 when you see all these people on
01:00:38.240 ventilators and so many of them are
01:00:40.000 dying and you see these nurses are dying
01:00:42.079 and doctors are getting sick
01:00:44.000 in some places
01:00:45.599 that
01:00:46.559 fear is justified but then in other
01:00:48.799 places
01:00:50.400 you're reading these stories about
01:00:51.839 hospitals that are
01:00:53.599 essentially half empty
01:00:55.359 they're they're having to furlough
01:00:56.720 doctors and nurses because there's no
01:00:59.200 work for them
01:01:00.960 most of the hospitals in the united
01:01:02.160 states right now half empty
01:01:04.319 in some cases they're at 30 capacity
01:01:06.880 and is this because they've decided to
01:01:09.359 forego elective procedures
01:01:11.680 and and normal things that people would
01:01:14.079 have to go to the hospital for
01:01:16.880 yes i mean
01:01:18.400 we're not talking about just
01:01:20.319 some of these elective procedures are
01:01:21.760 quite important like it's like you have
01:01:23.680 about a lot of disease yeah sure and you
01:01:25.680 need a you know triple bypass it's like
01:01:29.599 sort of elective but if you don't get it
01:01:31.359 done in time it's you're gonna die yeah
01:01:33.839 it's elective is a weird word yeah
01:01:35.280 elective it's not like hey i i want to
01:01:38.880 it's not like plastic surgery
01:01:42.400 it's more like like my my hip is i'm in
01:01:44.960 extreme pain because my my hips blown
01:01:47.040 out or my knee and i
01:01:48.720 don't want to go to the hospital i can't
01:01:50.160 go to the hospital to you know people in
01:01:52.160 extreme pain
01:01:53.440 people that need a kidney you know like
01:01:55.119 people that have like quite serious
01:01:57.200 issues that are choosing not to go out
01:01:59.119 of fear um so i think it's
01:02:01.839 it's a problem it's not good it seems
01:02:03.920 like the state of public perception is
01:02:05.920 shifting it is like people are taking
01:02:08.319 some deep breaths and relaxing and
01:02:10.400 because of the statistics of i mean and
01:02:13.839 essentially across the board it's being
01:02:15.760 recognized that it's not
01:02:18.000 as fatal as we thought it was still
01:02:20.880 dangerous still worse than the flu but
01:02:22.960 not as bad
01:02:24.319 as we thought or we feared it could be
01:02:28.160 i mean objectively the mortality is is
01:02:31.119 much lower
01:02:32.839 like
01:02:34.720 at least a factor of 10
01:02:36.640 maybe a factor of 50 lower than
01:02:38.640 initially thought
01:02:41.440 do you think that the current way we're
01:02:44.079 handling this
01:02:45.520 the social distancing the mass the
01:02:47.839 locking down is it does this make sense
01:02:50.720 is it adequate or do you think that we
01:02:53.039 should
01:02:54.240 move back to
01:02:56.480 at least closer to where we used to be
01:03:00.319 well i think proper hygiene is a good
01:03:02.240 thing no matter what you know wash your
01:03:03.920 hands and
01:03:05.200 you know and if you're
01:03:06.799 if you're coughing stay home or wear a
01:03:09.119 mask this is not good you know um like
01:03:12.079 they do that in japan that's like normal
01:03:13.839 if you're if you're ill you you wear a
01:03:16.079 face mask and you don't cough on people
01:03:18.720 i think that that would be a great thing
01:03:20.799 to to adopt in general throughout the
01:03:22.480 world
01:03:23.359 um
01:03:25.280 washing your hands is
01:03:26.880 also good well that's the speculation
01:03:28.880 why men get it more than women because
01:03:30.559 men are disgusting and we don't watch
01:03:31.920 that disgusting it's true it's true yeah
01:03:34.640 we're all my men in this room we're all
01:03:36.240 gross yeah let's go to the restroom you
01:03:37.440 can see us yes we're gross my daughter
01:03:39.599 my nine-year-old daughter yells at me
01:03:41.440 she goes did you wash your hands she
01:03:43.359 makes me go back and wash my hands hmm
01:03:45.520 she's right
01:03:46.720 nine years old if i had a nine-year-old
01:03:48.079 boy do you think he would care i
01:03:49.440 wouldn't give a [ __ ] if i wash my hands
01:03:52.400 true
01:03:53.359 um
01:03:54.559 so yeah i think that there's definitely
01:03:56.640 some silver linings here
01:03:58.079 than in improved uh
01:03:59.920 you know uh hygiene yeah and an
01:04:02.240 awareness of potential yes and i think
01:04:04.559 this has shaken up the the system uh
01:04:07.520 system is like somewhat more bond with
01:04:09.839 la la's layers of bureaucracy and i
01:04:12.000 think that we've cut through some of
01:04:13.520 that bureaucracy
01:04:14.880 uh and
01:04:16.319 if we you know at some point there
01:04:17.839 probably will be a
01:04:19.760 uh
01:04:21.119 pandemic with with a with a high
01:04:23.200 mortality rate uh
01:04:26.559 debate about like what's high but i mean
01:04:28.000 like someone that's killing a lot of 20
01:04:30.000 year olds let's say like it's
01:04:32.400 yeah if you had like ebola type of
01:04:34.319 mortality spanish flu something that uh
01:04:36.799 tax immune systems of healthy people
01:04:38.559 yeah yeah um yeah but it's a
01:04:42.559 yeah like like killing large numbers of
01:04:45.440 young healthy people that that's
01:04:47.599 you know
01:04:48.799 define that as like uh
01:04:50.960 uh
01:04:52.000 high mortality then that this is at
01:04:54.400 least practice for something like that
01:04:56.720 um and i think there's
01:04:58.400 this you know
01:04:59.599 given it's just a matter of time that
01:05:01.280 there will be eventually some
01:05:03.359 some such pandemic
01:05:05.280 do you think that in a sense the one
01:05:08.000 good thing that we might get out of this
01:05:09.440 is the realization that this is a
01:05:10.960 potential reality that we we got lucky
01:05:13.760 in this sense i mean in people that
01:05:15.680 didn't get lucky and died of course i'm
01:05:17.440 not disrespecting their death and their
01:05:19.280 loss but i'm saying overall as a as a
01:05:21.920 culture as a community as a human race
01:05:23.680 as a community
01:05:24.880 this is not as bad as it could have been
01:05:26.640 this is a good dry run for us to
01:05:28.799 appreciate
01:05:30.079 that we need far more resources
01:05:33.039 dedicated towards the the understanding
01:05:37.039 these diseases
01:05:38.400 what to do in the case of pandemic and
01:05:40.960 much more
01:05:42.160 money that goes to funding
01:05:44.319 treatments and and some preventative
01:05:46.960 measures
01:05:48.559 yeah absolutely um
01:05:50.640 and i think i think there's a
01:05:52.880 good chance it's highly likely i think
01:05:54.720 coming out of this that
01:05:56.480 we will develop uh vaccines that we
01:05:59.520 didn't have before
01:06:01.119 uh for uh
01:06:03.280 quran viruses and other other viruses um
01:06:06.319 and and possibly cures uh for for these
01:06:09.680 and our understanding of
01:06:11.920 uh viruses of this nature has improved
01:06:13.839 dramatically because of the attention
01:06:15.280 that it's received
01:06:17.440 so
01:06:18.960 there's definitely some you know a lot
01:06:20.559 of silver linings here um
01:06:23.520 and potentially if we act correctly
01:06:26.559 yeah yeah yeah there's uh i think
01:06:29.680 there will be some amounts of lighting
01:06:31.200 here no matter what um hopefully it can
01:06:33.119 be more professive lighting than less
01:06:35.440 yeah
01:06:36.480 um
01:06:38.480 so yeah this is this is uh
01:06:41.280 it's like kind of like a practice run
01:06:42.640 for something that had that that had a
01:06:45.119 potential that might in the future have
01:06:46.960 a serious uh like a really high
01:06:49.039 mortality rate that
01:06:50.799 and we
01:06:52.559 kind of got to go through this with
01:06:54.400 without without it being something that
01:06:56.079 kills you know vast numbers of
01:06:58.400 young healthy people
01:06:59.680 yeah
01:07:00.880 when you made a series of tweets
01:07:03.039 recently uh you know uh i don't remember
01:07:05.440 the exact wording but essentially you
01:07:06.799 were saying free america now like let's
01:07:09.039 think about that is it thank you
01:07:11.760 but uh the the you know what was the
01:07:14.960 how much do you pay attention to the
01:07:16.559 response to that stuff and what was the
01:07:18.240 response like
01:07:19.680 did anybody go hey elon what the [ __ ]
01:07:21.200 you doing did anybody pull you aside
01:07:24.000 who does that who gets to do that to you
01:07:28.319 well i mean i certainly get that there's
01:07:30.640 no shortage of negative feedback on
01:07:32.400 twitter you know oh yeah twitter
01:07:35.200 yeah but i don't read that do you read
01:07:37.280 it warzone you do sometimes though right
01:07:39.440 you do read it yeah i mean
01:07:41.599 scroll through the comments like as a
01:07:43.680 meme warzone
01:07:45.359 yeah i mean people knife you're good
01:07:48.880 it's something i i enjoy about
01:07:51.680 that just the
01:07:53.440 there's a
01:07:55.200 something about the
01:07:58.559 the freedom of expression that comes
01:08:00.880 from all these people that do attack you
01:08:03.440 it's like well they if there was no
01:08:05.359 vulnerability whatsoever they wouldn't
01:08:07.280 attack you and
01:08:08.880 it's like there's something about these
01:08:12.640 millions and millions of perspectives
01:08:15.520 that you you have to
01:08:17.839 you have to appreciate
01:08:19.439 even if it comes your way even if the
01:08:21.439 [ __ ] storm hits you in the face sure you
01:08:23.679 gotta appreciate wow how amazing is it
01:08:26.000 that all these people do have the
01:08:27.520 ability to express themselves
01:08:29.520 you don't don't necessarily want to be
01:08:30.960 there when the [ __ ] hits you sure you
01:08:33.198 might want to get out of the way in
01:08:34.399 anticipation of the [ __ ] storm but the
01:08:36.000 fact that so many people have the
01:08:38.158 ability to reach out and i think it's in
01:08:40.158 a lot of ways it's uh i don't wanna say
01:08:42.479 a misused resource but it's like giving
01:08:46.000 monkeys guns they just start
01:08:48.799 they start gunning down
01:08:50.479 things that in front of them without any
01:08:51.920 realization of what they're doing they
01:08:54.238 have a rock they see a window they throw
01:08:56.158 it whoa look at that i got elon madd
01:08:59.198 look at that this guy got mad at me this
01:09:01.359 this i i [ __ ] took this person down
01:09:03.520 on twitter i got this lady fired oh the
01:09:06.799 [ __ ] business is going under because
01:09:08.399 of twitter wars it seems like there's
01:09:11.040 something about it that's this
01:09:13.600 newfound
01:09:14.960 thing
01:09:16.080 that uh i want to say abuse but just i
01:09:19.198 want to say that it's almost like you
01:09:21.198 know you hit the button and things blow
01:09:22.799 up you're like wow
01:09:24.479 this is what else can we blow up
01:09:28.080 sure
01:09:28.880 um
01:09:31.600 i mean i've been in the twitter war zone
01:09:32.960 for for a while here so put your war
01:09:34.719 zone
01:09:36.238 you know take it takes a lot to phase me
01:09:38.560 at this point yeah that's good too right
01:09:40.880 like you develop a thick skin
01:09:43.920 yeah you can't take it personally these
01:09:45.839 people don't like actually know you you
01:09:47.439 know like yeah
01:09:49.279 it's just like
01:09:50.560 you know so it's like if you're if
01:09:51.920 you're fighting a war
01:09:53.679 and there's like some opposing soldier
01:09:55.679 that that shoots shoots at you it's not
01:09:58.320 like they hate you they don't even know
01:09:59.920 you right yeah yeah so
01:10:02.560 just think of it like that like they're
01:10:03.840 firing bullets or whatever um but they
01:10:06.239 don't know you so don't take it
01:10:07.600 personally there's something interesting
01:10:09.280 about it too it's like uh like when you
01:10:11.440 write something in you know 280
01:10:14.080 characters and they write something into
01:10:15.679 it it's such a crude way
01:10:17.840 it's like you know someone's saying
01:10:19.360 sending opposing smoke signals that
01:10:21.520 refute your smoke signals it's like
01:10:23.920 it's so crude
01:10:26.000 and especially when you're talking about
01:10:27.760 something like neural link he's talking
01:10:29.600 about some future potential where you're
01:10:32.000 going to be able to express pure
01:10:33.840 thoughts that get get conveyed through
01:10:36.640 some sort of a universal language with
01:10:39.199 no ambiguity whatsoever
01:10:41.520 versus
01:10:43.360 you know tweets
01:10:45.360 well there'll always be some ambiguity
01:10:46.800 but yeah
01:10:47.920 tweets are
01:10:49.840 it's hard um
01:10:51.440 like the maybe there should be like a
01:10:52.960 sarcasm flag or something you know right
01:10:54.719 right um or i'm not you know just
01:10:57.199 kidding or whatever you know like don't
01:10:58.560 you know it seems like it would take
01:11:00.560 away some of the fun from people that
01:11:02.080 know it's sarcasm like if everybody knew
01:11:04.560 that the onion wasn't real if you sent
01:11:06.480 people articles yeah is something about
01:11:09.600 someone getting angry at an onion
01:11:11.440 article wow that's amazing you know what
01:11:13.360 i mean where they don't realize what it
01:11:15.040 is there's something fun about that for
01:11:16.719 everybody else
01:11:18.159 uh yeah
01:11:19.840 i know it's pretty great
01:11:21.520 it might be the best news source
01:11:23.600 do you know who titania mcgrath is
01:11:26.480 hilario it's uh andrew boyle he's a uh a
01:11:30.159 british fellow a brilliant guy who's
01:11:32.400 been on the podcast before and he has
01:11:33.920 this uh fictional character this uh
01:11:36.640 pseudonym titania mcgrath who's like
01:11:38.880 this all the ultimate social justice
01:11:40.640 warrior
01:11:42.800 is this like
01:11:43.920 like a female avatar
01:11:45.679 a female avatar that's actually a
01:11:47.440 computer conglomeration of a bunch of
01:11:49.360 faces okay it's not really one person so
01:11:51.600 one person can't be a victim and be
01:11:53.360 angry he's sort of combined these faces
01:11:55.760 to make this one perfect social justice
01:11:57.440 more okay but the thing like i
01:11:59.840 recognized it early on before i met him
01:12:02.480 sure that this was parody this is this
01:12:05.280 was just fun
01:12:06.800 and then i love reading the people that
01:12:09.840 don't recognize that they get angry sure
01:12:12.800 and then they're really really like
01:12:14.800 there's a lot of people that just get
01:12:16.239 really furious sure about some of
01:12:19.199 some fun to that
01:12:21.040 there's some fun to the not picking up
01:12:24.239 on the the the true nature of the signal
01:12:28.800 i find twitter quite engaging
01:12:31.280 how do you have the time
01:12:33.760 um well i mean it's like
01:12:36.880 five minutes every couple hours type of
01:12:38.560 thing it's not like i'm sitting on an
01:12:40.000 old day but even five minutes every
01:12:41.920 couple hours if those are bad five
01:12:44.000 minutes they might be bouncing around
01:12:45.440 your head for the next 30.
01:12:48.239 yeah you have to
01:12:50.719 you know like i said
01:12:52.000 take a certain amount of
01:12:53.360 distance from you read this and you're
01:12:54.800 like okay it's bullets being fired by an
01:12:57.120 opposing army
01:12:59.040 you know don't like it
01:13:00.719 it's not like they they like so it's not
01:13:02.239 like they know you it's like
01:13:04.000 don't take it personally um did you feel
01:13:06.080 the same way when when cnn
01:13:08.320 had that stupid [ __ ] about ventilators
01:13:10.239 with you
01:13:11.120 i i found that
01:13:12.560 both confusing and the the the
01:13:15.360 yeah that was annoying it was annoying
01:13:18.000 but what is also annoying as a person
01:13:19.920 who reads
01:13:21.280 cnn and wants to think of them as a
01:13:23.840 responsible conveyor of the facts
01:13:26.320 i would like to think that
01:13:28.400 yeah
01:13:30.159 i don't think cnn is that i think he
01:13:32.080 used to be he used to be yeah
01:13:34.480 um like what do you think's the the best
01:13:36.560 source of just like information out
01:13:38.400 there that's a good question you know
01:13:39.840 like
01:13:40.640 let's say you're just like
01:13:42.159 average citizen trying to just get the
01:13:44.159 facts you know figure out what's going
01:13:46.000 on like you know how to
01:13:48.159 live your life and
01:13:50.159 you know just looking for
01:13:51.679 what what's going on in the world that
01:13:53.760 it's hard to find something that that
01:13:55.440 isn't
01:13:57.600 you know
01:13:59.600 that's that that's good yeah you know uh
01:14:02.320 that you know not not trying to push
01:14:04.640 some partisan angle not trying to not
01:14:07.440 not sort of doing sloppy reporting and
01:14:09.520 and just aiming for the most number of
01:14:11.679 clicks and trying to maximize ad dollars
01:14:13.520 and that kind of thing yeah
01:14:15.360 you're just trying to figure out what's
01:14:16.400 going on it's like
01:14:17.679 i'm hard pressed
01:14:20.159 where do you go i don't know i don't
01:14:22.159 think there's any pure form
01:14:24.400 my favorite
01:14:26.480 places are the new york times and the la
01:14:28.560 times and i don't trust them 100 percent
01:14:31.679 you know because also there's
01:14:33.440 individuals that are writing these
01:14:35.199 stories
01:14:36.080 exactly and that's seems to be the
01:14:37.679 problems these individual biases and
01:14:39.760 these individual
01:14:41.520 there's
01:14:42.480 purposely distorted perceptions and then
01:14:44.719 there's ignorantly
01:14:46.800 reported facts and there's so many
01:14:49.440 variables and you got to put everything
01:14:51.120 through this filter of where is this
01:14:53.040 person coming from do they have
01:14:54.320 political biases do they have social
01:14:56.719 biases do they are they
01:14:59.040 are they upset because of their own
01:15:00.800 shortcomings and they are they
01:15:02.400 projecting this into the story sure it's
01:15:04.719 so hard
01:15:06.320 yeah i think like maybe just trying to
01:15:07.440 find individual reporters that you think
01:15:09.360 are good and yeah kind of falling down
01:15:11.600 as opposed to the publication i go with
01:15:13.520 whatever matt taibbi says
01:15:15.600 okay i trust him more than anybody all
01:15:17.280 right
01:15:18.000 matt taib he's onto something i just
01:15:20.320 he's as far as investigative reporters
01:15:22.640 in particular the way he reported the
01:15:24.640 savings and loan crisis the way he
01:15:26.719 reports everything i just i just listen
01:15:28.480 to him above
01:15:30.320 most
01:15:31.280 above mo he's my go-to guy all right
01:15:33.199 i'll check it out uh it's rolling
01:15:35.040 stone's articles or his stuff on the
01:15:36.640 savings alone crisis just like what in
01:15:38.640 the [ __ ]
01:15:39.679 and you know and he wasn't you know he's
01:15:41.280 not an economist by any stretch of the
01:15:42.640 imagination so he had to really sort of
01:15:44.480 deeply embed himself in that world to
01:15:46.800 try to understand it and to be able to
01:15:48.800 report on it
01:15:50.159 and was also with a humorous flair
01:15:52.480 for now that's nice yeah um
01:15:56.239 yeah
01:15:57.920 but it's not that many of them there's
01:16:00.080 it's hard and not a location where like
01:16:03.199 we are no [ __ ] that's right you know
01:16:05.199 we are no bullshit.com like the one
01:16:07.600 place where you can say this is what we
01:16:10.000 know this is what we don't know this is
01:16:11.440 what we think not
01:16:13.440 this person's wrong and here's why like
01:16:15.440 oh
01:16:16.400 god damn it you know i can't you you
01:16:19.120 don't know there's a lot of stuff that
01:16:21.120 is open to interpretation
01:16:23.280 yeah
01:16:24.000 this this particular coronavirus issue
01:16:26.400 that we're dealing with right now seems
01:16:27.840 to be a great
01:16:30.159 illuminator of that very fact is that
01:16:33.199 there's so much
01:16:34.880 data and there's this so there's so much
01:16:37.280 that's open to interpret there's so many
01:16:38.960 thing because it's all happening in real
01:16:40.880 time right and like particularly right
01:16:42.880 now in california we're in stage two
01:16:45.360 tomorrow or friday two days from now
01:16:47.520 stage two retail stores opening up
01:16:49.760 things are changing like when no one
01:16:51.920 knows the correct
01:16:54.080 process that needs to take place to save
01:16:56.560 the most amount of lives but yet ensure
01:16:59.120 that our
01:17:00.400 our culture and that our
01:17:02.400 our our economy survives
01:17:05.199 it's a lot of speculation and guessing
01:17:07.520 but if you go to certain places they'll
01:17:09.360 tell you we know why and we know this
01:17:12.159 and we know uh
01:17:13.840 it's hard
01:17:15.679 yeah i mean
01:17:17.360 i
01:17:18.880 in general i think that's like we should
01:17:20.719 be concerned about
01:17:22.320 um anything that's a massive
01:17:23.920 infringement on our civil civil
01:17:25.520 liberties yes you know so it's like
01:17:28.400 you got to put a lot of weight on that
01:17:30.159 um
01:17:31.040 you know people
01:17:32.080 a lot of people died to
01:17:33.840 you know win independence with the
01:17:35.679 country and and fight for the democracy
01:17:37.920 that we have and uh
01:17:40.159 you know we should treasure that and not
01:17:42.480 and not give up our liberties too easily
01:17:44.480 i think we've we
01:17:45.679 i mean i think we probably did that
01:17:47.120 actually
01:17:48.320 well i like what you said when you said
01:17:50.400 that it should be a choice
01:17:52.960 and that
01:17:54.480 to require people to stay home require
01:17:57.600 people to not go to work require and to
01:18:00.560 to arrest people for trying to make a
01:18:03.040 living this all seems wrong and i think
01:18:05.760 it's a wrong approach it's a it's uh
01:18:08.239 you're you're
01:18:09.280 it's an infantilization
01:18:11.199 of the society
01:18:13.199 that daddy's going to tell you what to
01:18:14.560 do fundamentally a violation of the
01:18:16.400 constitution yeah freedom of assembly
01:18:18.640 and you know it's just
01:18:21.360 i mean i don't think these things stand
01:18:22.560 up in court really they're arresting
01:18:24.880 people for protesting yeah yeah because
01:18:27.199 they're protesting and violating social
01:18:29.440 distancing and these mandates that tell
01:18:31.360 people that they have to stay home
01:18:33.120 yeah these these are these would
01:18:34.880 definitely not stand up uh you know if
01:18:37.280 the
01:18:38.320 supreme court here i mean it's obviously
01:18:40.480 a complete violation right yeah yeah and
01:18:42.480 again this is not
01:18:43.920 in any way um disrespecting the people
01:18:46.719 who have died from this disease that's
01:18:48.560 certainly a real thing to think of
01:18:50.960 yeah i mean it it it just should be if
01:18:53.679 if you're if you're at risk you should
01:18:55.199 not be compelled to leave your house
01:18:57.199 right um or leave a place of safety but
01:18:59.199 you should also not be
01:19:00.880 uh if you're not at risk or if you are
01:19:03.360 at risk and you wish to take a risk with
01:19:05.199 your life you should have the right to
01:19:06.960 do that and it seems like at this point
01:19:09.360 in time particularly
01:19:10.960 our resources would be best served
01:19:13.600 protecting the people that are at risk
01:19:16.159 versus penalizing the people that are
01:19:18.159 not at high risk for living their life
01:19:20.640 the way they did particularly having a
01:19:22.560 career and and making a living and
01:19:24.560 feeding your family
01:19:26.239 paying your bills keeping your store
01:19:27.679 open keeping your restaurant open
01:19:30.000 yes
01:19:31.520 i mean there's there's a strong a strong
01:19:33.360 downside to this yeah
01:19:35.679 so
01:19:37.840 yeah i just believe like you know if
01:19:39.280 this is a free country you should be
01:19:41.679 you know a lot allowed to do
01:19:44.000 you know what you want as long as it
01:19:45.199 does not endanger others but that's the
01:19:47.360 thing right people this is the argument
01:19:49.120 they will bring up like you are
01:19:50.719 endangering others you should stay home
01:19:53.199 for the people that that
01:19:55.120 you even if you're fine even if you know
01:19:57.360 you're gonna be okay there's certain
01:19:58.719 people that will not be okay because of
01:20:00.400 your actions they might get exposed to
01:20:02.960 this thing that we don't have a vaccine
01:20:04.880 for
01:20:05.760 we don't have universally accepted
01:20:07.840 treatment for
01:20:09.040 and then we need to ca this is there's
01:20:11.040 two arguments right the one argument is
01:20:13.600 we need to keep going protect the weak
01:20:15.920 protect the sick but let's open up the
01:20:17.600 economy the other argument is stop
01:20:20.080 placing money over human lives
01:20:22.719 and let's shelter in place until we come
01:20:25.760 up with some sort of a decision and
01:20:27.600 let's figure out some way to develop
01:20:30.080 some sort of universal income universal
01:20:32.320 basic income plan or something like that
01:20:34.159 to feed people during the during this
01:20:36.639 time
01:20:38.000 when we make this transition i think
01:20:39.440 there's a
01:20:41.600 yeah um
01:20:43.280 as i said right
01:20:45.360 yeah my opinion is if if somebody wants
01:20:47.280 to stay home they should stay home and
01:20:49.120 say something doesn't want to stay home
01:20:50.239 they should not be compelled to stay
01:20:51.360 home
01:20:52.639 that's my opinion do you think
01:20:54.719 if somebody doesn't like that well
01:20:56.239 that's my opinion
01:20:57.520 um
01:20:58.400 so
01:20:59.199 the now yeah um
01:21:01.600 the the this notion though that uh you
01:21:04.000 know you can just sort of send checks
01:21:05.280 out everybody and and things will be
01:21:06.719 fine it's not true obviously um the
01:21:09.920 there's some people have this absurd
01:21:12.480 like a
01:21:13.760 view that the economy is like some magic
01:21:16.480 horn of plenty
01:21:18.159 like it it just makes stuff
01:21:21.040 stuff you know whatever it just there's
01:21:22.960 a magic quarter plenty and the goods and
01:21:25.280 services they just come from this magic
01:21:26.800 corner plenty and then if um like if
01:21:29.840 somebody has more stuff than somebody
01:21:31.199 else's because they took more from this
01:21:32.560 magic corner plenty now let me uh just
01:21:35.360 break it to uh
01:21:37.360 the fools out there
01:21:38.800 if you don't make stuff
01:21:40.880 there's no stuff
01:21:45.120 yeah
01:21:45.920 so
01:21:47.199 if you don't make the food if you don't
01:21:49.520 process the food you know transport the
01:21:51.440 food
01:21:53.280 and what the
01:21:54.719 whether you know medical treatment
01:21:57.920 getting getting your teeth fixed
01:22:01.840 there's no stuff
01:22:04.719 i become detached from reality
01:22:09.040 you can't just
01:22:10.400 legislate
01:22:11.840 money and solve these things if you
01:22:13.760 don't make stuff there is no stuff
01:22:18.000 obviously
01:22:20.239 we'll run out of the stores
01:22:22.400 run out of the you know
01:22:25.920 it's the whole the machine just grinds
01:22:27.840 to a halt
01:22:28.960 but the the initial thought on this
01:22:31.360 virus the real fear was that this was
01:22:33.840 going to kill
01:22:34.960 hundreds of thousands if not millions of
01:22:37.199 people instantaneously
01:22:39.600 in this country it was going to do it
01:22:41.120 very quickly if we didn't hunker down if
01:22:43.760 we didn't shelter in place if we didn't
01:22:45.920 quarantine ourselves or lock down
01:22:48.080 do you think that the initial thought
01:22:50.320 was a good idea based on the perception
01:22:52.960 that this was going to be far more
01:22:54.480 deadly than it turned out to be
01:23:00.239 maybe i think
01:23:01.679 briefly briefly briefly
01:23:05.199 but uh i think if you know any any kind
01:23:07.760 of like sensible examination of what
01:23:09.440 happened in china would lead to the
01:23:10.880 conclusion that that is obviously not
01:23:12.080 going to occur uh this this virus
01:23:14.320 originated in wuhan there's like i don't
01:23:16.239 know hundred thousand people a day
01:23:17.360 leaving on uh so it that that it it uh
01:23:21.840 it went everywhere very fast
01:23:25.040 through throughout china throughout the
01:23:26.480 rest of the world
01:23:27.760 um and
01:23:31.120 the fatality rate was
01:23:33.280 was low don't you think though it's
01:23:34.880 difficult to appreciate it's it's it's
01:23:37.360 difficult to filter
01:23:39.440 what the information is coming out of
01:23:40.800 china
01:23:41.920 to accurately
01:23:44.480 really get a real true representation of
01:23:46.639 what happened the the propaganda machine
01:23:48.960 is very strong sure what
01:23:51.600 the world health organization appears to
01:23:53.520 have been complicit
01:23:55.040 with a lot of their propaganda
01:23:57.760 the thing is that
01:23:59.199 american companies have massive
01:24:01.840 supply chains in china like tesla for
01:24:04.239 example we have hundreds of suppliers
01:24:06.320 like tier one two three four suppliers
01:24:08.719 throughout throughout china so
01:24:11.280 we know if they are able to make stuff
01:24:12.800 or not
01:24:14.080 we know if they if they have issues or
01:24:15.679 not
01:24:16.639 then they they're china is back back at
01:24:18.880 full steam
01:24:20.800 um and until
01:24:22.480 many
01:24:24.320 uh pretty much every u.s company has
01:24:27.040 some significant number of flies in
01:24:28.480 china so you know you know if they're
01:24:30.159 able to
01:24:31.440 you know
01:24:33.920 provide things or not or if there's
01:24:36.800 you know
01:24:38.159 high mortality rate
01:24:39.920 tesla has seven thousand people in china
01:24:42.080 so
01:24:44.000 zero people died
01:24:45.360 um zero
01:24:48.239 okay so that that's a real statistic
01:24:50.480 that's coming from yeah yeah you know
01:24:52.560 those people yeah we literally we're in
01:24:55.199 payroll do you think there's a danger of
01:24:56.960 this
01:24:59.360 same folks are there yeah
01:25:01.360 do you think there's a danger of
01:25:02.800 politicizing this whereas becomes like
01:25:04.960 opening up the country's uh donald
01:25:06.560 trump's
01:25:07.520 it's his goal it's his and then
01:25:10.239 anything he does is sort of uh there's
01:25:12.560 there's people that are going to oppose
01:25:14.320 it and come up with some reasons why
01:25:16.080 he's wrong particularly in this climate
01:25:17.679 whereas as we're leading up november
01:25:20.080 and you know the the 2020 elections do
01:25:23.120 you think that this is a real danger in
01:25:25.120 terms of uh public's perception that
01:25:27.679 trump wants to open it up so they
01:25:29.440 knee-jerk
01:25:30.880 oppose it because they oppose trump
01:25:34.239 i i think there has been some
01:25:36.960 politician this has been
01:25:38.840 politicized
01:25:40.480 you know
01:25:41.920 in both directions really so it's
01:25:44.880 um
01:25:45.679 which is
01:25:47.840 not great
01:25:53.280 yeah but like i said separate apart from
01:25:54.880 that i think there's the question of
01:25:56.000 like
01:25:56.880 you know where do several civil
01:25:58.239 liberties fit in this picture you know
01:26:00.320 yeah and uh what what what can the
01:26:02.639 government make you do what can they
01:26:04.159 make you not do and what you know what's
01:26:06.239 what's okay right um
01:26:09.199 and uh
01:26:13.199 yeah i think we went too far
01:26:15.679 do you think it's one of those things
01:26:16.880 where once
01:26:18.480 we've gone in a certain direction it's
01:26:20.560 very difficult to make a correction
01:26:23.040 make a an adjustment to to realize like
01:26:25.760 okay we thought it was one thing it's
01:26:28.159 not it's not good but it's not what we
01:26:30.159 thought it was going to be it's not what
01:26:31.199 we feared so let's let's back up and
01:26:34.560 reconsider let's do this publicly and
01:26:36.800 say we were acting
01:26:38.560 based on the information that we had
01:26:40.320 initially that information appears to be
01:26:42.719 faulty
01:26:43.920 and uh here's how we move forward while
01:26:46.400 protecting civil liberties while
01:26:48.800 protecting what essentially this country
01:26:51.040 was founded on which is a very agreed
01:26:54.159 upon amount of freedom yeah that we
01:26:55.920 respect and appreciate
01:26:58.080 absolutely
01:26:59.120 well i think we're we're rapidly moving
01:27:00.960 towards opening up the country um it's
01:27:03.440 going to happen extremely fast over the
01:27:05.440 next few weeks
01:27:08.080 so
01:27:09.520 yeah
01:27:12.800 something that would be helpful just add
01:27:14.239 from an informational level is
01:27:17.040 um when reporting uh
01:27:20.080 sort of
01:27:21.120 covet cases to separate out
01:27:23.679 diagnosed with covert versus uh had
01:27:26.239 covert like symptoms yes
01:27:29.199 because the list of symptoms that could
01:27:31.760 be covered at this point is like a mile
01:27:33.440 long so it's like a hard to
01:27:36.239 if you're ill at all it's like it could
01:27:37.840 be covered so
01:27:39.280 just just to give people better
01:27:40.639 information
01:27:41.840 definitely diagnosed with covert or
01:27:44.800 had covered like symptoms we're
01:27:46.239 conflating those two
01:27:48.159 so that one that it looks bigger than it
01:27:50.000 is
01:27:50.639 then uh if somebody dies is
01:27:53.440 was covert a a primary cause
01:27:56.400 of the death or not
01:27:58.800 uh i mean if i mean if somebody has kova
01:28:01.040 gets eaten by a shark
01:28:03.120 we find their arm their arm has covered
01:28:07.440 it's gonna get recorded as a cover death
01:28:09.760 is that real
01:28:11.600 basically not that bad but heart attacks
01:28:14.000 strokes you get hit by a bug cancer
01:28:17.040 if you if you get hit by a bus
01:28:18.960 go to the go to the hospital and die and
01:28:21.760 then find that you have covered you will
01:28:23.199 be recorded as a cover death why would
01:28:24.639 they do that though
01:28:27.600 well right now the so
01:28:30.000 you know the road is hell is the rotel
01:28:32.080 is paid with good intentions i mean he's
01:28:33.280 mostly paid with bad intentions but
01:28:34.880 there's you know some good intentions
01:28:36.560 saving stones in there too
01:28:38.480 um
01:28:39.360 and the
01:28:40.400 the the stimulus bill that was intended
01:28:42.400 to help uh
01:28:44.880 with the hospitals that were being
01:28:46.080 overrun with with with code patients uh
01:28:48.239 created an incentive to
01:28:51.280 record something as covet that is
01:28:55.120 difficult to
01:28:56.719 say no to especially if your hospital is
01:28:58.560 going bankrupt for lack of other
01:28:59.920 patients
01:29:00.960 so the hospitals are in a bind right now
01:29:03.760 there's a bunch of hospitals are they're
01:29:05.360 following doctors as you were mentioning
01:29:06.880 they're
01:29:08.000 you know they're your is half full
01:29:09.600 you're
01:29:10.639 it's hard hard to make ends meet
01:29:12.480 so now you've got like
01:29:14.000 you know if i just check this box i get
01:29:16.000 eight thousand dollars
01:29:17.760 put on a ventilator for five minutes i
01:29:19.199 get thirty nine thousand dollars
01:29:21.840 back or or i to fire some doctors so
01:29:24.480 what's the what's this this is a tough
01:29:26.320 moral quandary
01:29:27.760 it's like what you can do
01:29:32.080 that's the situation we have
01:29:33.679 no
01:29:36.239 what what's the way out of this what do
01:29:38.239 you think is like if if you had the
01:29:40.320 president's ear or if people wanted to
01:29:42.159 just listen to you openly
01:29:44.320 what do you think is the way out of this
01:29:46.480 so let's let's clear up the data clear
01:29:48.239 up the data so
01:29:50.000 like i said uh something should be
01:29:51.840 required as code but only if it is uh
01:29:53.280 somebody has been tested uh
01:29:55.600 has received a positive positive cover
01:29:57.679 test not if they simply have symptoms
01:29:59.600 one of like 100 symptoms and then if
01:30:03.040 if it is a cover death it must be
01:30:05.280 separated or was this was coveted a
01:30:06.719 primary primary reason for death or did
01:30:08.560 they also have stage three cancer heart
01:30:10.320 disease emphysema
01:30:12.480 and got hit by a bus
01:30:14.239 and had covered
01:30:16.239 yeah i've read all this stuff about that
01:30:18.080 about them uh
01:30:20.320 diagnosing people as a covet death
01:30:22.800 despite other variables this is not a
01:30:25.040 this is not a this is not a a
01:30:28.000 question this is what is occurring
01:30:30.880 and where are you reading this from
01:30:32.239 where are you getting this from the
01:30:34.320 public health health officials have
01:30:35.679 literally said this
01:30:37.199 this is not this is not a question mark
01:30:39.520 right but this is never this is
01:30:41.280 unprecedented right like if someone had
01:30:43.199 the flu but also had a heart attack they
01:30:45.040 would assume that that person died of a
01:30:46.400 heart attack yes yeah so this is
01:30:49.199 unprecedented is this because
01:30:51.360 this is such a a popular i don't i don't
01:30:54.080 want to use that word the wrong way but
01:30:55.920 that's what i mean a popular subject
01:30:59.920 and financial incentives yes
01:31:03.199 and like so this is not some sort of it
01:31:05.600 a moral indictment of of sort of
01:31:07.679 hospital administrators it's just
01:31:09.440 they're in it they're
01:31:10.880 they're in a in a tough
01:31:13.120 in a tough spot here
01:31:14.719 um they actually don't have enough
01:31:16.400 patience
01:31:17.440 to
01:31:18.320 to pay everyone for it to with without
01:31:20.320 following following doctors and and
01:31:22.719 firing staff and yeah they're running
01:31:25.360 potentially going bankrupt so
01:31:27.920 so then they're like okay well the
01:31:29.440 stimulus bill says if you know we get
01:31:31.360 all this
01:31:32.480 you know money if we say
01:31:35.040 if if they if it's a cover death i'm
01:31:37.040 like okay
01:31:38.480 they coughed before they died
01:31:41.520 in fact they're not even diagnosed with
01:31:42.880 cover they simply if you had weakness a
01:31:45.440 cough
01:31:46.560 uh shortness of breath but frankly i'm
01:31:48.320 not sure how you die without those
01:31:49.760 things
01:31:51.760 yeah you yeah but there's so many
01:31:54.560 different
01:31:55.920 things that you could attribute to covet
01:31:57.440 too there's so many symptoms
01:31:59.199 there's diarrhea headaches dehydration
01:32:02.400 yeah cough
01:32:03.520 yes but to be clear you you don't even
01:32:05.679 need to have gotten a cover diagram
01:32:09.120 you simply need to have had one of many
01:32:12.480 symptoms
01:32:13.600 and then have died for some reason
01:32:16.400 and it's
01:32:17.920 covered
01:32:19.600 so then it makes the death count look
01:32:21.440 very high
01:32:22.639 and then we're then stuck in a bind
01:32:24.480 because it looks like the death count's
01:32:25.679 super high and not going down like it
01:32:27.600 should be
01:32:28.800 and now
01:32:30.320 so then we we should keep whatever
01:32:32.880 you know
01:32:36.560 keep you know the shelter in place stuff
01:32:39.280 there and and keep people in their home
01:32:40.960 you know confined people to homes so we
01:32:43.040 need to break out of this this we're
01:32:44.960 stuck in a loop yeah
01:32:47.040 and i think the way to break out of this
01:32:48.639 loop is to have clarity of information
01:32:51.679 clarity of information will certainly
01:32:53.120 help but
01:32:54.560 altering perceptions public perception
01:32:57.679 from people that are basically in a
01:32:59.199 panic there's a lot of essentially
01:33:01.600 well
01:33:02.480 at least a month ago we're clearly in a
01:33:05.040 panic i mean right where you know when
01:33:07.040 you look around april 5th
01:33:09.120 april 6th people were really freaking
01:33:11.520 out but here we are may
01:33:13.920 and may people are relaxing a little bit
01:33:17.199 yes they're realizing like hey um i
01:33:19.600 actually know a couple of people that
01:33:20.719 got it it was just a cough and i know
01:33:22.639 some people that got it where nothing
01:33:23.920 happened i know a lot of people have got
01:33:25.679 it
01:33:28.960 i know zero people who died that i mean
01:33:30.880 about no yeah a lot of people got it
01:33:34.320 yeah it's it's not what we feared
01:33:36.880 we feared something much worse yeah
01:33:38.560 that's correct so the adjustment's
01:33:40.080 difficult to make so you said
01:33:41.840 first of all we need real data we need
01:33:44.639 just just parse out the data don't don't
01:33:46.239 lump it all together no and then if if
01:33:48.800 you give if you get people
01:33:50.400 just
01:33:51.360 parse out the data better
01:33:53.280 clear clearer information
01:33:55.520 um
01:33:56.880 about uh like i said was this an actual
01:33:59.760 code of a diagnosis or was it a or did
01:34:02.080 they get the test and the test came back
01:34:03.760 positive or do they just have some
01:34:04.880 symptoms just parse those two out um and
01:34:08.000 then
01:34:08.960 parse out just uh if somebody died did
01:34:11.360 they die
01:34:12.639 did they did they even have a covet test
01:34:15.760 or or did they just have one of many
01:34:17.199 symptoms like like like how do you die
01:34:19.360 without weakness i don't know right it's
01:34:21.440 impossible basically yeah it's a good
01:34:23.520 point if you're gonna die you're gonna
01:34:24.639 have shortness of breath weakness and
01:34:26.960 you might cough a little
01:34:28.320 um so so was it quantified what was it
01:34:31.040 yeah that person did they actually have
01:34:32.560 a covert test and and the tests come
01:34:34.560 back positive and then um if if they
01:34:36.560 died did they uh die where where covert
01:34:39.280 was
01:34:40.159 um it didn't have to be the main course
01:34:42.159 but it was a significant contributor to
01:34:44.560 their death or was it not a significant
01:34:47.040 contributor to the death
01:34:49.920 right it's not as simple as just because
01:34:52.320 you had covet covet killed you
01:34:55.760 definitely not right yeah yeah i mean
01:34:58.560 people die all the time and they have
01:34:59.679 like flu and yes you know other colds
01:35:01.679 and well we don't say that they died of
01:35:03.360 those flu and other colds well that's
01:35:04.719 what's so weird absolutely it's so
01:35:06.719 popular
01:35:07.920 and i use that word in a weird way but
01:35:09.679 it's so popular that we've kind of
01:35:11.760 forgotten people die pneumonia every day
01:35:15.040 yeah people die of
01:35:16.960 the flu didn't take a break oh kovitz
01:35:19.199 got this i'm gonna sit this one out i'm
01:35:21.199 gonna be on the bench i'm gonna wait
01:35:23.040 until kovitz done before i jump back
01:35:25.040 into the game of killing people no the
01:35:27.119 flu is still here killing people i mean
01:35:29.360 ev every year in the world several
01:35:30.880 hundred thousand people die directly of
01:35:32.880 the flu yeah not not tangentially right
01:35:36.800 not every 61 000 in this country last
01:35:39.760 year yeah and we're only five percent of
01:35:41.440 the world
01:35:42.400 and then there's cigarettes so oh man
01:35:44.480 cigarettes not cigarettes will really
01:35:46.000 kill you that's a weird one right we're
01:35:48.560 terrified of this disease that were
01:35:50.560 projected it could potentially kill 100
01:35:53.440 if not 200 000 americans this year with
01:35:55.600 cigarettes kill 500 000 and you don't
01:35:58.400 hear a peep out of any politician
01:36:01.600 there's no one running for congress is
01:36:03.360 trying to ban cigarettes there's no one
01:36:05.119 running for senate that wants to put
01:36:06.960 some education plan in place it's going
01:36:08.800 to stop cigarettes in their tracks
01:36:11.119 yeah i mean
01:36:12.960 a long time like several years ago i
01:36:15.280 mean along with 10 10 years ago i helped
01:36:17.199 make a movie cold thank you for smoking
01:36:19.280 oh i saw that yeah um
01:36:24.000 it it
01:36:26.639 yeah
01:36:27.679 um
01:36:31.280 yeah it's crazy uh
01:36:34.159 smoking barbecuing alongside just bad
01:36:36.400 news it's not not good you know you're
01:36:39.040 turning your lungs into smoke smoked
01:36:40.400 beef and not great
01:36:42.239 um
01:36:43.600 so
01:36:44.400 um yeah
01:36:46.560 tylenol by the way also kills a lot of
01:36:48.400 people yeah what is the number for
01:36:50.000 tylenol over here um i'm not sure the
01:36:52.480 exact number but i believe it
01:36:54.719 until the opioid crisis i believe
01:36:56.880 tylenol was the number one killer of all
01:36:59.199 drugs
01:37:00.159 um because wow basically it's uh
01:37:03.199 if you have if you get drunk and take a
01:37:05.040 lot of tylenol
01:37:06.639 um acetaminophen essentially it causes
01:37:09.679 liver failure
01:37:11.520 so sevilla would like get
01:37:13.840 get wasted and then like have a headache
01:37:15.360 and then pop a tonic tylenol gardens
01:37:18.400 whoa yeah curtains is a funny word yeah
01:37:21.920 you know so but nobody's like you know
01:37:24.800 raging against tylenol
01:37:26.560 yeah
01:37:27.600 it's weird except acceptable deaths are
01:37:29.679 weird and that's the real the slippery
01:37:31.600 slope about this uh people shaming
01:37:33.520 people for wanting to go back to work
01:37:36.000 you know other people are gonna die well
01:37:37.679 if you drive do you drive oh well you
01:37:40.400 should stop driving because people die
01:37:42.080 from driving
01:37:43.360 so you know you definitely should fill
01:37:45.920 up all the swimming pools because like
01:37:47.840 50 people die every day in this country
01:37:49.520 from swimming so let's not swim anymore
01:37:52.080 yeah what is the
01:37:53.920 really dangerous we need to chop down
01:37:55.520 all the coconuts
01:37:57.040 coconuts kill 150 people every year yes
01:37:59.440 cut down all the coconut trees we need
01:38:00.960 those people yes it's at a certain point
01:38:03.440 in time it's like
01:38:05.520 we
01:38:06.320 yeah we're vulnerable and we're also
01:38:09.119 we we're also we have a finite existence
01:38:11.199 no matter what we do nobody lives
01:38:13.119 forever
01:38:14.320 right um
01:38:15.360 i mean the the the i mean i think you
01:38:17.280 want to look at say deaths as like the
01:38:20.560 but for this
01:38:22.080 uh disease whatever they would have
01:38:23.840 lived x number of years yeah you know so
01:38:26.880 um
01:38:27.760 you know if somebody dies when they're
01:38:29.119 they're they're 20 and could live till
01:38:30.719 80 they they lost 60 years
01:38:32.719 but if somebody dies when they're 80 and
01:38:34.719 they might live until 81 they last one
01:38:36.639 year yes so it's it's like how many life
01:38:39.199 years were lost
01:38:40.639 uh is is a probably you know the right
01:38:43.360 metric to
01:38:44.400 use i don't uh read my own comments but
01:38:46.639 i do read other people's comments and i
01:38:47.920 was reading this one little twitter beef
01:38:49.199 that was going on where someone was
01:38:51.119 saying that kovid takes an average of 10
01:38:54.800 years off people's lives and we should
01:38:57.360 appreciate those 10 years and then
01:38:59.119 someone else said that's not true
01:39:01.040 i'm sure it's not true yeah definitely
01:39:02.159 it's the twitter
01:39:03.760 but someone else said
01:39:05.679 the average age of people who die from
01:39:07.840 covid is older than the average age
01:39:10.400 people die
01:39:12.320 it's very let's say just say it's like
01:39:14.639 it's it's about the same
01:39:16.480 that's a beautiful way of looking at it
01:39:18.800 i mean it's it's unfortunate it sucks
01:39:21.679 but it sucks if grandpa dies of
01:39:23.360 alzheimer's or emphysema or leukemia it
01:39:27.040 sucks sure it sucks when someone you
01:39:28.960 love dies yes
01:39:31.040 but
01:39:32.159 i i'm
01:39:33.360 i mean actually if if this uh i think a
01:39:36.320 lesson to be taken here
01:39:38.080 that i think is quite important is that
01:39:40.480 if
01:39:41.600 um
01:39:42.639 if you have you know your great
01:39:43.920 grandparents and their their age and
01:39:45.600 grandparents really be careful with uh
01:39:49.040 with with uh
01:39:50.880 you know any kind of flu or cold or
01:39:53.119 something that that wouldn't is not
01:39:55.679 dangerous to
01:39:57.199 kids or young adults but is dangerous
01:39:59.040 too to help the elderly is um if
01:40:01.679 basically if your kids got a runny nose
01:40:04.400 they should stay away from their
01:40:05.920 grandparents
01:40:08.000 no matter what it is it's it's uh the
01:40:10.239 things that are
01:40:11.600 where a young immune system is has no
01:40:14.159 problem and an older one has has a
01:40:16.159 problem yeah and
01:40:17.760 um in fact a lot of the a lot of the
01:40:19.440 deaths are just are literally it's
01:40:20.960 tragic but they're they're intra family
01:40:23.360 um it's the the the
01:40:26.560 little little kid had it had a you know
01:40:29.760 called or flew and give it to grandpa
01:40:31.920 yeah yeah they have the family gathering
01:40:33.600 and they don't know that this is a big
01:40:36.080 deal but it's
01:40:37.280 it's just important to remember when you
01:40:38.639 get older your immune system is just not
01:40:40.400 that strong and uh
01:40:42.239 and and so just be be careful with your
01:40:44.560 with with your you know
01:40:46.560 loved ones or elderly and i think there
01:40:48.880 is some
01:40:50.480 true objective
01:40:52.560 um understanding of the immune system
01:40:55.280 and the ways to boost that immune system
01:40:57.600 and i really think that that
01:41:00.000 that information should be
01:41:02.480 that should be distributed in a way a
01:41:04.719 non-judgmental way but like look this is
01:41:07.040 this is a way that we can all like this
01:41:09.440 is a scientifically proven way that we
01:41:11.119 can boost our immune system and it might
01:41:12.880 save your life and it might save the
01:41:14.159 life of your loved ones and maybe we
01:41:15.920 could teach this to our grandparents and
01:41:18.159 our parents and and people that are
01:41:19.920 vulnerable you know vitamin c heat shock
01:41:23.119 proteins all these different variables
01:41:25.040 that we know contribute to a stronger
01:41:27.520 immune system
01:41:30.000 yeah um actually just um
01:41:33.600 a thing that that is is is tough uh
01:41:37.679 if
01:41:38.480 like when you as you get older it's it's
01:41:41.119 hard to
01:41:42.560 be
01:41:43.280 you pretend to put on weight
01:41:44.880 you know i certainly that's happening
01:41:46.239 with me you know like as the older i get
01:41:47.920 i'm like damn it's harder to stay lean
01:41:50.480 uh that's for sure
01:41:51.760 um
01:41:52.880 and and so actually being being
01:41:54.719 overweight is is a big deal yeah just uh
01:41:57.600 it's a fact uh
01:41:59.119 well
01:42:00.400 yeah the new york hospital said it was
01:42:02.080 the number one factor for severe uh
01:42:04.800 kovid symptoms was obesity that was
01:42:07.360 number one factor it is that that's yes
01:42:10.239 exactly
01:42:12.480 but it's also we live in a world where
01:42:14.239 people want to be
01:42:16.880 sensitive to other people's feelings so
01:42:18.719 yeah absolutely we don't want to
01:42:20.639 bring up the fact that
01:42:22.400 being fat's bad for you it's a judgment
01:42:24.639 on your food's great yeah i do love food
01:42:28.159 yeah and i mean i mean to be totally
01:42:29.920 frank i mean speaking for myself i'd i'd
01:42:32.719 rather eat tasty food and live a shorter
01:42:34.400 life
01:42:35.600 yeah you know
01:42:37.119 yeah those moments of enjoying a great
01:42:40.320 meal yeah and then even talking about
01:42:42.320 they're valuable they're worth something
01:42:44.719 yeah it's not we don't want to eat
01:42:45.920 soylent green and live to be 160.
01:42:50.719 tasty if it was great one of the best
01:42:52.159 things about life it really is yeah it's
01:42:54.719 an art form as well it's like
01:42:56.560 fine food
01:42:58.000 it's a it's a it's a
01:43:00.639 it's
01:43:01.520 a delicious sand castle it's temporary
01:43:04.080 it doesn't last very long but there's
01:43:06.080 something about it that's very pleasing
01:43:08.639 yeah yeah um
01:43:11.040 yeah i mean
01:43:12.400 i i don't know what what advice to give
01:43:14.639 like um maybe smaller have tasty food
01:43:17.520 with smaller amounts of it
01:43:20.000 yeah and
01:43:21.360 i think
01:43:22.560 regulated feeding windows really the way
01:43:24.320 to go some sort of an intermittent
01:43:25.840 fasting approach sure when i started
01:43:28.080 doing that i i
01:43:29.760 i i found myself to be quite a bit
01:43:31.840 healthier when i've deviated from that
01:43:33.440 i've gained weight so how what's what's
01:43:35.520 uh 16 hours well 16 hours yeah
01:43:38.560 so like at night or yeah yeah yeah so i
01:43:41.199 get to a certain point and then i count
01:43:43.920 out i usually uh hit the stopwatch on my
01:43:46.800 phone and then i look at uh 15 hours and
01:43:50.080 i'm like okay got an hour before i can
01:43:51.760 eat yeah and so
01:43:53.520 anything in between that is just water
01:43:55.280 or coffee
01:43:56.480 actually you know like um
01:43:58.239 this may be a useful bit of advice for
01:44:00.239 for people but uh eating before you go
01:44:02.880 to bed is a real bad idea and actually
01:44:05.040 negatively affects your sleep yeah um
01:44:07.280 and it can actually cause uh it
01:44:09.440 heartburn that you don't even know is
01:44:10.960 happening and and that subtle heartburn
01:44:13.679 uh affects your sleep because you're
01:44:15.920 you're horizontal and your body's
01:44:17.760 digesting
01:44:19.360 so if you want to improve the quality of
01:44:20.800 your sleep um and and um
01:44:23.840 you know uh you know
01:44:25.679 be healthier uh it's it's do not eat
01:44:28.000 right before we go to sleep yeah it's
01:44:29.920 like one of the worst things you could
01:44:30.800 do i had some of the biggest mistakes
01:44:32.800 i've ever met i've i've done that uh
01:44:34.320 particularly after comedy shows i'm
01:44:35.840 starving i'll come home and i'll eat and
01:44:38.080 then i go to bed and i just feel like
01:44:40.000 [ __ ] and i wake up in the middle of the
01:44:41.920 night it's gonna it's gonna crush your
01:44:43.600 sleep and it's gonna it's gonna damage
01:44:45.199 your
01:44:46.080 uh pilot your pyloric sphincter and your
01:44:48.239 esophagus and it's it's it's so
01:44:50.560 in fact
01:44:51.440 drinking and then going to sleep is
01:44:53.360 that's one of the worst things you could
01:44:54.800 yes um
01:44:56.719 so
01:44:57.679 uh just
01:44:59.119 try to avoid drinking and and
01:45:05.440 you know
01:45:06.239 um
01:45:08.000 small amounts of alcohol that
01:45:10.159 evidence suggests it's not it doesn't
01:45:12.480 have a
01:45:14.320 negative effect i put in the same
01:45:15.679 category as delicious food it kind of
01:45:17.360 makes things a little more fun
01:45:19.119 yeah yeah i like it i mean some of the
01:45:21.119 people some of the people who have left
01:45:22.400 the longest you know um there's a woman
01:45:24.960 in france who i think
01:45:26.320 maybe has the record or close to it and
01:45:28.239 she had a glass of wine every day every
01:45:30.000 day you know yeah
01:45:31.280 small small amounts is fine um
01:45:34.639 but um
01:45:36.159 yeah this is like a i i learned this
01:45:38.159 like quite late in life it's like just
01:45:39.920 avoid having alcohol and avoid eating
01:45:43.280 at least two or three hours before going
01:45:44.800 to sleep and your quality of life will
01:45:46.880 your quality of sleep will improve and
01:45:48.880 your general health will improve a lot
01:45:51.119 for sure this is a it's a big deal and i
01:45:53.119 think not widely not widely known do you
01:45:55.360 have time to
01:45:56.840 exercise um
01:45:58.960 a little bit
01:46:00.080 um do you train or anything
01:46:02.719 um i do although i haven't seen
01:46:05.440 for a while but
01:46:07.280 um
01:46:08.639 yeah especially yeah from out like uh
01:46:12.159 you know say we're working on starship
01:46:14.320 or something in south texas and i'm just
01:46:16.159 living in my i got a little
01:46:18.159 little house there in bukuchika village
01:46:20.400 um
01:46:21.199 and i don't have much to do so
01:46:24.000 we're like i'm working and i was like
01:46:25.600 dude just lift some weights or something
01:46:27.280 you know um
01:46:29.360 maybe uh i i i
01:46:31.440 like i don't some people love running i
01:46:33.040 don't love running
01:46:34.239 um but what do you like to do exercise
01:46:36.480 wise
01:46:37.760 um
01:46:39.199 too totally frank i wouldn't exercise at
01:46:41.679 all if i could but if if i
01:46:44.159 i'd prefer not to exercise but if i'm
01:46:46.080 going to exercise and you know lift some
01:46:47.920 weights and
01:46:49.119 um
01:46:50.159 and then
01:46:51.280 kind of run on the treadmill and maybe
01:46:53.360 watch a show that you know if there's a
01:46:55.840 compelling show that like pulls you in
01:46:57.440 right right right yeah that's a good
01:46:59.040 thing to do yeah watch a good movie or
01:47:01.920 yeah yeah episode of black mirror or
01:47:03.280 something like that that's great man
01:47:04.880 don't watch black mirror before going to
01:47:06.159 bed either well don't watch black mirror
01:47:07.679 today
01:47:08.639 it's too [ __ ] accurate yeah exactly
01:47:10.480 it's like wait this already happened in
01:47:12.080 real life
01:47:13.520 yeah they're too close it's too close
01:47:15.920 well even didn't jamie did you say that
01:47:17.840 the the guy who makes black mirror
01:47:20.800 mics off uh yeah yeah he said he it's
01:47:23.119 not a good time to start season six yeah
01:47:25.119 he wants to hold off because
01:47:27.119 reality he's nailed it is black mirror
01:47:29.440 oh man it's like he's gonna have to like
01:47:31.360 re reassess
01:47:33.600 and and attack it from a different angle
01:47:35.760 yeah
01:47:36.400 you should try something that's fun to
01:47:38.560 do that's not just like
01:47:41.119 like learn a martial art or something
01:47:42.719 like that i did martial arts when i was
01:47:44.400 kid like did you would you um
01:47:47.440 i did
01:47:49.119 taekwondo i did karate uh kaika shrinkai
01:47:52.719 all right cool and um
01:47:54.880 judo um
01:47:56.960 also you you really branched out yeah um
01:48:01.040 so
01:48:02.560 um
01:48:05.199 and did brazilian jiu jitsu briefly did
01:48:07.199 you yeah where i made in palo alto
01:48:09.920 really yeah oh no [ __ ] i was gonna
01:48:12.320 suggest that that's a great thing for
01:48:14.159 people like that's a thing about jiu
01:48:16.480 jitsu if you look at it from the outside
01:48:19.040 you think oh a bunch of meat heads
01:48:21.040 strangling each other sure but they're
01:48:22.480 some of the smartest people i know or
01:48:24.400 jiu jitsu fiends because they they get
01:48:27.520 they first of all they get introduced to
01:48:29.360 it because usually either they want to
01:48:31.119 exercise or learn some self-defense but
01:48:33.520 then they realize that it's essentially
01:48:35.440 like a language
01:48:37.199 with your body like you're having an
01:48:39.199 argument with someone with some sort of
01:48:41.199 a physical language
01:48:43.119 and it's really complex and the more
01:48:45.440 access to vocabulary and the sharper
01:48:48.400 your words are sure the the more you'll
01:48:51.040 succeed in these ventures that's really
01:48:54.400 also an accurate analogy of what jiu
01:48:56.639 jitsu is yeah i mean i kind of i mean
01:48:59.040 probably like a lot of people uh for the
01:49:01.199 the way uh early day uh the first mma
01:49:04.480 fights and joyce gracie and he was like
01:49:06.800 incredible and it was like just like
01:49:08.880 technique yeah yeah it was like you know
01:49:11.679 winning against people way bigger and
01:49:13.040 that kind of thing it's just like oh
01:49:14.400 this is cool it was what martial arts
01:49:16.239 were supposed to be when we were as we
01:49:17.760 were kids yeah when you saw bruce lee
01:49:19.520 [ __ ] up all these big giant guys like
01:49:21.360 wow martial arts allow you to beat
01:49:24.239 someone far bigger and stronger than you
01:49:25.920 right
01:49:27.280 most of the time that's not real
01:49:29.520 especially if they know martial arts too
01:49:32.320 it's like oh no yes but in the ufc when
01:49:35.599 hoist gracie
01:49:36.880 off of his back was strangling dan
01:49:39.199 severin with his legs he was like holy
01:49:41.440 [ __ ] yeah this guy's being pinned by
01:49:43.679 this big giant wrestler and he wraps his
01:49:46.080 legs around his neck and chokes him to
01:49:48.080 the point the guy has to surrender yeah
01:49:49.920 amazing yeah it was amazing
01:49:52.239 i mean horse got beaten up pretty bad in
01:49:54.080 some of those he did well he definitely
01:49:56.000 had some rough fights but he won he won
01:49:58.239 yeah
01:49:59.199 he's a legend and but what it showed in
01:50:02.080 i mean i'm a huge lover of jiu jitsu
01:50:04.800 what it showed is that there is a method
01:50:07.520 for uh
01:50:08.880 for
01:50:09.760 diffusing these situations with
01:50:11.599 technique and and knowledge yeah and i
01:50:14.159 think it's also a great way to exercise
01:50:16.080 too because it's almost like the
01:50:17.840 exercise is secondary to the learning of
01:50:20.000 the thing the the exercises like you
01:50:22.480 want like and you want to develop
01:50:24.239 strength and conditioning just so that
01:50:25.599 you could be better at doing the thing
01:50:27.360 and the analogy that i use is like if
01:50:29.280 you imagine if you had a race car
01:50:31.360 and you could actually give the race car
01:50:34.080 better handling and more horsepower just
01:50:36.400 from your own focus and effort sure
01:50:38.560 that's really what it's like yeah
01:50:40.080 totally yeah
01:50:42.480 when am i going to have my my kids i
01:50:44.000 should say i sent my kids to
01:50:46.239 uh jiu jitsu uh since they were like i
01:50:48.960 don't know six oh really yeah oh that's
01:50:51.520 awesome yeah
01:50:53.360 it's it's a great thing to learn it
01:50:54.880 really is seems like a good yes yeah
01:50:57.119 maybe something like i mean even if you
01:50:59.119 just have someone who hits that holds
01:51:00.639 the pads for you like you get a workout
01:51:02.639 in and to be fun
01:51:05.440 um when am i going to be able to buy one
01:51:06.960 of them roadsters when's that happening
01:51:09.599 well i can't you know
01:51:12.960 say exactly when but uh
01:51:16.400 we got to get
01:51:17.760 you know
01:51:18.840 those this cover thing's kind of
01:51:20.960 throwing us for a loop i'm sure um so
01:51:24.560 um
01:51:25.520 not to blame everything in the code but
01:51:28.320 um
01:51:29.360 it's you know
01:51:30.719 certainly set us back on on progress for
01:51:33.520 you know some number of months um
01:51:36.960 the i mean things we've got to get get
01:51:38.320 done
01:51:39.280 uh ahead of roadster are um
01:51:42.159 you know ramping up model y production
01:51:44.560 um that'll be a great great car it is a
01:51:47.679 great car
01:51:49.360 getting the
01:51:50.960 berlin gigafactory built
01:51:54.400 and and
01:51:55.440 also building y
01:51:56.719 getting expanding the shanghai factory
01:51:58.719 which is going great
01:52:01.360 and um
01:52:03.599 get the you know there's a cyber truck
01:52:05.840 semi truck roadster
01:52:08.239 um
01:52:09.360 roaster is kind of like dessert
01:52:11.119 so
01:52:12.320 like we we gotta get the
01:52:14.960 you know eating potatoes and greens and
01:52:16.800 stuff
01:52:17.520 you know like
01:52:18.719 but roaster comes before cyber truck
01:52:24.639 i mean i think we should do cyber truck
01:52:26.719 first before before road before started
01:52:29.199 interesting
01:52:30.400 i'm not mad at that some other things
01:52:32.159 for roadster uh they're they're you know
01:52:34.719 the tri-motor
01:52:36.159 uh plaid powertrain we're gonna have
01:52:38.239 that in model s
01:52:40.239 uh so that's like part one of the
01:52:42.159 ingredients that's needed for for
01:52:43.760 roadsters the the plaid powertrain the
01:52:46.400 more advanced bat you know battery
01:52:47.599 vacuum kind of thing i wanted to ask you
01:52:48.880 about this before i forgot what there's
01:52:50.239 a company that's called apex is taking
01:52:52.480 your teslas and
01:52:54.159 they're
01:52:54.960 giving it a wider base and
01:52:57.440 wider tires and a little bit more
01:52:59.599 advanced suspension
01:53:01.280 sure how do you feel about that are you
01:53:02.880 guys do you work with them are you cool
01:53:04.400 with those people yeah i mean just i'm
01:53:06.880 off yeah go ahead they're
01:53:09.280 jazzing stuff up with carbon fiber and
01:53:11.599 doing a bunch of interior choices
01:53:13.760 you're cool with you can't [ __ ] with
01:53:15.440 that you don't have time so is it good
01:53:17.280 that someone comes along and has a sort
01:53:18.960 of specialty operation yeah i got no
01:53:20.480 problem that's what it's called right
01:53:21.440 it's like jmg is it called apex yeah i
01:53:24.239 gotta unplug performance as apex that's
01:53:26.639 right unplug performance yeah yeah you
01:53:28.639 could for sure um
01:53:31.520 you know lighten the car up and uh
01:53:33.920 improve to tire traction and have you
01:53:35.920 seen that company's stuff what they do i
01:53:37.920 don't know specifically but there's it's
01:53:39.520 pretty dope yeah they make a pretty dope
01:53:41.599 looking they take model s and they they
01:53:43.599 widen it and give it a bunch of carbon
01:53:45.199 fiber that's it right there
01:53:47.920 that looks pretty nice yeah it does
01:53:50.719 now the the plaid
01:53:52.480 version of the model s you are you going
01:53:55.119 to widen the track and doing a bunch
01:53:57.520 do a bunch of different i know you guys
01:53:58.800 are testing at the nurburgring can you
01:54:00.560 not talk about that well i think we got
01:54:02.480 to leave that for
01:54:04.080 you know proper sort of product unveil i
01:54:06.239 understand yeah i understand um last
01:54:08.800 time you were here you convinced me to
01:54:10.719 buy a tesla i bought it and it's [ __ ]
01:54:13.280 insane oh great glad you like it um
01:54:15.920 i don't it's not just pretty fun it's
01:54:17.679 like i the way i've described it is it
01:54:19.520 makes other cars seem stupid
01:54:21.440 they just seem dumb like i love dumb
01:54:23.679 things i love dumb cars like i love
01:54:25.920 campfires yeah i love campfires i have a
01:54:29.239 1993 porsche that's air-cooled sure it's
01:54:32.480 like re it's not that fast it's really
01:54:34.639 slow compared to the tesla yeah really
01:54:36.480 so it's really quite slow yeah but
01:54:38.159 there's something
01:54:39.280 engaging about the mechanical
01:54:42.239 this is like the the gears and it's very
01:54:45.040 it's very analog but it's so stupid in
01:54:48.000 comparison to the tesla like when i want
01:54:49.840 to go somewhere in the model s i hit the
01:54:51.599 gas and just goes
01:54:53.280 yeah it just it like violates time
01:54:57.280 yeah yeah um
01:54:59.520 yeah you've tried it like ludicrous plus
01:55:01.119 and stuff yeah yeah cool
01:55:03.199 oh yeah we did just did a software
01:55:05.360 update where it'll do it like a cheetah
01:55:07.040 stance so uh yeah so it's it because
01:55:10.320 it's got a
01:55:11.199 dynamic air suspension so it lowers the
01:55:12.960 back oh jesus
01:55:14.719 yeah just like uh like a sprinter
01:55:16.159 basically right like what do you do if
01:55:17.440 you're a sprinter you're going to hunker
01:55:18.560 down and then
01:55:20.000 uh so
01:55:21.679 i shaved like a 10th of a second off
01:55:23.199 zero six i mean like you know
01:55:25.360 it is pretty fun it's so i've taken so
01:55:28.000 many people and i'm like i take them for
01:55:30.159 the holy [ __ ] moment i'm like you ready
01:55:32.000 like hang on there and then a stomp on
01:55:33.520 the gas i've never felt anything like it
01:55:35.440 it's confusing
01:55:37.280 yeah it really is
01:55:38.960 the the instant torque the instant
01:55:40.880 torque and just the sheer acceleration
01:55:43.280 is baffling it's baffling it's baffling
01:55:45.520 they've never felt it no it's faster
01:55:47.119 than falling it's crazy it's so fast
01:55:49.920 it's a roller coaster yeah and my family
01:55:52.320 yells at me when i stomp the gas like um
01:55:54.400 i tell my kids i'm like you want to feel
01:55:55.920 it you want to feel it like do it do it
01:55:57.360 do it my wife's like don't do it
01:56:01.360 yeah and even if i just do it on the
01:56:02.800 highway for a couple of seconds that's
01:56:04.080 pretty exciting yeah it's very it's like
01:56:05.760 having a roller coaster on tap you know
01:56:07.679 it really is like a roller coaster on
01:56:09.199 top yeah without the loopty loops but
01:56:11.040 it's the the pinning to your seat it
01:56:13.520 seems like you're not supposed to be
01:56:15.040 able to experience that from some sort
01:56:16.560 of a can you know a consumer vehicle
01:56:18.960 that you can just a regular person could
01:56:21.040 buy if you have the money
01:56:22.880 it seems too too crazy
01:56:25.440 and then the idea of this roadster is a
01:56:28.080 half of a second faster than that
01:56:30.880 yeah that's madness
01:56:33.119 well if that roads with a roadster we're
01:56:34.719 going to do some things that are kind of
01:56:35.920 unfair
01:56:36.960 so
01:56:38.000 we're going to take some things from
01:56:39.520 like
01:56:40.480 you know from uh kind of like rock
01:56:42.320 rocket world and put them on the car so
01:56:44.560 oh i read about that explain that like
01:56:46.960 what do you do well like i said we can't
01:56:48.320 oh the product unveiled right here but
01:56:50.320 but
01:56:51.280 it's gonna do some things that aren't
01:56:52.400 fair
01:56:53.199 and then
01:56:54.400 the the when we do the unveil of the
01:56:57.599 roadster
01:56:58.719 let me just say that anyone who's been
01:57:00.800 waiting they won't be sorry
01:57:03.040 it's they won't be sorry oh i'm sure
01:57:05.440 well anything that goes zero to sixty
01:57:07.360 what is it one point nine is that the
01:57:08.880 zero 0-60 that's the base model that's
01:57:10.719 good
01:57:12.400 what's the top of the food chain model
01:57:14.880 okay okay
01:57:16.080 faster than that let's just say faster
01:57:18.080 yeah that seems so crazy to me now what
01:57:20.800 was it like when the dude threw the
01:57:23.520 steel balls at the window and they were
01:57:26.080 supposed to not break and it broke
01:57:29.199 well
01:57:30.320 yeah i mean i know
01:57:32.000 any circumstances
01:57:33.599 are you know you know that our demos are
01:57:35.679 authentic
01:57:36.610 [Laughter]
01:57:37.760 so i was not expecting that and i and
01:57:39.360 then i think i muttered under my breath
01:57:43.840 you didn't get mad though
01:57:45.520 no you didn't steve jobs it
01:57:48.000 um
01:57:49.119 no i i i definitely swore uh but you
01:57:52.880 know i didn't think the mic would pick
01:57:54.159 it up but it did um
01:57:56.159 and uh
01:57:57.840 but so
01:57:59.360 like we practiced this
01:58:01.199 you know behind the scenes yeah i would
01:58:03.360 like it tesla we don't do we don't do
01:58:05.760 like tons of practice for for our demos
01:58:08.080 because we we work we're working on the
01:58:10.800 cars like we you know we're building
01:58:13.280 new technologies and and improving the
01:58:15.679 the fundamental products so we're not
01:58:17.520 spending it like doing like hundreds of
01:58:19.920 you know practice things or anything
01:58:21.679 like that we don't have time for that um
01:58:23.679 but the the
01:58:25.280 just hours before the demo um both franz
01:58:28.800 uh you know uh is a head of design and
01:58:31.280 and i were in the studio throwing steel
01:58:33.679 balls at the window and it's bouncing
01:58:35.040 right off
01:58:36.159 um and like okay this seems pretty good
01:58:38.159 seems like we got it okay
01:58:40.159 um
01:58:41.360 and then we think what happened was that
01:58:44.000 um
01:58:45.199 when we
01:58:46.719 when when franz hit the the
01:58:48.719 the door with the sledgehammer
01:58:50.719 you know sure like like this is this is
01:58:52.480 like yeah yeah yeah exoskeleton
01:58:55.119 you know high strength hardened steel
01:58:56.960 you can literally
01:58:58.560 take wind up with a sledgehammer you
01:59:00.560 know full
01:59:01.760 double-handed sledgehammer
01:59:04.159 and hit the door and there's not even a
01:59:05.679 dent it's cool
01:59:08.560 but we think that that cracked the
01:59:10.320 corner of the glass
01:59:12.000 at the bottom
01:59:14.000 and then
01:59:15.599 once you crack the corner of the glass
01:59:17.199 that you just came over
01:59:18.800 so
01:59:19.840 uh
01:59:21.040 then when you threw the bowl that that's
01:59:23.199 what cracked the glass so it didn't go
01:59:24.639 through though it didn't go through
01:59:26.000 that's true that's true it didn't
01:59:27.520 shatter the whole thing like a regular
01:59:28.719 window would either which would just
01:59:30.239 dissolve yeah right
01:59:31.840 so in hindsight the ball should have
01:59:33.840 been first sledgehammer second yeah
01:59:36.320 yeah you live you learn yeah exactly
01:59:39.040 listen man uh we've taken up a lot of
01:59:41.040 your time you had a child yeah recently
