00:00:48.559 exaggeration

00:01:21.280 make-a-wish i can die happy well i'm
00:01:23.119 happy you're here yeah i got my fridge's
00:01:24.640 lane shirt because i believe all women
00:01:26.479 is that how you say it it's i think so
00:01:28.560 yeah i thought it was gallane
00:01:30.479 i thought it might be it's gizzling
00:01:33.840 do you know look at me no galen it's
00:01:36.400 just lame gizzling
00:01:38.159 that's a ridiculous name yeah her father
00:01:40.400 was a famous
00:01:41.600 uh mi6 massage spy that reportedly used
00:01:45.439 sex operatives to control people he died
00:01:47.200 being thrown off a yacht
00:01:48.720 in the middle of the atlantic ocean and
00:01:51.360 of course she
00:01:52.159 uh got caught in that farmhouse on the
00:01:54.159 east coast and she was really the pimp
00:01:56.079 over
00:01:56.479 epstein in a giant sex network ring over
00:01:59.040 scientists
00:01:59.840 that they were compromising uh so they
00:02:02.000 can control not just government but
00:02:03.119 industry and science and so
00:02:04.960 that was the master blackmail operation
00:02:06.560 they were running and her sisters are
00:02:08.239 big in tech
00:02:09.440 like isabelle maxwell she has sisters
00:02:11.599 that are in
00:02:12.560 u.s tech companies and i think two of
00:02:14.560 her sisters uh
00:02:15.920 were part of the creation of magellan
00:02:17.520 which was that big search engine like
00:02:19.040 really so yeah they are a very powerful
00:02:21.200 family and they have all kinds of
00:02:23.520 different operations yeah her dad was
00:02:25.120 the biggest publisher in
00:02:26.640 england and also the biggest owner of
00:02:29.040 private tv stations in england
00:02:31.120 and uh when he died it turned out he was
00:02:32.560 a front basically for intelligence
00:02:34.080 networks
00:02:35.280 now let me right off the bat say you
00:02:38.400 were telling me about epstein and this
00:02:40.879 island
00:02:42.080 years ago you were telling me long
00:02:44.720 before
00:02:45.440 anybody would i think you told me about
00:02:48.000 him
00:02:48.560 before his first arrest a long time ago
00:02:51.280 i talked about how they have these
00:02:52.319 islands they they fly they compromise
00:02:54.160 children but i learned all this from ted
00:02:56.560 gunderson
00:02:57.760 20 plus years ago he was in line to be
00:02:59.840 the fbi director
00:03:01.040 he was the head of the fbi in los
00:03:02.400 angeles he was a very famous fb
00:03:04.800 uh agent even ranco intel pro it's a
00:03:07.120 civil rights movement he apologized for
00:03:08.720 that before he died
00:03:09.920 uh in the 2011. but
00:03:13.040 he came out and he was the one that
00:03:14.480 explained to me about how they use these
00:03:16.239 these blackmail rings elements the cia
00:03:18.959 uh and foreign intelligence groups and
00:03:21.680 and how they would
00:03:22.560 basically make people have sex with
00:03:24.400 children to be part of these
00:03:26.159 clubs and these cults they were setting
00:03:27.599 up so i knew about all this from ted
00:03:29.440 gunderson were they young girls
00:03:31.280 that did they tell them these girls were
00:03:33.120 underage or did they look like they were
00:03:35.120 older
00:03:36.000 like like this uh the borap movie
00:03:39.120 where they uh yeah
00:03:42.239 if you haven't seen it it's very
00:03:43.440 disappointing because they set him up i
00:03:45.360 saw it
00:03:45.760 they did set him up but nothing happened
00:03:48.080 they made it look like
00:03:49.360 giuliani was jerking off in front of
00:03:50.879 this girl he was taking his mic off
00:03:52.560 he would have to be the biggest savage
00:03:54.319 on earth to jerk off
00:03:55.760 in that situation and they also said
00:03:58.159 that he inappropriately touched her back
00:03:59.840 when he touched her back i am not
00:04:01.120 exaggerating it was like this right it
00:04:03.519 was a couple of light taps on the back
00:04:05.519 while she was close to him taking off
00:04:08.159 his mic thing he goes
00:04:09.360 oh thank you very much dear and he goes
00:04:10.959 yes i just need your name and your phone
00:04:12.799 number
00:04:13.280 and then she takes off his mic and then
00:04:15.360 he leans back
00:04:16.478 and he's tucking his shirt back because
00:04:18.639 he just pulled the mic out right but
00:04:19.918 he's lying on the bed to do it now
00:04:22.000 if you're an old man and i'm sure he's
00:04:23.919 probably got a bad back
00:04:25.360 like that's probably how you would do it
00:04:27.440 but any of us that have had to put the
00:04:28.720 mics
00:04:29.199 on our side and then you put it in your
00:04:30.880 pants up your shirt and then you've got
00:04:32.720 it gets to be
00:04:33.360 you've got to get it out that's what you
00:04:34.560 do but but it's worse than that
00:04:36.400 remember when he was playing the who was
00:04:38.960 the gay character he played like 10
00:04:40.080 years ago
00:04:40.800 bruno bruno yeah remember congressman
00:04:43.440 ron paul the time was
00:04:44.720 had run for president and he's in the
00:04:46.560 hotel he goes oh the light broke please
00:04:48.240 step into this room
00:04:49.520 so there's no chair ron paul sits down
00:04:52.320 and he's read the newspaper
00:04:53.680 and bruno comes in and pulls his pants
00:04:55.759 out and says i wanna have sex with you
00:04:57.120 now that would be sexual assault if that
00:04:58.479 was a man to a woman ron paul pushes him
00:05:00.479 out of the way goes out of the room
00:05:01.840 and so this is what he does he's done it
00:05:03.520 to other people it's his specialty
00:05:05.280 is to say you're being interviewed
00:05:10.479 listen let me just before we go any
00:05:12.479 further i [ __ ]
00:05:13.759 love aaron cohen genius i think he's
00:05:16.720 brilliant i think he's amazing
00:05:18.320 but his interpretation of what happened
00:05:21.520 in the room with rudy giuliani it's it's
00:05:24.400 not accurate
00:05:25.440 in my opinion well listen i mean and who
00:05:27.680 is american
00:05:28.960 he's tapping her while she's touching
00:05:32.160 him
00:05:32.639 and removing his mic he does this little
00:05:34.960 tap on her waist
00:05:36.160 but it's not creepy it's like an old man
00:05:39.120 like a little tap tap tap
00:05:40.560 right like if if you want to take it out
00:05:42.720 of context like i don't know
00:05:44.320 if there's more to it than well let's go
00:05:46.479 further let's go further
00:05:47.919 right after this happens uh barat
00:05:50.960 sashmir cohen runs in in panties and a
00:05:53.520 bra saying have sex with me he's 15g too
00:05:56.160 old yes so this is and giuliani's like
00:05:58.479 what did that i'd have a heart
00:05:59.440 like what is this listen my [ __ ] 12
00:06:01.600 year old sense of humor loved it
00:06:03.120 yeah but the thing about it is they're
00:06:05.840 making it seem like giuliani was jerking
00:06:08.000 off in front of her yeah and that's not
00:06:09.600 like
00:06:10.000 he lies back and he's tucking his pants
00:06:13.120 like if can we show the whole thing so
00:06:15.600 we can look at it
00:06:16.560 we don't have to they put it on his
00:06:17.680 promotional material
00:06:24.960 but they put this out as promotional
00:06:26.319 material to be promoted
00:06:28.240 they put it out on twitter the clip is
00:06:29.600 on miss pat's give a shout out to mrs
00:06:31.840 pacquiao jamie's technically
00:06:34.400 it's on her uh instagram if you want to
00:06:36.960 but let me drop a bomb show on you joe
00:06:38.639 okay a bombshell no no i've been a big
00:06:41.280 fan of sasha barraco until i learned he
00:06:43.280 spoke at the adl
00:06:44.560 last year and called for my arrest
00:06:47.759 for free speech and he called for jeff
00:06:49.759 zuckerberg's arrest
00:06:51.440 uh for mark zuckerberg's arrest so he
00:06:54.240 called for my arrest
00:06:55.599 and and for mark zuckerberg's arrest for
00:06:58.160 free speech
00:06:58.960 he wants to work in hollywood right you
00:07:00.800 got to do what you got to do but let's
00:07:02.000 go further deals
00:07:03.120 agreement i mean he said arrest people
00:07:05.360 for their free speech
00:07:06.639 and he supports internet censorship so
00:07:08.319 how does he make his money being this
00:07:09.759 avant-garde cutting edge
00:07:11.360 really uh you know over the edge comic
00:07:14.319 that does things that could technically
00:07:15.599 be seen as illegal i support his free
00:07:17.120 speech and then he says i don't deserve
00:07:18.800 it well it's really dangerous
00:07:20.080 he's flawed like many great artists yeah
00:07:23.039 you know i mean i i'm
00:07:24.639 until they come for him he's not gonna
00:07:26.960 understand the slippery slope of
00:07:28.400 censorship and
00:07:29.360 you know this is another thing that you
00:07:31.280 know people
00:07:32.479 have uh people have criticized me for
00:07:35.759 being friends with you
00:07:36.800 and for talking to you and they also
00:07:38.400 criticized me for not supporting
00:07:40.720 a lot of these people that got banned
00:07:44.080 and de-platformed my take on it has
00:07:46.720 always been
00:07:47.840 the best way to counter wrong speech
00:07:51.440 is correct speech right when someone
00:07:53.759 says something
00:07:54.639 that's wrong or someone says a
00:07:56.000 conspiracy theory that's not accurate
00:07:58.000 the best way to counter that is is to to
00:08:00.960 do
00:08:01.360 better speech to have people say the
00:08:03.280 accurate information
00:08:04.560 and to let the truth rise to the top
00:08:06.960 when you start
00:08:07.759 censoring people the problem is it's a
00:08:10.560 [ __ ] slippery slope and there's a
00:08:12.240 reason why we've been so steadfast
00:08:14.639 in supporting the first amendment in
00:08:16.000 this country and people think it doesn't
00:08:17.680 apply to tech
00:08:18.560 because these tech institutes are
00:08:20.240 private businesses and they should be
00:08:21.759 able to do whatever they want with their
00:08:22.879 private business
00:08:23.759 the problem is that [ __ ] slippery
00:08:25.919 slope has gone
00:08:27.120 from censoring you from banning alex
00:08:29.120 jones off twitter a year and a half ago
00:08:31.120 to getting the white house pr press
00:08:33.039 secretary banned off twitter
00:08:35.039 because she posts something from the new
00:08:36.640 york post which is crazy
00:08:38.479 it's crazy it's cr that's a 200 and
00:08:40.240 whatever you're old america's oldest
00:08:41.599 newspaper
00:08:42.719 and the and what she said the the post
00:08:45.760 what the what they put printed and put
00:08:47.519 out there is accurate
00:08:48.800 well let's go further let's go further
00:08:51.040 they're denying
00:08:53.040 that that it's a real story but they
00:08:55.120 don't ever say the emails are fake
00:08:56.640 they just say it's a smear no it's a
00:08:58.480 real laptop the videos have been
00:09:00.000 released
00:09:00.640 it's confirmed but just think about this
00:09:02.399 it is a smear in that they're trying
00:09:04.160 they're putting it out there
00:09:05.519 they're they're timing it sure but
00:09:07.040 they're not denying they're not denying
00:09:08.560 it's real no it's real
00:09:09.920 it's real how did the laptop how did
00:09:12.160 this laptop become this big story that's
00:09:14.160 where it gets tricky yeah i'm curious
00:09:15.600 because
00:09:16.920 supposedly he dropped it off at
00:09:19.920 a laptop repair shop in delaware what an
00:09:22.480 idiot i mean who's
00:09:23.440 drawing that well crackhead right right
00:09:26.480 the guy's smoking i keep forgetting he
00:09:28.240 smokes crack well he did at the time
00:09:30.080 apparently he's kicked it so
00:09:31.200 congratulations to him
00:09:32.560 but the the guy who had some problems no
00:09:35.760 this is self-admitted and and also they
00:09:37.839 have the receipts
00:09:38.640 and they here's the thing he calls him
00:09:41.120 dozens of times
00:09:42.560 everybody knows when you bring a laptop
00:09:43.839 or anything and they say if you don't
00:09:44.959 pay for this
00:09:45.760 we're gonna wipe it and sell it and so
00:09:47.519 three months goes by six months goes by
00:09:49.519 nobody ever comes and gets it the guy
00:09:50.959 goes to look at it at the repair shop
00:09:53.040 the owner
00:09:53.760 and there's all these 25 000 files what
00:09:55.839 looks like underage girls
00:09:57.200 and all the rest of this crazy stuff and
00:09:58.640 him smoking cracker god knows what
00:10:00.640 he gives to the fbi ray does nothing the
00:10:03.040 director hides it from trump
00:10:05.279 and so people let's just say inside that
00:10:07.440 had copies of that
00:10:09.040 they leak it to rudolph giuliani who
00:10:11.279 then now has started to put it out so
00:10:12.720 instead of
00:10:13.360 instead of facing up to it they just say
00:10:15.279 anyone promoting this
00:10:16.640 whether it's the house or senate
00:10:18.079 committees that we're linking to it or
00:10:19.680 the new york post or the president's
00:10:21.600 press secretary you're now banned which
00:10:24.160 again shows it's
00:10:25.120 it's election meddling it's gatekeeping
00:10:27.519 to cover this up but i'll tell you what
00:10:28.560 else has come out now
00:10:30.959 his daughter biden's daughters uh
00:10:34.320 uh purportedly reportedly and they've
00:10:35.760 not denied it now this broke three days
00:10:37.040 ago
00:10:37.680 left her diary in a house that she had
00:10:39.680 rented and the diary talks about
00:10:42.000 all the same stuff and everything and
00:10:44.320 what that is
00:10:49.839 when i was looking into this the thing i
00:10:51.200 keep seeing people say is that he lived
00:10:52.640 in california he lived in california
00:10:54.399 that is true that's what i keep reading
00:10:56.000 but they fly back and forth to delaware
00:10:57.519 i mean
00:10:57.920 these are jet setters they fly to
00:10:59.200 ukraine that also might make sense that
00:11:01.040 that's why you didn't go back to
00:11:02.079 delaware to pick up the laptop
00:11:03.839 because when you're cracked out in
00:11:04.880 california it's really hard to make the
00:11:06.320 flight
00:11:08.800 all right right i don't know i don't
00:11:10.560 know so tim is the only one here

00:11:19.680 crackers
00:11:20.079 no i have free based cocaine which is
00:11:21.680 basically yeah it's close how close is
00:11:23.680 it
00:11:24.160 not not as close as where i ever went
00:11:26.160 made shady deals in the ukraine
00:11:29.120 well that's never done that by the way
00:11:30.640 that's in the emails that's in the
00:11:32.160 emails
00:11:33.120 finally where it's like yeah i need 30
00:11:34.720 million part of it goes the big guy

00:11:37.760 your dad and there's photos of them
00:11:39.200 meeting
00:11:39.839 and playing golf so let me tell you this
00:11:41.760 is real the fbi has the files
00:11:43.920 they admit it's real it's a big deal but
00:11:45.680 it's a real problem to ban this stuff
00:11:47.600 from twitter
00:11:48.480 putin rejects donald trump's criticism
00:11:50.480 of biden family business
00:11:52.079 well because it's russia's bribing
00:11:55.360 hunter biden 3.5 million through putin
00:11:59.360 through the moscow mayor who he's
00:12:00.800 friends with to hunter biden again
00:12:03.120 well if i was putin i would deny it too
00:12:04.880 listen putin has got to
00:12:06.880 love this if i was putin sitting back
00:12:10.160 right watching these [ __ ] people eat
00:12:12.079 themselves alive and destroy the first
00:12:13.680 amendment
00:12:14.240 destroy democracy yeah that's great i'm
00:12:16.560 sure
00:12:17.360 they have a hand in it i'm sure china
00:12:19.120 has a hand in it i'm sure
00:12:20.639 iran has a hand yeah this is what the
00:12:23.200 intelligence communities
00:12:24.560 have been telling us for a long time now
00:12:26.880 is that it's not just
00:12:28.160 one foreign company or foreign country
00:12:30.480 that's trying to
00:12:32.399 [ __ ] with our democracy yeah the idea
00:12:34.320 that the russians have a monopoly on
00:12:35.920 this
00:12:36.560 no i mean if the russians were an nfl
00:12:38.480 football team they'd be like the lower
00:12:40.000 third
00:12:40.880 the u.s and china are the top teams
00:12:42.399 right and we should say we should say
00:12:44.800 the united states does it too sure it's
00:12:46.959 100 confirmed
00:12:48.560 the idea that russians got trump in is
00:12:50.959 asinine because
00:12:52.079 here's what happens notice they tried to
00:12:53.760 impeach trump just nine months ago
00:12:56.079 for stuff in ukraine because whatever
00:12:58.639 they are worried about
00:12:59.760 they project okay so trump doesn't have
00:13:02.800 russia connections
00:13:03.839 trump doesn't have of those connections
00:13:06.240 trump doesn't have
00:13:07.760 those outside connections you can't buy
00:13:09.519 him he doesn't have lobbyists
00:13:11.279 the problem is he then has family and
00:13:14.079 people around him
00:13:15.200 that basically become lobbyists for
00:13:16.720 themselves and trump isn't really even
00:13:18.720 aware of it
00:13:19.519 and then that's going on and i mean even
00:13:21.279 junior aids now
00:13:22.720 you'll find out how people give in to
00:13:24.320 millions of dollars
00:13:25.760 just to say something to the president
00:13:27.200 is this standard [ __ ] is this just stan
00:13:29.440 how politics have always been done it's
00:13:30.880 just now we're seeing it well
00:13:32.720 it was standard let's say 200 years ago
00:13:34.399 that you'd go out for the wife or the
00:13:35.600 brother or or somebody that works at the
00:13:37.120 white house
00:13:37.760 it got organized the last hundred years
00:13:39.519 with lobbyists trump literally cut the
00:13:41.519 lobbyist off
00:13:42.480 but all it did was now make everyone
00:13:44.000 around him a lobbyist no they're not
00:13:45.600 officially a lobbyist how did he cut the
00:13:47.120 lobbyists off he just stopped meeting
00:13:48.639 with him and stopped and just said i
00:13:50.000 want briefings on what's going on i'll
00:13:51.279 decide
00:13:51.839 so that's why he pissed official
00:13:52.959 washington off not that he's even
00:13:54.720 perfect but that he actually became the
00:13:56.079 president
00:13:56.560 sort of making decisions himself instead
00:13:58.240 of having consortiums and lobbyists pay
00:14:00.160 him for policy
00:14:01.199 that's why he says bidens raise more
00:14:02.880 money than me of course i can call up
00:14:04.240 all
00:14:04.560 these companies they'll give me any
00:14:05.680 money i want but i gotta do what they
00:14:07.199 say but it would put him in a
00:14:08.320 compromised position yes but i'm being
00:14:10.240 honest about it the vacuum and
00:14:12.160 and the the blind spot is that then
00:14:15.279 everyone around him in his cabinet and
00:14:17.279 everyone that works there even down to
00:14:18.800 mid-level people
00:14:19.920 are now getting multi-million dollar
00:14:21.440 contracts for companies
00:14:23.120 like at t and stuff just to just to just
00:14:25.839 to even
00:14:26.720 mention something of the next hold up
00:14:28.240 before you any further you said att
00:14:30.240 has it been proven that it's a t or are
00:14:32.079 you just saying att
00:14:34.000 like companies like let's just say i'm
00:14:36.160 not saying atg is bad i think atg's
00:14:37.760 overall good company but is att doing
00:14:39.440 something bad
00:14:40.800 no i just i was mentioning that as a
00:14:42.800 fortune 500 company
00:14:44.160 okay but it's not 18t no it's not agency
00:14:46.399 so we shouldn't say that
00:14:47.839 see this is why you need someone that's
00:14:49.360 like a fact checker right now no
00:14:50.959 no slow down the media will say i'm
00:14:53.360 wrong
00:14:54.000 right about that but okay okay but no no
00:14:56.880 hold on his personal lawyer
00:14:58.800 his personal lawyer the one that ended
00:15:00.240 up going to jail actually michael cohen
00:15:02.560 michael cohen was getting money from att
00:15:04.480 go ahead and pull it up i mean i was
00:15:06.000 just trying to give you a gestalt
00:15:07.199 question
00:15:08.320 but i just want to i've told you before
00:15:10.399 what you really need on your show is
00:15:11.680 like a
00:15:12.160 a legit journalist who's right next to
00:15:14.079 you with a laptop going ah alex hold on
00:15:16.160 hold on
00:15:16.800 just slow down but i think you're right
00:15:18.240 about that because but you get so much
00:15:20.160 right but when you get something wrong
00:15:22.160 that's important
00:15:23.600 att confirms it paid trump lawyer
00:15:25.920 michael cohen's company
00:15:27.120 yeah now i remember that see joe yeah
00:15:29.600 they're always saying
00:15:30.720 that i'm making sure that they're lying
00:15:32.639 right right now every once in a while my
00:15:33.920 memory used to be photographic but from
00:15:35.279 everything i've done it's not as good as
00:15:36.399 it used to be
00:15:37.120 it moves really quick okay so what i'm
00:15:39.279 saying stuff is just
00:15:40.480 data knowledge okay and then i can like
00:15:42.240 okay yeah did i say that yeah it's real
00:15:44.000 check it out
00:15:44.800 but i'm not trying to make stuff up 99
00:15:46.720 of the time here it is att confirmed
00:15:48.399 tuesday evening that paid president
00:15:49.680 trump's personal loyal michael cohen
00:15:51.519 in 2017 for in quotes insights into
00:15:54.880 understanding the new administration
00:15:56.430 [Laughter]
00:15:58.639 insights i love that um so how much they
00:16:01.279 pay them 200 000 bucks and four separate
00:16:03.279 payments of 50 bucks
00:16:04.560 in late 2017 early 2018. interesting
00:16:07.360 yeah but he got paid i think the number
00:16:08.880 was 10 million total
00:16:10.480 from a a handful of companies but by the
00:16:12.639 way t
00:16:13.519 did it shady look avenatti alleged that
00:16:15.920 essential consultants a shell company
00:16:18.240 set up by cohen before the election to
00:16:20.480 pay stormy daniels was paid by several
00:16:22.880 corporations including
00:16:24.639 a t at the time att was seeking
00:16:27.600 government approval for its acquisition
00:16:29.519 of time warner cnn's parent company it's
00:16:32.639 a
00:16:33.040 dirty world yeah but i'm telling you at
00:16:35.600 t is a sweetheart compared to google
00:16:37.519 and facebook and twitter and all these
00:16:39.360 people so i wasn't attacking them
00:16:41.279 i was giving an example of how everyone
00:16:43.279 in his entourage
00:16:44.480 becomes a a lobbyist because he thinks
00:16:47.040 i'll just cut lobbyists off he's not
00:16:48.399 taking any money
00:16:49.600 and but then everyone around him becomes
00:16:51.360 a lobbyist that's why you worry about
00:16:52.560 the influence that people like jared
00:16:53.680 kushner have because i know
00:16:54.800 a lot of biggest uh his supporters again
00:16:56.959 coulter who's trump's biggest supporter
00:16:58.560 goes
00:16:59.040 i don't love the idea that he hired his
00:17:00.880 children and that they have a lot of
00:17:02.880 connections i can tell you this
00:17:04.319 i can tell you this people were really
00:17:06.400 pissed who were patriots the
00:17:07.839 intelligence community
00:17:09.199 in other areas but also enemies of trump
00:17:11.119 that kushner had so much influence
00:17:12.959 but now kushner's gotten a lot of
00:17:14.319 respect uh because he's actually gotten
00:17:16.240 a lot of huge peace deals done that
00:17:17.679 nobody
00:17:18.000 else could do for 50 years now
00:17:20.240 interesting how little press
00:17:21.760 those piece deals is they're getting
00:17:22.959 none press yeah it's really concerning
00:17:25.520 so so now i mean they were pissed like
00:17:27.039 who's this kid and now everything he
00:17:28.400 touches turns to gold but he looks like
00:17:30.240 the omen we've covered
00:17:31.360 he looks like a little little devil it's
00:17:32.640 just like yeah and he's paid he paid
00:17:34.720 twice what it was worth
00:17:36.080 for like 666 park avenue oh jesus christ
00:17:39.039 that's not good
00:17:40.000 that's not great wow that's not great
00:17:41.760 why would he want that
00:17:43.120 i think it was more than twice look up
00:17:45.200 666 is it park avenue or listen maybe he
00:17:47.600 says it's funny
00:17:48.400 maybe he's a satanist he's getting good
00:17:50.160 deals done in the middle east yeah i
00:17:51.440 mean
00:17:51.840 he's playing good deals they say the
00:17:53.440 antichrist gets good deals in the middle
00:17:54.799 east
00:17:55.200 if you're gonna be a luciferian at least
00:17:56.640 make peace in the middle east how about
00:17:58.240 that maybe satan's the only one that can
00:17:59.600 do that
00:18:00.080 att is a really good cell phone company
00:18:02.080 yeah right hey
00:18:03.120 hey just the way it works i mean you
00:18:04.799 wanna when i mentioned att it's an
00:18:07.280 example that popped in my head of an
00:18:09.360 unofficial lobby well i was happy that
00:18:11.200 we called you on it because then we
00:18:12.799 found out it's correct
00:18:14.160 yeah look you've been correct about a
00:18:15.840 lot of [ __ ] this is my point
00:18:17.440 from jump i found out about agent
00:18:20.320 provocateurs from you
00:18:21.600 from your 9 11 road to tyranny video
00:18:24.960 where they use them at the world trade
00:18:26.320 organization protests in seattle in the
00:18:27.919 late 90s
00:18:28.799 like i had no idea that it was a common
00:18:31.679 practice
00:18:32.559 to send in masked people to start
00:18:35.679 smashing things during peaceful protests
00:18:37.600 right so then they could go
00:18:39.360 i could give you the straight dope on
00:18:40.640 antifa you wanna do that go ahead
00:18:42.960 okay yeah hold on a second 666 park
00:18:45.919 cavity project
00:18:46.960 have been a black hole of cash for years
00:18:49.039 until a sovereign wealth fund made a
00:18:51.360 substantial investment for the property
00:18:53.120 after kushner
00:18:54.080 was already serving as trump's top
00:18:56.160 advisor in the white house
00:18:58.799 wow okay might be a nice building
00:19:01.919 though what does it say the kushner
00:19:03.520 company is that what is the company's
00:19:04.880 yeah
00:19:07.039 the kushner company's 666 park avenue
00:19:09.520 project
00:19:10.160 that's hilarious i think that's
00:19:12.000 beautiful his dad went to prison for
00:19:13.760 i believe setting up his brother with
00:19:16.000 like a prostitute
00:19:17.039 yeah yeah what yeah that's they're a fun
00:19:19.520 family the customer wait a minute wait
00:19:20.960 wait the dad set up the brother with a
00:19:23.840 with a prostitute with a call
00:19:24.880 okay step by step we're going to
00:19:28.240 fact check every one of those no no no
00:19:29.440 this is well known
00:19:31.280 but we need to have this for the people
00:19:32.720 like me and alex don't you spout off
00:19:34.480 i have the facts i know you have the
00:19:36.000 facts but i want to make sure chris
00:19:38.080 christie jared kushner's father
00:19:39.919 committed one of the most loathsome
00:19:41.600 disgusting crimes i prosecuted wow
00:19:45.039 wow we fact check all of that is crazy
00:19:48.480 make that bigger for my old eyes look at
00:19:50.840 this
00:19:52.000 what does it say according to the ex
00:19:53.760 purpose in the book were published by
00:19:55.280 axios and the guardian
00:19:56.400 christie claims the younger kushner was
00:19:58.000 behind his departure from trump's inner
00:19:59.600 circle
00:20:00.160 after 2016 election writing that he was
00:20:02.400 still apparently seething over the
00:20:04.320 events that had occurred a decade ago
00:20:06.240 well what is the events of a decade ago
00:20:08.320 they over prosecuted his dad he should
00:20:09.840 have gotten like
00:20:10.640 uh he should have gotten probation for
00:20:12.080 trying to set up his brother with a
00:20:13.120 hooker said he got a bunch of time
00:20:14.799 imagine your dad setting you up with a
00:20:16.559 hooker it's crazy he's
00:20:18.000 trying to shut the other family member
00:20:19.440 up here's here's what uh
00:20:21.760 if my father is guilty i would mr
00:20:24.000 kutcher pled guilty
00:20:25.200 he admitted the crimes christy said and
00:20:27.200 so what am i supposed to do as a
00:20:28.400 prosecutor i mean if a guy hires a
00:20:30.240 prostitute seduced to sue
00:20:32.000 his brother-in-law oh it's his
00:20:33.120 brother-in-law what he said his
00:20:34.640 brother-in-law his brother-in-law
00:20:36.080 okay i got confused and then videotapes
00:20:38.799 it and then
00:20:39.360 sends the videotape to his sister to
00:20:41.840 attempt to intimidate her from
00:20:43.120 testifying before a grand jury
00:20:44.799 do i really need any more justification
00:20:46.400 than that holy [ __ ] but it wasn't to
00:20:48.159 intimidate that's his interpretation
00:20:49.840 that stuff goes on divorces all the time
00:20:52.000 people go videotape the other person
00:20:53.520 cheating so
00:20:54.240 that's why it was wrong he went to
00:20:55.600 prison because he wasn't doing it he was
00:20:57.600 doing that to show that the person
00:20:58.960 testifying was wrong
00:21:00.080 of course you're trying to influence
00:21:01.200 testimony with the truth it's this idea
00:21:03.200 that
00:21:03.600 yes they're cheating i told you they
00:21:05.760 were here's the proof how does that
00:21:07.039 become
00:21:07.679 fraud okay i'm confused so he set up his
00:21:10.360 brother-in-law
00:21:11.840 with a prostitute to show that this was
00:21:14.400 been going on before which he'd already
00:21:15.520 alleged
00:21:16.960 okay as part of the plot kushner hired a
00:21:18.960 prostitute to lure
00:21:20.400 shoulder into having sex in a
00:21:22.480 bridgewater new jersey motel first of
00:21:24.240 all if you find yourself in a
00:21:25.200 bridgewater new jersey motel you're
00:21:26.720 [ __ ]
00:21:28.840 run as the hidden camera rolls
00:21:31.679 a tape of the encounter was then sent to
00:21:33.360 kushner's sister
00:21:34.799 and uh shoulders i know the whole story
00:21:37.440 so
00:21:37.919 just trust us we try we're just i just
00:21:40.320 made a comment that
00:21:41.840 you start thinking about like who's
00:21:42.960 running the [ __ ] these stories and
00:21:44.640 hunter biden's running around with
00:21:46.320 you know underage people on the laptop
00:21:47.840 you start going why does everyone work
00:21:49.440 for ukrainian gas company like
00:21:51.280 who are these people running the country
00:21:52.960 the west controlled ukraine so they just
00:21:54.960 use that
00:21:55.600 as as the money laundering off it's not
00:21:57.440 the ukrainians running right
00:21:58.880 they use it as that but let's expand on
00:22:00.640 this joe what i'm getting at here is
00:22:03.360 i didn't bring up att they're a good
00:22:05.120 company overall they're not the one
00:22:06.320 censoring and stuff
00:22:07.280 okay it's the big tech the reason i
00:22:10.000 raised that was just the one that popped
00:22:11.120 my head the first one
00:22:12.480 it's massive what's going on i was just
00:22:13.840 being honest that trump's trying to get
00:22:15.360 a couple hundred grand
00:22:16.640 like i mean as much as that sounds like
00:22:18.400 a lot of money but the bigger ones like
00:22:19.760 he's talking about communist china yeah
00:22:21.280 amazon
00:22:21.840 communist china is even bigger it's
00:22:23.520 bigger than big tech it literally spends
00:22:25.200 hundreds of billions of dollars buying
00:22:26.640 us off it owns hollywood
00:22:28.320 it owns a lot of the big telecoms it
00:22:30.559 owns the majority of our debt
00:22:32.080 and i've got articles in the la times
00:22:33.840 and new york times i brought for you
00:22:35.280 where they say xi ji ping must destroy
00:22:37.440 trump to save america
00:22:39.360 he was our leader and then at the davos
00:22:41.360 group he said three years ago i will
00:22:42.880 destroy trump
00:22:43.840 i will work with hollywood i've got all
00:22:45.280 his quotes right here and jiji pink said
00:22:47.280 i want to overthrow american democracy
00:22:49.280 i want to repudiate it i want to
00:22:50.799 discredit it and gigi ping admits he
00:22:52.720 admires adolf hitler
00:22:54.480 and joseph stalin okay but isn't he
00:22:57.440 doing that
00:22:58.080 because that seems crazy yeah you can
00:23:00.159 pull it up i understand i'll show you
00:23:02.080 step by step isn't he doing that because
00:23:05.280 it trumps trade deals
00:23:06.880 like the trade deals that trump wants to
00:23:08.880 do with china
00:23:09.919 are not nearly well they're not
00:23:11.200 one-sided for for him here's what
00:23:12.960 happened
00:23:13.679 special interest in the u.s went in and
00:23:15.120 opened up china you know in the 70s when
00:23:17.760 most of them didn't have running water
00:23:18.880 or electricity
00:23:19.760 they're hard working smart folks but by
00:23:21.520 one sided trade deals where we
00:23:23.600 we have higher tariffs on them and they
00:23:25.039 on us and all the rest of it are vice
00:23:26.480 versa
00:23:27.360 through those deals they use the slave
00:23:29.840 labor of china to then take over
00:23:31.360 manufacturing worldwide
00:23:32.880 and so china's a client state of the
00:23:34.640 globalist and so now
00:23:37.280 the washington post the la times the new
00:23:39.440 york times i brought you the articles
00:23:40.799 here
00:23:41.440 dreams of red emperor the relentless
00:23:43.360 rise of xi ji ping and it says
00:23:45.360 in these articles he must destroy
00:23:47.679 american western christian values we
00:23:49.679 love him
00:23:50.559 and we accept china as our master i have
00:23:52.880 the goddamn articles
00:23:53.840 but this is treason the freaking dude
00:23:55.760 right here washington post
00:23:57.760 uh but who's saying that quote who's
00:23:59.679 that quote here i'll give them to you
00:24:01.039 this is this is the washington post
00:24:02.880 and there's a huge article la times i
00:24:04.640 understand but the quote that you just
00:24:06.000 said about he must destroy
00:24:07.600 just like i said at t gave money
00:24:10.640 unofficially lobbying and you pulled it
00:24:12.000 up
00:24:12.400 i read the article i'm not giving you
00:24:13.520 that i understand what you're saying but
00:24:14.880 what i'm what i'm asking you is who
00:24:16.400 you quoted someone but who did you quote
00:24:18.480 when you said that i'm quoting
00:24:20.080 from when i read these again this
00:24:21.200 morning before i came here what i
00:24:22.799 remember
00:24:23.600 david don durie durley oh that guy
00:24:27.760 and and uh this this chinese lady i
00:24:30.799 think he's talking about the prevailing
00:24:32.240 sentiment of what they
00:24:33.520 feel they must understand but you quote
00:24:35.200 somebody it's best no no no no no no
00:24:36.960 i just said in these articles right well
00:24:39.440 look at the headline
00:24:40.320 g's choice destroy trump or save them
00:24:42.559 from weakened america i mean
00:24:44.240 right she needs to destroy trump the
00:24:46.640 chinese dictator needs to destroy our
00:24:48.080 president so do you think that they're
00:24:49.840 doing that because
00:24:51.120 trump wants to change the trade deals
00:24:53.279 you know what trump said trump didn't
00:24:54.480 start a trade war he ended our surrender
00:24:56.799 we have been surrendered for 40 years
00:24:59.520 with china
00:25:00.480 where they don't take our goods but we
00:25:02.240 take all of theirs and they manipulate
00:25:04.159 their currency but we haven't
00:25:05.600 manipulated ours where we have carbon
00:25:07.360 taxes that obama put in
00:25:08.799 to shut down over half our coal plants
00:25:10.400 that are clean and our electricity
00:25:12.080 prices went up where you could not run a
00:25:13.679 factory here
00:25:14.320 competitively against china so when joe
00:25:16.240 biden says we're going to cut off all
00:25:17.760 the fossil fuels not just fracking right
00:25:19.600 if you did that we wouldn't just go
00:25:21.440 bankrupt we'd start to death
00:25:22.880 75 of our power comes from fossil fuels
00:25:25.520 i understand
00:25:26.159 let's step by step again are coal plants
00:25:28.880 really clean
00:25:29.679 100 percent clean how is that possible
00:25:31.600 i'll tell you please okay
00:25:32.960 there's two different types of major
00:25:34.159 power when they say when he says clean
00:25:35.760 coal i roll my eyes every time
00:25:37.440 when trump's like clean coal clean well
00:25:39.760 that's because the engine is
00:25:41.039 so damn good is it i'll tell you please
00:25:45.360 they had old-fashioned coal plants china
00:25:47.279 doesn't have one scrubber or filter on
00:25:49.520 their coal power plants
00:25:51.039 and china doesn't have clean burning
00:25:52.720 coal there's one place in the united
00:25:54.400 states that has major deposits of coal
00:25:56.240 that is such pure carbon you don't even
00:25:58.320 need scrubbers
00:25:59.840 nothing comes out but carbon dioxide and
00:26:01.600 water well they know we know water is
00:26:03.520 not bad so they list carbon
00:26:04.960 dioxide people think it's monoxide just
00:26:07.360 like in studies if you say
00:26:09.039 the scientific name of water most people
00:26:10.960 in penn teller skits on the street will
00:26:12.960 say ban dihydrogen monoxide
00:26:14.880 if you go out on the street joe rogan
00:26:16.400 and ask 100 austenites
00:26:18.799 dihydrogen monoxide is everywhere if you
00:26:20.640 get too much of it you can die
00:26:21.919 ground and most people will say i want a
00:26:24.159 band of hydrogen monoxide that's the
00:26:25.520 scientific name of water
00:26:27.679 same thing if you do the scientific name
00:26:28.799 assault sounds scary well
00:26:31.200 so so hydrogen monoxide
00:26:34.320 is the bad one hydrogen dioxide is a
00:26:36.159 good one that's the life cycle
00:26:38.000 on earth there's there's light there's
00:26:40.240 water there's
00:26:41.520 oxygen and there's carbon dioxide those
00:26:43.520 are the four things you've got to have
00:26:44.799 for
00:26:45.279 for life and so they've gotten people
00:26:47.520 convinced
00:26:48.320 to say coal is dirty it puts out carbon
00:26:50.880 dioxide and water vapor
00:26:53.039 and so until about the 70s we were still
00:26:55.679 burning
00:26:56.159 dirty coal full of mercury all of they
00:26:58.159 found huge deposits
00:26:59.360 of clean burning coal out west enough in
00:27:02.320 utah around the whole world for over a
00:27:03.600 thousand years
00:27:04.640 what's the difference between the coal
00:27:06.000 like well let me tell you okay please
00:27:07.440 one coal is so damn pure and it's only
00:27:09.120 in the united states and major deposits
00:27:11.039 that basically you don't need to put
00:27:12.320 scrubbers on it but our scientists in
00:27:14.320 the 40s 50s 60s and 70s
00:27:16.240 because they realize that dirty coal has
00:27:17.679 mercury in it has all these horrible
00:27:19.200 toxins they put scrubbers on it that's
00:27:20.799 when you drive by a coal plant it's just
00:27:22.159 big huge buildings and
00:27:23.600 wires and and hoses and big huge steel
00:27:26.399 looks like an alien spaceship
00:27:27.919 that's because it's called distillates
00:27:29.279 they know how to burn it and then take
00:27:30.960 off all the chemicals all the toxins and
00:27:32.559 make plastics and make chemicals and
00:27:34.159 make pesticides
00:27:35.120 and make everything else that comes out
00:27:36.880 of that and then out of the stack
00:27:39.120 comes nothing but water sensors on it
00:27:41.200 nothing but water and carbon dioxide
00:27:43.360 totally clean totally pure so so that's
00:27:46.480 what's going on
00:27:47.440 so carbon monoxide is what everybody's
00:27:49.919 worried about
00:27:50.559 carbon dioxide increasing and the
00:27:52.960 environment has
00:27:54.080 no negative effects let's talk about it
00:27:56.080 they've done they've done ice core
00:27:57.679 samples
00:27:58.320 okay all over the antarctic and the
00:28:00.320 arctic they've done mud core samples uh
00:28:02.399 in in
00:28:03.840 all over the world but mainly in siberia
00:28:05.760 and whales for some reason jamie i hope
00:28:07.440 you're googling
00:28:08.080 i i haven't got some decent stuff to
00:28:10.159 pull up but he's
00:28:11.120 got yeah better right now so so so what
00:28:13.840 happens is
00:28:15.679 they they can go back twenty thousand a
00:28:17.440 hundred thousand two hundred thousand
00:28:18.640 years at least in the ice
00:28:20.159 and they know that they've also done
00:28:22.159 spectrometers in the stone
00:28:23.600 they can scan until it was there carbon
00:28:25.919 dioxide was over 500 times
00:28:28.320 stronger in the time of the t-rex okay
00:28:31.760 in the jurassic age that's why plants
00:28:33.840 grew so fast things were so big
00:28:35.520 there was a higher oxygen level just
00:28:37.440 like mars lost its atmosphere
00:28:39.120 used to have an ocean they've now gone
00:28:40.480 and proven it lost its atmosphere as a
00:28:42.640 smaller planet couldn't hold it truth is
00:28:44.320 the earth's losing its atmosphere
00:28:45.919 so what's crazy is we come right along
00:28:47.760 at this time pump up all
00:28:49.520 of this juice and all this carbon that
00:28:51.679 was produced on the surface with plants
00:28:53.279 and animals that ran down and cracks
00:28:54.799 into the earth
00:28:55.760 we're now pumping out all that carbon
00:28:57.840 saved for millions years ago
00:28:59.279 and actually terraforming the planet
00:29:01.039 putting more carbon dioxide in that we
00:29:02.720 actually need
00:29:03.520 right this time like aliens figure this
00:29:05.200 out but hold please but hold please
00:29:07.360 isn't carbon dioxide responsible for an
00:29:10.480 increase in the temperature of the earth
00:29:12.320 but they said that we would have a seven
00:29:14.399 increase they said that by 2013 all that
00:29:16.799 la would be flooded and new york would
00:29:18.000 be flooded all that's lies
00:29:19.360 okay but let's forget about what they
00:29:20.880 said in the past what they're saying
00:29:22.720 now is that carbon dioxide increase
00:29:26.320 is responsible for an increase in the
00:29:28.960 temperature of the earth which which
00:29:30.480 which we hope it does
00:29:32.000 because we hope it increases the
00:29:33.200 temperature the last ice age
00:29:35.279 hold up but hold on but the increase in
00:29:38.880 the temperature of the earth is
00:29:39.760 responsible for the increase in
00:29:41.039 hurricanes
00:29:41.919 the frequency and the power of the
00:29:43.360 hurricanes if you look up this
00:29:45.360 the spectrum in the last hundred years
00:29:46.960 hurricanes have gotten weaker that's all
00:29:48.799 media hype but let me just tell you
00:29:50.320 oh jesus joe joe joe i swear to god i
00:29:53.279 swear to god i can prove all this to you
00:29:54.640 this is so easy for your audience
00:29:56.159 are you a carbon dioxide salesman listen
00:29:58.880 well they always say i'm getting my
00:29:59.919 world companies i'm not
00:30:00.960 but can i please tell you what's going
00:30:02.320 on yes please do
00:30:04.399 you are a carbon-based life-form let me
00:30:06.640 show you what i came here with in my
00:30:08.159 notes
00:30:09.760 i have right here in my notes the
00:30:13.039 carbon conspiracy and that is
00:30:15.360 specifically
00:30:16.720 what i wanted to get into here with you
00:30:19.679 in my notes because this is
00:30:21.039 everything are you a climate change
00:30:22.399 denier well see imagine
00:30:24.159 imagine how that's how they use that
00:30:25.520 term right are you a climate change
00:30:27.360 denier it's like a 911 denier right no
00:30:29.360 the towers got blown up
00:30:30.880 our government had prior warning and
00:30:32.480 have been funding al-qaeda and all that
00:30:33.919 came out later in senate reports
00:30:35.520 and the 28 let's not go there just now
00:30:37.279 because we're going to go down around
00:30:38.240 that
00:30:38.559 that's true but let's go to carbon i
00:30:40.399 have that that agree with you there okay
00:30:42.080 what are you what is what is what is
00:30:43.600 what is joe rogan made up out of
00:30:45.679 carbon okay-based life-forms we are
00:30:48.080 literally stardust
00:30:49.120 what are your song right exactly what
00:30:50.480 are trees made out of um
00:30:52.500 [Music]
00:30:53.840 tree stuff carbon carbon yeah but
00:30:56.240 carbon-based life forms it's mostly the
00:30:57.679 whole planet and so
00:30:59.200 this is the carbon cycle this is in the
00:31:00.880 mainline textbooks i understand
00:31:02.559 so so just like they they they come out
00:31:04.480 and assault reality now and say
00:31:06.080 a little boy is biologically a girl i
00:31:08.240 don't care if he grows up once being say
00:31:09.679 he's a girl rabbit hole let's not go
00:31:11.120 down
00:31:11.440 but i'm saying it's not science they go
00:31:13.120 the science is settled there's not two
00:31:14.559 genders
00:31:16.320 okay hold on let's not go down that road
00:31:18.240 will you want to go to that road in the
00:31:19.679 future we will
00:31:20.640 right now i'll do it let me just i want
00:31:22.320 you to talk about carbon i don't know i
00:31:23.840 don't want to get off track
00:31:24.960 because isn't there a delicate balance
00:31:27.279 with the temperature on earth and the
00:31:28.799 rising sea levels and the melting of the
00:31:30.640 ice caps
00:31:31.440 this has all been established by a lot
00:31:33.279 of they say they say the science is
00:31:35.039 settled
00:31:36.080 but very concerned environmentalists
00:31:38.559 have said that an increase in the
00:31:40.159 temperature of the earth could be
00:31:41.360 disastrous
00:31:42.159 power civilization power grab are you
00:31:44.080 sure it's a power grid i'm absolutely
00:31:45.600 freaking literally but how do you how do
00:31:46.880 you know that it's not
00:31:48.080 all how do you know that because they're
00:31:50.159 arrogant and they've all written white
00:31:51.519 papers on it that i've read and i can
00:31:52.720 give you
00:31:53.760 white papers yeah it's not what you see
00:31:55.840 in the news they're called white papers
00:31:58.080 and joe just like joe this is why people
00:32:01.039 get banned
00:32:02.399 from the internet this this these kind
00:32:04.320 of conversations
00:32:05.679 we better ban it right now let's not ban
00:32:08.399 it
00:32:08.799 i'm just not i'm throwing that out let's
00:32:10.559 just certainly not bend the don't
00:32:12.080 listen to new zealand fantastic by the
00:32:15.120 way
00:32:15.360 what your youtube page thank you let me
00:32:16.799 tell you this right now
00:32:18.399 it'll be up for another day they have
00:32:19.600 called in the european union
00:32:21.440 for the arrest of scientists that
00:32:24.320 question
00:32:25.200 the cause of anthropogenic warming or
00:32:28.080 image man-made
00:32:29.279 okay but there is a contributing factor
00:32:32.159 scientifically
00:32:33.279 it's been proven that increased carbon
00:32:35.279 dioxide
00:32:36.320 has an effect on the temperature of the
00:32:38.240 earth do you agree with that
00:32:40.399 it depends on the models they use
00:32:42.240 sometimes actually more carbon dioxide
00:32:44.000 can cause a cooling effect but generally
00:32:45.519 could cause a
00:32:46.240 heating effect it depends on potash the
00:32:48.000 atmosphere volcanic
00:32:49.919 ejections at the time and also solar
00:32:52.000 maximum and many
00:32:53.600 minimums sunspot activity is the main
00:32:55.840 generator of planetary
00:32:57.120 climate but the wide if you had a a
00:33:00.399 giant swath of scientists that are
00:33:02.320 examining
00:33:03.120 carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would
00:33:05.039 you agree that the majority of them
00:33:07.200 believe that it's a contributing factor
00:33:08.799 to warming
00:33:09.600 joe it's a mantra where they say the
00:33:11.840 majority of scientists agree
00:33:13.519 that climate change is caused by humans
00:33:15.600 i agree with climate change
00:33:17.440 the only thing that's constant is change
00:33:19.120 of course the climate's changing
00:33:20.480 what i'm telling you is carbon dioxide
00:33:23.679 was
00:33:24.000 50 to 500 times depending on the time
00:33:26.640 period
00:33:27.760 higher millions of years ago yes it is
00:33:30.320 now right but that's
00:33:31.120 but you also realize that that was what
00:33:32.720 we got hit by now here
00:33:34.399 what do you think the motivation is for
00:33:36.720 them to present the evidence in this way
00:33:38.880 like you said this is a fraud and
00:33:40.720 everything what because i've heard you
00:33:42.799 talk about this before
00:33:44.320 um what do you think their goal is by
00:33:47.360 linking all of this climate change to
00:33:49.279 man-made activity
00:33:50.559 what's the goal the goal is to
00:33:52.799 centralize world government that can
00:33:54.159 then monitor all carbon and control it
00:33:56.320 as a toxic bad thing
00:33:57.600 your carbon it makes you bad that didn't
00:33:59.440 work so now it's oh you have a cold
00:34:01.440 you're dirty with covent we've got to
00:34:03.120 track you and control you so the new
00:34:05.200 thing is covered to cut the carbon
00:34:06.799 footprint
00:34:07.760 before we go down the covert rabbit hole
00:34:09.599 there the environmentalists are not
00:34:12.399 in bed with the industrialists the
00:34:14.320 environmentalists are
00:34:15.839 they're not in bed with all these people
00:34:17.918 that think that they can
00:34:19.520 control the the world actually bp and
00:34:22.239 exxon mobil and others the biggest
00:34:23.520 funders of the climate change movement
00:34:26.079 they're the biggest funders of it
00:34:27.599 contrary to what you hear how so
00:34:29.918 all right joe here's the thing i
00:34:31.760 understand this is and you're a smart
00:34:33.119 guy
00:34:33.599 and i understand you want to go over
00:34:34.719 each piece of this let's go through well
00:34:36.159 we have to we have to agree let's go
00:34:37.760 through each piece but but understand
00:34:38.960 you understand that the way you talk
00:34:40.719 and i enjoy the way you talk fast but
00:34:42.159 the way you talk is fast and you go on
00:34:43.760 these long tangents
00:34:45.040 and you go to frogs being gay and a lot
00:34:47.199 of things happen
00:34:48.239 i wanted people i'm putting a record out
00:34:50.639 yes but i want to do it step by step
00:34:52.320 let's do this let's do this let's do
00:34:53.679 this but most people the vast majority
00:34:55.918 here we got here
00:34:56.719 bp commits 100 million to fund new
00:34:59.440 emissions reductions projects
00:35:02.160 well let me just go back for a second
00:35:03.359 okay i appreciate you backing me up yes
00:35:07.359 let me break down are frogs gay
00:35:12.800 you want to get to the frog stuff now
00:35:15.200 connect it all
00:35:16.160 that is by the way why do i feel like
00:35:17.520 i'm stoned and i haven't smoked me pot
00:35:18.800 yeah i
00:35:19.359 wish if he's not gonna smoke it i'm
00:35:20.800 gonna god it's sober october i have
00:35:22.640 six break the goddamn rule and then go
00:35:24.720 an extra day i cannot
00:35:26.000 i cannot i'm like george washington well
00:35:27.920 on election night we're gonna get
00:35:28.880 hammered right mm-hmm
00:35:30.800 election night i'm getting hammered but
00:35:32.480 you're gonna i'm gonna pop in
00:35:33.839 you'll you can pop in but we've told
00:35:35.760 everybody now that we're doing a live
00:35:36.880 stream no no we're not
00:35:38.320 kyle yeah kyle kalinski that's tim
00:35:40.560 dillon yeah
00:35:41.920 me al shawn's gonna pop in live it's
00:35:44.320 gonna be fun
00:35:44.960 it's live so while you're watching the
00:35:46.640 world burn live
00:35:48.079 yeah all right joe here's the here's the
00:35:49.680 thing it's just like
00:35:52.000 at least funny to you because i love you
00:35:53.599 dude it's just like when you said what's
00:35:55.040 the att deal and i went oh look it up
00:35:57.599 but but listen we did look it up and we
00:35:59.520 found this is information this is bigger
00:36:01.359 okay
00:36:02.000 let me let me get my brain focused here
00:36:03.440 for a minute let me just try to explain
00:36:06.320 i've literally interviewed probably
00:36:08.400 sound exaggerate 200 top scientists
00:36:10.800 from petroleum geologists
00:36:12.680 astrophysicists
00:36:13.839 to astronauts to quantum mechanics
00:36:17.280 to petroleum buckle up because i have
00:36:19.119 two i know [ __ ] i know
00:36:20.640 okay you're a [ __ ] yeah they're not
00:36:22.800 yeah trust me
00:36:23.680 joe you're a smart guy and i'm not
00:36:25.200 that's his cover he is smart
00:36:27.280 oh yeah right yeah yeah right i'm a
00:36:29.760 smart [ __ ]
00:36:30.640 yeah right okay let me tell you what's
00:36:32.320 going on i'm going to say it again
00:36:34.880 you can go to any major study just type
00:36:37.920 in
00:36:39.040 carbon dioxide levels were hundreds of
00:36:41.359 times
00:36:42.160 higher in earth's early past well i
00:36:44.960 understand that but also i understand
00:36:47.680 you can look at the ocean models then
00:36:49.280 yes even with the ocean models right
00:36:51.359 and it's true the oceans did cover more
00:36:53.200 than it is jones human beings weren't
00:36:55.040 alive 65 million years ago and
00:36:56.720 the environment wasn't compatible for us
00:36:58.640 we put out a fraction well we hadn't
00:37:00.079 developed yet
00:37:00.880 right well we were moles we had yeah
00:37:03.760 shroosh
00:37:04.320 shrews yeah but my point is you're right
00:37:06.560 yeah is that is that
00:37:09.200 last time co2 was this high humans
00:37:11.040 didn't exist the last time there's as
00:37:13.040 much carbon dioxide
00:37:14.720 co2 in the earth co2 levels are far
00:37:17.280 higher now than they have been for any
00:37:18.640 time during the past
00:37:19.920 and oil a single co2 milk who can re
00:37:23.599 remain in the atmosphere what'd you do
00:37:26.880 oh i see i understand oh okay okay um
00:37:30.079 so let's let's just go to what this says
00:37:31.760 and what is this uh paper that's uh
00:37:33.520 is this a climate central.org okay
00:37:37.040 the last time there was this much carbon
00:37:38.480 dioxide that earth's atmospheric modern
00:37:39.920 humans didn't exist
00:37:41.040 mega two sharks probably oceans blah
00:37:43.200 blah blah all right
00:37:44.320 we as we near the record for the
00:37:47.440 highest co2 concentrations in human
00:37:49.599 history 400 parts per million
00:37:51.280 climate scientists worry about what
00:37:54.640 where about excuse me about where we
00:37:57.040 were then
00:37:58.079 and where we're rapidly headed now
00:38:00.800 according to the data gathered by
00:38:03.760 loa observatory in hawaii dope spot the
00:38:06.640 400
00:38:07.520 ppm mark may briefly be exceeded this
00:38:10.640 month when co2 typically hits a seasonal
00:38:12.720 peak
00:38:13.200 sure and i've had scientists on i've had
00:38:15.280 climatologists talking about the keeling
00:38:16.640 curve i can tell you all this threshold
00:38:18.000 according to ralph keeling the
00:38:18.960 researcher
00:38:21.040 carbon dioxide is the most important
00:38:22.720 long-lived global warming gas
00:38:25.200 and once it's emitted by burning fossil
00:38:27.839 fuels it helps us
00:38:28.880 keep our atmosphere hold please hold
00:38:30.839 please but once it's emitted by burning
00:38:33.520 fossil fuels such as coal
00:38:35.200 and oil a single co2 molecule can remain
00:38:38.160 in the atmosphere for hundreds of years
00:38:40.160 global co2 emissions reached a record
00:38:42.720 high
00:38:43.200 of 35.6 billion tons in 2002
00:38:46.560 excuse me 2012 up 2.6 from 2011 carbon
00:38:50.160 dioxide and other greenhouse gases warm
00:38:51.839 the planet
00:38:52.480 by absorbing the sun's energy and
00:38:54.079 preventing heat from escaping back into
00:38:55.760 space
00:38:56.240 which means it enhances the atmosphere
00:38:58.320 right but the sea levels didn't go like
00:38:59.599 they said
00:39:01.040 well aren't they melting but it's a al
00:39:03.760 gore said by 2013
00:39:05.599 al gore okay joe but listen this is one
00:39:08.480 guy's take
00:39:09.680 brother out there flying around i know
00:39:11.520 you found a guy admitting that used to
00:39:12.960 be higher than it is now
00:39:14.079 i'm telling you it used to be way higher
00:39:16.079 than it is now this is
00:39:17.599 right but then the asteroid hit the
00:39:19.119 yucatan killed all the dinosaurs and
00:39:20.960 changed the entire atmosphere
00:39:22.320 i don't want to of the planet with a
00:39:23.760 dark winter yeah which is
00:39:25.440 very bad for everything caused by
00:39:26.880 atmospheric dust for a long [ __ ] time
00:39:29.520 one major volcano like mount st helens
00:39:32.000 they estimated
00:39:32.800 put out more dust than decades of human
00:39:35.359 uh
00:39:36.000 dust yes and and human dust is what
00:39:38.560 helps cause nuclei to form to cause
00:39:40.240 storms so we are affecting our
00:39:41.520 environment but most of the
00:39:42.480 astrophysicists
00:39:43.520 and most of the physicists i've talked
00:39:44.800 to most of climatologists i've talked to
00:39:47.280 they have broken down that the sun by
00:39:49.520 magnitude
00:39:50.880 is 98 of the driver
00:39:54.079 of what happens that's why when the sun
00:39:55.599 spots take place that's an
00:39:57.119 a uh huronal ejection from the sun
00:40:00.800 and one of those shoots radiation in our
00:40:02.640 direction it'll be clear blue sky but
00:40:04.560 but they know
00:40:05.280 when we get hit by that it hits our
00:40:07.280 magnetic field
00:40:08.400 and causes an ionization of the
00:40:10.000 atmosphere and electrification of it and
00:40:12.000 so that causes the giant storms
00:40:14.319 so the main driver of climate is the sun
00:40:16.400 and i think everybody
00:40:17.440 didn't be a scientist to know what's the
00:40:19.200 main thing that earth
00:40:21.040 living off of the sun the sun and so and
00:40:23.760 so they're telling us that carbon
00:40:24.960 dioxide does this
00:40:26.480 what happens is carbon dioxide goes up
00:40:28.800 they said can
00:40:29.680 be in the atmosphere for hundreds of
00:40:30.880 years it's normally absorbed by plants
00:40:32.880 immediately
00:40:33.760 who they've got studies they have found
00:40:36.400 giant crocodile skeletons from just 10
00:40:38.480 000 years ago
00:40:39.760 in the central sahara where hundreds of
00:40:42.240 square miles
00:40:43.040 is nothing but dunes ten thousand years
00:40:45.359 ago it was
00:40:46.319 it was lush jungles and beautiful but
00:40:49.040 they had goats
00:40:50.400 and they ate all of the plants and well
00:40:52.720 there's also the younger driest theory
00:40:55.359 of asteroid impacts that they they ended
00:40:58.000 the ice age
00:40:59.280 12 000 years ago yeah ten well two
00:41:01.440 impacts i believe there's 12 and then
00:41:03.760 somewhere but the answer is we don't
00:41:06.000 know and and so they've now looked at
00:41:07.760 all these big models
00:41:09.280 saying it's all carbon dioxide and it's
00:41:11.599 not it's the sun
00:41:12.720 it's asteroids it's tectonic it's
00:41:14.400 electromagnetic from the earth's core
00:41:16.240 yes
00:41:16.560 but isn't co2 emissions the one thing
00:41:19.280 that we can control
00:41:20.880 so human-created global warming gases
00:41:24.079 like co2 emissions if we can put a cap
00:41:26.400 on that
00:41:27.040 wouldn't you agree let me ask you a
00:41:28.160 question we don't but if we continue
00:41:30.240 to put that stuff in the atmosphere and
00:41:32.160 it continues to get higher and higher
00:41:34.000 and higher levels of co2 in the
00:41:35.359 atmosphere wouldn't it that's going to
00:41:36.800 make it's going to make
00:41:37.839 the studies show it's going to make
00:41:39.680 deserts become green again
00:41:41.520 and plants are going to absorb the
00:41:42.800 carbon what studies are these
00:41:45.119 you can look them up okay let's find out
00:41:46.880 and that's why the left even says
00:41:48.400 but if you're going to say something
00:41:49.359 like that and i'm not arguing with you
00:41:51.440 but if you are going to say something
00:41:52.800 like that
00:41:53.440 that's that's a very bold thing to say
00:41:55.520 you should probably
00:41:56.640 not just say look them up there should
00:41:58.079 be something let's type it in let's type
00:41:59.599 in there's hundreds of them
00:42:01.200 like actually brought like over 250
00:42:02.720 articles right here do you have
00:42:04.160 something that you've read that makes
00:42:05.680 you so confident that you can say this
00:42:07.359 uh i actually know what what what the
00:42:09.280 plant studies show
00:42:10.480 where in greenhouses they grow plants
00:42:12.960 with hybrid
00:42:13.680 higher carbon dioxide and plants can
00:42:15.599 grow up to three times faster
00:42:17.440 they live longer of course plants let's
00:42:19.599 expand carbon dioxide what do they put
00:42:21.200 out more
00:42:21.680 oxygen well this one thing that has been
00:42:23.440 proven is there's more plants
00:42:25.280 now than there have been at a long
00:42:27.040 phosphorus there's a global greening
00:42:28.240 happening yes
00:42:29.119 countering us losing our atmosphere up
00:42:31.440 until this point
00:42:32.720 the earth has less atmosphere than it
00:42:34.319 did a million years ago and it's like
00:42:36.319 god did this or something where we
00:42:37.680 discovered all this oil which is blind
00:42:39.599 luck that we are terraforming the planet
00:42:41.760 back
00:42:42.160 to an earlier healthier state by taking
00:42:44.240 ancient carbon
00:42:45.280 that was under the ground and putting it
00:42:46.880 back into the atmosphere but isn't the
00:42:48.800 problem that
00:42:49.599 along the way we're also increasing the
00:42:51.359 temperature of the planet and we are not
00:42:53.200 aligned with a higher temperature
00:42:56.560 we don't know we don't know but in 1963
00:42:59.760 the club of rome came up with a limits
00:43:01.359 to growth plan and they had models and
00:43:03.599 actuaries and i have copies of this in
00:43:05.280 my film end game
00:43:06.079 seminal film it's free online in-game
00:43:08.079 blooper global enslavement predicts a
00:43:09.599 virus released to lock things down
00:43:11.119 everything's still happening
00:43:12.000 because it's their own documents and in
00:43:15.040 in the 1963 limits to growth club of
00:43:17.040 rome plan they said we believe there'll
00:43:18.720 be a global ice age
00:43:20.319 by 2020 because the last ice age ended
00:43:23.200 about 12
00:43:23.760 000 years ago and we're set for that
00:43:25.599 we're going to tell the public
00:43:27.040 that actually carbon dioxide in the
00:43:29.599 atmosphere
00:43:30.240 is bouncing solar radiation off the
00:43:32.880 earth
00:43:34.000 because we've seen volcanoes cause this
00:43:36.720 darkening effect in freezing
00:43:38.160 so we believe our scientists believe
00:43:39.839 that carbon dioxide is going to make the
00:43:41.280 earth
00:43:41.760 freeze by 2020 and so we've got to have
00:43:44.400 a global regime to take control
00:43:46.160 of all the factories and all the energy
00:43:47.760 and put a tax in for global government
00:43:50.079 in the name of stopping the ice age
00:43:51.839 then by about 1987 they went actually we
00:43:54.079 think it's going to heat up instead
00:43:55.680 so they flipped the the the propaganda
00:43:57.920 ask anybody you know
00:43:59.119 okay but don't you understand that
00:44:01.440 science back then
00:44:03.040 didn't have as much data as they have
00:44:04.640 now so their their models
00:44:06.560 and what they had predicted in 1963
00:44:09.599 is faulty compared to the information
00:44:11.359 they have just like falci said 2.5
00:44:13.760 million would be dead
00:44:15.920 from kelvin it was 200 000 but worldwide
00:44:18.720 what is it
00:44:20.000 a worldwide tuberculosis killed 20
00:44:22.400 million people 1.4 million here last
00:44:24.160 year but nobody
00:44:24.800 was killed yeah well coveted killed a
00:44:26.480 lot of time he killed a million
00:44:27.839 worldwide
00:44:28.480 what not even a million worldwide no is
00:44:30.960 that true
00:44:31.520 yup come on yup well how do we know oh
00:44:34.640 we use you in models again they're
00:44:36.480 they're our boss since when did the who
00:44:39.040 say the lockdown has to go on now they
00:44:40.960 go oh we're against the lockdown
00:44:42.640 your nation states that it's their fault
00:44:44.640 because they know millions are starving
00:44:45.839 to death
00:44:47.200 that is true and very underreported yeah
00:44:49.760 the who has now come out against
00:44:51.520 lockdown saying that
00:44:52.960 the reaction can't be a worse effect
00:44:56.240 than the actual disease so let me back
00:44:57.760 alex up with the climate changes like
00:44:59.200 they're
00:45:00.000 they're they're certainly you know we're
00:45:02.319 contributing to man-made global warming
00:45:04.240 but also what are you going to do what
00:45:06.240 are we going to do i don't know what you
00:45:07.839 know i mean that's another question
00:45:09.119 what are we going to do why does his mic
00:45:10.400 sound weird is it he's hot is he on it
00:45:13.119 or is it
00:45:14.000 how i'm hearing it i'm hearing like a
00:45:15.920 breakup of his mic
00:45:17.119 sounds good to me that's fine to me yeah
00:45:19.119 that's weird
00:45:20.400 okay i'm sorry it must be me jamie's
00:45:22.800 really low you sound great he sounds
00:45:24.240 good yeah
00:45:24.800 okay what is the climate control cause
00:45:26.640 that's very interesting like the idea of
00:45:29.040 using climate to con because as you said
00:45:32.400 with covid and we talked about this
00:45:34.640 we give up a lot of rights right in the
00:45:36.720 name of chronovirus exactly
00:45:39.119 look there's real issues we don't really
00:45:40.800 know what's going on they want to be
00:45:42.400 able to track
00:45:43.040 all carbon and tax it with a ai
00:45:45.839 surveillance grid with a social credit
00:45:47.599 score over it yeah and they admit all of
00:45:49.760 that
00:45:50.319 joe they tell us okay i understand that
00:45:52.240 but you do you understand that the
00:45:53.680 environmentalists who are concerned
00:45:55.359 are not there's a giant
00:45:58.560 amount of them that are legitimately
00:46:00.560 concerned that we're ruining the earth
00:46:02.079 i understand the greenhouse effects
00:46:03.440 fossil fuels i understand a greenhouse
00:46:04.960 effect but these people the reason why
00:46:06.640 they're acting the reason why they're
00:46:08.480 trying to get people on electric cars
00:46:10.319 and trying to get people off the fossil
00:46:12.000 fuels
00:46:12.800 hold up please they're they're
00:46:14.400 legitimately concerned like i don't
00:46:16.160 believe that these actual
00:46:17.440 environmentalists sure i agree with you
00:46:18.960 but i mean here's the deal the new
00:46:20.160 hummer looks the new hummer looks badass
00:46:22.079 here's the deal here's the deal but i'm
00:46:24.400 not getting one because i don't
00:46:25.520 contribute to global warming
00:46:26.560 did you make sure you don't want to
00:46:27.680 contribute to go listen be serious did
00:46:29.760 you know
00:46:30.400 did you know that on average more carbon
00:46:33.920 is spent
00:46:35.040 for electricity into a car than 93
00:46:38.720 octane gasoline
00:46:41.200 well i would believe that because i
00:46:42.640 would think it it it takes a lot to make
00:46:45.440 a [ __ ] electric car
00:46:47.040 but once no no no that's no no no
00:46:50.000 transmission lines
00:46:51.359 you lose up to behalf of transmission
00:46:53.440 and most of it's coal powered brother
00:46:55.680 so most per megawatt it's more it's
00:46:58.720 more so i'm plugging my tesla in and i
00:47:01.839 think
00:47:02.240 because that's how i like to think i'm a
00:47:03.839 good guy i'm plugging my tesla in
00:47:05.839 i'm helping save the world i'm not
00:47:07.280 because i'm contributing to
00:47:09.119 power no you're driving you're
00:47:10.560 contributing to putting
00:47:12.319 putting carbon dioxide back in and
00:47:14.319 oxygen and re-terraforming the planet
00:47:16.480 you're doing a badass job the biggest
00:47:18.640 energy guzzlers
00:47:19.760 electric cars are bad ass they are
00:47:22.480 putting out more carbon than anybody
00:47:24.160 yeah they don't come out the tail pipe
00:47:26.079 they come out the power plant top
00:47:28.319 okay but i love electric cars yeah
00:47:31.599 team carbon carbon how do you feel about
00:47:34.000 carbon okay how do you feel about
00:47:35.359 nuclear power
00:47:36.640 i absolutely hate it why do you hate it
00:47:39.280 isn't it clean
00:47:41.839 94 joe i'm not trying to tear you up
00:47:44.079 don't tear me up i don't know anything i
00:47:45.520 told you i'm a [ __ ] no no no no i used
00:47:47.040 to be for nuclear power
00:47:48.079 oh what happened i actually did research
00:47:50.720 what research did you do
00:47:52.240 um they're always saying it's totally
00:47:53.760 clean no problem
00:47:55.440 but then you can look at the u n zone
00:47:57.040 numbers which i believe international
00:47:58.400 atomic energy agency
00:48:00.000 look this up cbs news 94 of nuclear
00:48:03.280 plants are leaking at dangerous levels
00:48:05.839 look this up
00:48:06.640 pause jamie 94
00:48:10.160 of nuclear power plants are leaking at
00:48:12.079 dangerous levels
00:48:13.200 isn't the problem that we're using old
00:48:15.440 tech like yeah
00:48:16.640 now you see you're smart yeah much cause
00:48:18.319 you always know everything joe the
00:48:20.079 average power plant age is 36 years
00:48:22.880 almost all these power plants are the
00:48:24.559 life is 20 to 35 years
00:48:26.800 fukushima was already a decade old it
00:48:28.640 was supposed to be a general electric
00:48:29.839 model
00:48:30.400 using plutonium radioactive leaks found
00:48:32.559 at 75 percent of u.s
00:48:34.160 nuke sites yeah it's worse than that
00:48:35.520 it's 94 percent
00:48:37.680 okay well that's not that's not good i
00:48:40.800 don't know why 94 doesn't pop up out to
00:48:42.160 the but
00:48:42.800 wouldn't it be possible with innovation
00:48:45.520 that they currently have
00:48:46.880 access to yes yes yes but you talk about
00:48:49.680 corrupt companies i don't
00:48:51.280 listen if people actually ran these
00:48:53.359 right and
00:48:54.400 the executives here's an example bp i
00:48:56.960 think oil is great has toxic problems we
00:48:58.960 should clean it up we should find
00:49:00.160 alternatives there's all sorts of clean
00:49:01.520 energy we should go to that you know
00:49:02.880 isn't
00:49:04.000 solar is great whatever they've got
00:49:05.440 fission fusion a bunch of stuff coming
00:49:06.720 down
00:49:07.280 take one of the best films out there
00:49:09.119 because it's so accurate because i had
00:49:10.480 lawyers on from
00:49:11.599 i read the transcript of the trial the
00:49:14.240 uh event horizon
00:49:16.000 with with bp they literally have all
00:49:18.240 these degree engineers out there
00:49:20.240 and bp calls them up from england to
00:49:23.440 houston and says
00:49:24.400 you're spending 25 million dollars a day
00:49:26.160 on this super deep experimental whale
00:49:28.480 we've decided to not pour concrete they
00:49:30.160 call it mud in on top this
00:49:33.040 the executives say we'll save 25 million
00:49:35.760 dollars a day
00:49:36.800 if you dump water and all the engineers
00:49:39.200 went we have mathematical equations just
00:49:41.040 like water boils at a certain amount
00:49:42.800 okay we have a certain number of
00:49:43.760 chromosomes this is fact yeah and they
00:49:45.760 on record go
00:49:46.880 you're fired if you don't order them to
00:49:49.280 dump water into it
00:49:50.800 so they follow the order dump water in
00:49:53.040 for five days and it blows up
00:49:55.040 because water didn't have enough
00:49:56.319 pressure to hold what was going to be
00:49:58.480 coming out when they finally hit that
00:49:59.760 giant oil and gas deposit
00:50:01.440 down there at 20 000 feet under the
00:50:02.960 ground or whatever it was super deep
00:50:04.160 well that was deeper than that
00:50:05.520 so you you watched that movie with kirk
00:50:08.240 russell and the rest of it and
00:50:09.680 you know marky mark was an event horizon
00:50:11.520 the one where they they find
00:50:13.280 i'm sorry then horizons where they go
00:50:15.119 yeah event horizon is a spaceship yeah
00:50:17.280 that's
00:50:17.599 what i'm sorry i'm trying to remember
00:50:20.000 oil in the event horizon i'm like wait a
00:50:21.760 minute lawrence fishburne right here's
00:50:23.359 why i think they go to hell
00:50:24.720 here's my here's my brain deep water
00:50:27.440 water
00:50:28.240 pull up event horizon because that's a
00:50:29.839 great [ __ ] movie i love that movie
00:50:31.359 it's like they going downhill
00:50:32.720 they go into a new dimension also about
00:50:34.800 people but see how my brain got that
00:50:36.160 wrong but it's not on purpose no it's
00:50:37.520 okay event that's the [ __ ]
00:50:38.960 he pulls his eyeballs out he tells
00:50:41.200 everybody
00:50:42.000 yeah remember that yeah that's a great
00:50:43.680 [ __ ] movie pure evil
00:50:45.280 but listen i'm not trying to rant here
00:50:46.480 what i'm telling you joe is it's the
00:50:48.240 same thing with nuclear power plants
00:50:50.480 why would the executives at bp order
00:50:53.040 their engineers to do something that was
00:50:54.559 going to blow up they just said you
00:50:55.520 engineers are full of crap
00:50:56.800 we're going to make them might just be
00:50:58.000 arrogant engineers on adderall and they
00:50:59.760 made a big mistake
00:51:00.800 i don't know yeah that's what it could
00:51:02.079 be could be
00:51:03.839 that's what happened that is what
00:51:05.359 happened
00:51:07.200 well well those guys are probably
00:51:08.880 tweaked out right those those
00:51:10.559 executives what i'm saying it wasn't
00:51:11.920 engineers it was the executives
00:51:13.760 yeah but executives that's what i'm
00:51:14.880 saying why do you think they were like
00:51:16.400 keep pouring water in it keep pouring
00:51:17.839 water in it
00:51:19.040 because they were insane right i mean
00:51:20.960 that's what i'm saying about these
00:51:22.000 people the engineers
00:51:23.280 are at the mercy of these executives who
00:51:25.760 don't have the degrees the engineers
00:51:27.200 have
00:51:27.680 and they made a crucial error and they
00:51:29.520 forced the engineers to do something
00:51:31.119 that was ultimate and so i was agreeing
00:51:32.640 with you about we should listen to
00:51:34.000 scientists and engineers
00:51:35.760 i was just going back to your point that
00:51:37.680 yeah we don't know about the warming we
00:51:39.200 don't know what it's doing
00:51:40.240 the models they all use on warming
00:51:42.960 factor out the sun
00:51:44.160 right and you can't factor out the
00:51:45.520 southern equation i've had other
00:51:46.720 scientists that factor the sun in
00:51:48.240 and then they think despite all we're
00:51:50.640 doing
00:51:51.280 that within the next 200 years we're
00:51:52.640 going to it's very serious deep ice age
00:51:55.040 i think alex's point is that in all of
00:51:57.440 these things there are legitimate things
00:51:59.040 that you know kovid has
00:52:00.720 there there are real things people
00:52:01.920 getting sick global warming you know to
00:52:03.520 an extent
00:52:04.000 i'm sure is is happening of course it's
00:52:06.000 happening but then there are also
00:52:07.359 nefarious characters that want to use
00:52:09.359 that to take away your freedom there are
00:52:11.119 people that don't want you
00:52:12.240 owning a car there's all these legacy
00:52:14.720 systems whitney webb is a journalist who
00:52:16.400 came on my show
00:52:17.119 said a lot of people didn't want to
00:52:18.720 reopen the economy until they remade the
00:52:20.559 economy
00:52:21.280 and got rid of all these legacy systems
00:52:23.119 like and this is a dock
00:52:24.480 with eric schmidt it was the head of
00:52:25.680 google you could look it up and they
00:52:27.119 were saying you know
00:52:28.079 they were considering these legacy
00:52:29.280 systems like cash private ownership of
00:52:31.920 cars
00:52:32.800 you know things like that like getting
00:52:34.240 rid of all of these
00:52:36.240 things that are are distinctly american
00:52:38.319 ways of life and just saying that like
00:52:39.920 we don't want you to own a car this is
00:52:41.680 the most important thing that's been
00:52:43.359 said here today
00:52:45.839 one step at a time though why would they
00:52:47.839 want to get rid of
00:52:49.359 private ownership of cars because they
00:52:50.960 want control of people and if you allow
00:52:53.280 them to drive their own cars and use
00:52:54.720 cash
00:52:55.200 and run their own businesses and live in
00:52:56.640 their own home but let's start with cars
00:52:58.000 vertical integration let's start with
00:52:59.440 cars don't you think that
00:53:01.040 maybe the concern is they're looking at
00:53:03.280 the future of autonomous vehicles which
00:53:04.960 would drastically lower the mortality
00:53:06.800 rate on highways
00:53:07.920 and they're saying are they concerned
00:53:09.760 are the people that run this country joe
00:53:11.200 concerned with the mortality rate i mean
00:53:12.880 they're bombing other countries they're
00:53:14.240 doing this
00:53:15.520 they want centralized control hold
00:53:17.280 please we're steve wozniak the former
00:53:19.680 the founder of the apple stop says the
00:53:21.520 best ai is not as good as an answer
00:53:23.040 right this thought yeah but hold this
00:53:24.400 thought the mortality highways listen
00:53:26.720 you can't think if people are in the
00:53:28.160 woods with hoods up but the people with
00:53:30.240 at google that are working on autonomous
00:53:32.559 vehicles yeah
00:53:33.440 they're not the same people that are
00:53:35.359 trying to control governments all out
00:53:37.119 but
00:53:37.680 it's controlled by those guys all of
00:53:39.040 those people at google want to usher in
00:53:41.119 uh you know a brave new world they want

00:55:46.000 i've known it for 26 years 27 years well
00:55:48.079 here's another thing let me tell you
00:55:49.119 something
00:55:50.160 i like we we all know that you've [ __ ]
00:55:53.359 some things up
00:55:54.079 right and the your biggest [ __ ] up is
00:55:55.839 sandy hook but you've gotten
00:55:57.839 so many things right this is why i keep
00:56:00.079 talking to you about these things and
00:56:01.359 why i defend you
00:56:02.720 and why i think that it's [ __ ]
00:56:05.040 dangerous
00:56:06.160 to censor you and to say oh this guy we
00:56:08.799 need to get him de-platform to get all
00:56:10.480 these things
00:56:11.040 you're revealing some things that have
00:56:13.920 been proven on the show
00:56:15.040 so far to be true that make people very
00:56:17.599 uncomfortable well the first thing i was
00:56:18.799 gonna do was thank you for having me on
00:56:19.920 and have the courage but i was gonna say
00:56:21.680 the [ __ ] bohemian grove thing the
00:56:23.839 bohemian grove thing that was amazing
00:56:25.599 that was the first time i really got
00:56:26.720 into what he was doing and that was like
00:56:28.839 amazing i mean when you watch that
00:56:32.319 movie watch that you know it's it's
00:56:35.359 paradigm shift i've had people
00:56:36.960 trying to minimize that i've had people
00:56:39.200 just they all do i go listen to me i'm
00:56:40.799 not a billionaire well i'll give you the
00:56:41.920 real take on it because i've been there
00:56:43.040 and i think it's just a gateway to
00:56:44.240 things but let's get into what we grow
00:56:45.520 in a moment
00:56:46.480 i really want to give you i i want to
00:56:49.200 give you the big enchilada
00:56:50.480 the big enchilada okay yeah just mole
00:56:53.599 sauce
00:56:54.079 yes sir just like i love molay sauce i
00:56:56.079 do too just like i'm saying the
00:56:58.000 engineers and
00:56:58.880 meanwhile a lot of them have good points
00:57:00.400 i'm not saying they're wrong about all
00:57:01.520 this stuff
00:57:02.319 i'm simply telling you i've read what
00:57:03.760 the globalists have to say in their own
00:57:05.359 establishment communication okay and
00:57:08.559 i have it right here in my notes to talk
00:57:11.200 to you about the post-human era
00:57:14.400 and the system that they are setting up
00:57:16.799 where in all of their main publications
00:57:18.799 they say humans are flawed humans are
00:57:20.640 bad
00:57:20.960 they are but they are flawed right but
00:57:22.799 then these corporations are saying
00:57:24.160 they're going to take us out of our
00:57:25.200 bodies and make a silicon
00:57:27.359 and that's what elon musk talks about be
00:57:28.880 where are those that worship ai gods
00:57:31.200 well he's actually talking about
00:57:32.640 neuralink which is something where
00:57:33.920 they're going to be able to interface
00:57:35.040 with your brain and increase the
00:57:36.240 bandwidth in which you access
00:57:37.359 information but go ahead
00:57:38.640 well that's it and that's it seems
00:57:40.640 inevitable doesn't it no it's not
00:57:42.079 inevitable
00:57:43.119 already driverless cars don't know a
00:57:45.119 wreck up ahead or what to do they have
00:57:46.799 more accidents
00:57:47.760 steve wozniak as i was saying earlier
00:57:49.440 the founder of co-founder of apple says
00:57:52.400 the best ai isn't a million percent you
00:57:55.440 know close
00:57:56.240 to how good an aunt's brain is stop stop
00:57:58.240 stop stop stop
00:57:59.440 when they first developed cars they said
00:58:01.119 well how are you going to take them
00:58:02.000 there's no roads sure ai
00:58:03.440 built roads here's the do you understand
00:58:04.960 that the ai that's powering these cars
00:58:07.359 now
00:58:08.160 is not you understand the people running
00:58:10.079 the ar predatory anti-humans that say
00:58:12.319 they want to get rid of this is not a
00:58:13.520 predatory anti
00:58:14.319 no i didn't say he was but i understand
00:58:15.760 he's working on autonomous vehicles he
00:58:17.520 said beware
00:58:18.480 those that speak of ai gods yes
00:58:21.599 okay a lot of people are worried that
00:58:24.000 look elon is more
00:58:25.440 concerned don't give me one of those you
00:58:27.200 keep that [ __ ] away from me no no no no
00:58:28.799 no he doesn't drink good thank you
00:58:30.400 he's sober broken all this extra i'm
00:58:33.119 sitting next to alex jones i'm as high
00:58:35.359 election night okay but listen listen
00:58:37.680 election night we're gonna get lit
00:58:39.119 but these guys who are making this
00:58:42.640 in hollywood this is fake this is only
00:58:44.640 uh corn syrup coloring
00:58:46.559 do you think this is a good idea though
00:58:47.839 this idea that we should be expanding
00:58:49.359 our minds in this way and putting our
00:58:50.799 chips on
00:58:51.520 don't think it's good or bad i think it
00:58:54.559 is the nature of human innovation
00:58:56.559 i think we take things we improve upon
00:58:59.200 them we
00:58:59.760 we do that with everything at one point
00:59:08.720 they had morse code right yes they went
00:59:10.319 from morse code to you being able to
00:59:12.079 send me
00:59:12.640 uh a facetime video understood well
00:59:14.880 these things happened
00:59:16.079 we're not against technology humans
00:59:17.520 we're not against technology okay
00:59:19.440 so you're not against technology but
00:59:20.880 what i'm saying is if you
00:59:22.480 follow technological innovation it
00:59:25.280 becomes
00:59:26.400 better and better and more and more
00:59:28.000 invasive we need to design it where it
00:59:30.000 doesn't make us obsolete humans take
00:59:31.839 control their environment
00:59:32.960 we build our environment the globalists
00:59:34.640 have decided to have a post-human future
00:59:36.640 where humans are no longer relevant this
00:59:38.240 is where you lose i can show you they're
00:59:39.520 damn close
00:59:40.480 but i'm he's getting me because i just
00:59:42.400 gave you an article i just gave you an
00:59:44.079 article
00:59:45.599 because i think he's right i think the
00:59:47.440 only reason we're still around is
00:59:48.880 because they haven't figured out how to
00:59:50.160 get robots good enough
00:59:51.599 to get rid of all of it if they had the
00:59:54.000 right robots there would be no walmart
00:59:55.760 they should get rid of everybody
00:59:57.119 you you don't think that if they were
00:59:59.359 the right robots
01:00:00.319 right they're making us obsolete they're
01:00:02.480 making us awesome
01:00:03.440 get rid of the world danger danger
01:00:06.319 cooler
01:00:06.960 i like to go to walmart is that okay not
01:00:09.920 but once you have a robot you won't want
01:00:11.599 to go to walmart
01:00:12.559 why because it's it's it's dirty it's
01:00:15.359 filthy everyone's got covered i listened
01:00:17.040 to you
01:00:17.359 that's why they're doing the coma that
01:00:18.720 is the poster you're not essential under
01:00:20.960 covet
01:00:21.599 they listen they want a sense they want
01:00:23.520 to train you okay listen
01:00:25.359 look how calculators were great no one
01:00:26.799 knows how to do math now look how phones
01:00:28.559 are great no one knows their numbers
01:00:29.599 anymore
01:00:30.160 all the statistics show that the science
01:00:31.920 of technology is making us dumb
01:00:34.000 and that's why they wrote the big
01:00:35.520 article the co-owner of sun microsystems
01:00:38.160 in 2000 bill joy wrote why the future
01:00:40.400 doesn't need us
01:00:41.440 and he explains he went to a top
01:00:42.720 billionaire tech conference and they
01:00:44.240 made the decision to not let humans
01:00:45.839 sit around and play video games in the
01:00:47.200 future that they were just going to
01:00:48.240 slowly phase us out and kill everybody
01:00:51.040 stop they're not trying to kill okay
01:00:52.799 pull up why the future doesn't need us
01:00:54.400 but why why wouldn't they
01:00:58.079 can we reverse engineer the question
01:00:59.599 because we're called useless eaters
01:01:01.440 i don't think they're trying to kill
01:01:02.880 people i think they're trying to improve
01:01:04.160 what a person is
01:01:05.359 what i think we're doing oh by chopping
01:01:07.200 our son's balls off
01:01:08.640 okay you're going to go down another
01:01:10.000 rabbit hole you son of a [ __ ] by
01:01:11.839 increasing
01:01:13.119 our ability to access information and by
01:01:15.599 becoming a
01:01:16.559 sort of a symbiotic creature aligned
01:01:18.720 with technology and once we're in line
01:01:20.079 with the ai can censor everything we do
01:01:21.839 you think big tech
01:01:22.720 the minute big tech got control they
01:01:24.160 began censoring and it's the groups
01:01:25.839 behind that are very predatory joe
01:01:27.920 i do agree with you there there's no
01:01:29.520 firewall
01:01:30.960 here's the problem the first amendment
01:01:32.799 currently does not apply to big tech
01:01:34.960 right i believe it should and
01:01:39.760 i believe that what's happening now with
01:01:42.400 whether it's twitter
01:01:43.440 or facebook or youtube these platforms
01:01:46.559 are so big i think the argument can be
01:01:48.720 made
01:01:49.200 that they are utilities and that they
01:01:50.880 should be regulated like youtube
01:01:53.359 it should be a human we did not i agree
01:01:54.880 we did not to have access to these
01:01:56.319 things
01:01:56.880 we did not talk about what we're going
01:01:59.039 to cover pretty much
01:02:00.079 we're going to talk about a lot of
01:02:01.039 things let's bring this this is what i
01:02:02.400 wrote last night okay you're ready
01:02:03.839 the silicon called i want you to take it
01:02:06.960 down enough the silicon cult
01:02:08.960 okay go ahead it's another article no i
01:02:11.039 wrote this oh you wrote it these are
01:02:12.640 talking points the silicon cult
01:02:14.480 defining the enemy the war on carbon
01:02:16.799 announce up front that i am not
01:02:18.799 really a liberal or conservative i want
01:02:20.319 a pro-human future please listen to me
01:02:22.400 and hear me out
01:02:23.119 let's stop right there because you get
01:02:26.079 called
01:02:26.720 a neo-conservative you get called
01:02:29.039 alt-right
01:02:29.760 you get called a far-right person when i
01:02:32.400 first
01:02:32.880 met you you were protesting against
01:02:35.359 george w
01:02:36.319 bush and you were saying that what he
01:02:38.960 was doing
01:02:39.680 and what he was trying to usher in what
01:02:42.640 was essentially going to be the downfall
01:02:44.319 of western
01:02:45.119 civilization even before he was elected
01:02:46.559 yes i remember that
01:02:48.559 so when people say alex jones is far
01:02:51.440 right guy i'm like
01:02:52.559 he's complicated he's he's really
01:02:55.359 against corruption
01:02:56.559 more than he's against any particular
01:02:58.319 party you just
01:02:59.599 found that the right was less apt to
01:03:03.119 censor you
01:03:03.839 and more apt to listen to your ideas
01:03:05.680 exactly and i know we're all
01:03:07.520 not stoned today and so we're being like
01:03:09.839 a little aggressive but here's the old
01:03:11.440 election night if i'm gracious enough to
01:03:13.200 be here or you're gracious enough i'll
01:03:14.480 be here

01:04:44.160 i would call you a political pundit or
01:04:45.599 researcher
01:04:46.960 commentary it over the hill whatever one
01:04:48.880 last question
01:04:50.079 i read a washington times article many
01:04:52.160 years ago
01:04:53.119 where you had a comment about the
01:04:54.480 organization and then now it's been in
01:04:56.240 the wall street journal it's been a lot
01:04:57.440 of different newspapers
01:04:58.480 and that's the bohemian grove and back
01:05:00.640 in what was in 1996 when you joined
01:05:05.039 as a clinton advisor they were the
01:05:06.799 republicans were criticizing you oh what
01:05:08.400 about bohemian grove and then
01:05:09.680 you counted them and then you countered
01:05:11.839 them by saying hey i don't run around in
01:05:13.119 the woods naked what does that mean
01:05:14.559 here is the before mentioned washington
01:05:16.480 times article where he said i didn't run
01:05:18.400 around naked like they do

01:05:29.599 a happy member of the bohemian grove i
01:05:31.520 like the the folks who come there

01:05:46.240 need to talk to you about
01:05:51.280 now what we're watching for people that
01:05:53.039 are just listening is a bunch of people
01:05:54.559 wearing robes
01:05:55.680 that are burning an effigy in front of a
01:05:58.000 giant statue of molech the owl god and
01:06:00.319 it's the evidence of a child
01:06:01.760 well i don't know what it's that it's
01:06:02.880 what it is i think it's the effigy of a
01:06:04.240 child it looks like i believe it is a
01:06:05.520 grown woman
01:06:06.480 it's real mad right here and yeah okay

01:07:34.240 make understandings with people and
01:07:35.599 violate them
01:07:37.200 you you should ambush people on the
01:07:38.799 streets when that that's inappropriate
01:07:40.799 form of journalism if you wish to
01:07:42.160 practice that that's fine but don't ask
01:07:43.920 others to respect you for it
01:07:45.760 if you want to you you can do you're
01:07:47.119 free american like anything you want if
01:07:48.640 you want to be uncivil

01:07:53.520 oh well you're mr gergen i'm sorry
01:07:55.440 nobody sets policy in there
01:07:56.960 we try to be a gentleman and obviously
01:07:59.760 you don't belong there weaving spiders
01:08:01.280 coming out here
01:08:04.160 yeah that is a three-parter
01:08:08.079 anyways that's a three point listen you
01:08:09.839 could ignore that if it was like a bunch
01:08:11.200 of poor people in the woods doing that
01:08:13.280 these guys even then i'd be worried even
01:08:15.280 then it would be weird these guys are
01:08:16.799 that are the top
01:08:17.839 of like every industry in america it's
01:08:20.319 at least
01:08:20.880 curious who goes in there well people
01:08:23.679 are like i mean clint eastwood's
01:08:25.279 gone he's not really a member look look
01:08:28.319 is it fun look it's 2 700 acres
01:08:31.839 it was set up by mark twain and it was a
01:08:35.040 liberal deal for like hookers and gateds
01:08:38.080 and just everything else just a big huge
01:08:39.839 would you say gateds what gateage gay oh
01:08:42.399 gay dudes i was like no i'm saying if
01:08:43.839 you go back to like the 1870s
01:08:45.520 when mark twain set up it was
01:08:46.719 classically liberal it was partying it
01:08:48.560 was their own 27 acres it was saloons
01:08:50.479 they brought in female hookers there was
01:08:52.880 gay guys in there everything
01:08:54.158 it was just it was bohemian groves well
01:08:55.759 they called that the people did whatever
01:08:57.120 they wanted it was it was so it was open
01:08:58.960 and they had like poetry and they had
01:09:00.399 plays and all the rest of it then
01:09:02.319 uh by the time howard taft became
01:09:04.399 president the republicans basically
01:09:06.158 bought it
01:09:06.719 so the reason is it's important is the
01:09:08.399 republicans go there
01:09:09.839 to like they ship in all these private
01:09:11.359 hookers all these jets land nearby
01:09:13.439 but they also have a lot of gay sex
01:09:15.040 which they use them to basically
01:09:16.479 compromise people
01:09:17.920 into the cult and so there's a lot of
01:09:19.839 gay sex how do you know this
01:09:22.238 uh it came out in news articles no one
01:09:24.080 ever got footage of it i was in there
01:09:25.439 for one day i snuck in and people i
01:09:27.040 looked good back then they hit on me a
01:09:28.158 lot
01:09:28.719 i had like you know people i recognized
01:09:30.319 from tv walking right let's go right now
01:09:32.238 i mean it's a big gay hookup deal for
01:09:34.399 republicans i'm just telling you what it
01:09:35.920 is
01:09:36.238 and and then and then they've got this
01:09:38.080 this ritual that's only the feeder group
01:09:40.640 so i'm sitting there during the ritual
01:09:42.238 and i'm like hey this is pretty cool but
01:09:43.520 you go shut up i'll kill you
01:09:44.960 and they're all taking it very seriously
01:09:46.479 and i'm not saying it's a gay thing i'm
01:09:47.520 saying something that goes on
01:09:48.560 you were saying it was cool and people
01:09:49.839 were getting angry that you were saying
01:09:51.120 no i mean i was just quietly going oh
01:09:52.479 this is really interesting they're like
01:09:53.600 shut up this is a very important ritual
01:09:55.440 and they were taking it very serious
01:09:56.880 this hearse comes in
01:09:58.000 with the body of a child it is an effigy
01:09:59.920 they're not killing it and
01:10:01.199 it's just a bundle of sticks right yeah
01:10:02.719 well it looks like a kid no well later
01:10:04.719 others infiltrated later that worked
01:10:06.239 there and got his photos of it it's an
01:10:07.600 image of a kid
01:10:08.480 it's a little kid because mulligan in in
01:10:10.880 biblical is who they they sacrifice the
01:10:12.719 canon
01:10:13.199 it's a bull but they do it as an album
01:10:16.560 but that's from the bible is you would
01:10:17.679 sacrifice a child to give not your
01:10:19.360 children to the fires of mullet
01:10:20.960 right and and so i've given it to
01:10:23.440 experts in religious history it's not
01:10:25.120 even you know from christian perspective
01:10:27.600 it's a faustian deal mixed with
01:10:29.920 babylonian and religious
01:10:31.920 stuff from tyre yeah it's quirky look at
01:10:34.560 that look at that owl god and look at
01:10:36.400 the fire
01:10:37.360 underneath the owl god and there's
01:10:38.640 ronald reagan i mean if you saw that if
01:10:40.480 you were in the woods and you just saw
01:10:41.840 that you would be
01:10:42.960 terrified and richard nixon says
01:10:46.000 richard nixon on the richard nixon tapes
01:10:47.760 says it's a gay orgy
01:10:50.239 richard nixon said that you can pull up
01:10:51.600 richard nixon talks about yeah richard
01:10:53.440 nixon said something about it where
01:10:55.120 he the most goddamn [ __ ] thing you ever
01:10:57.120 seen i think it's i think it's just
01:10:59.199 allowing well nothing against that's
01:11:01.760 what it's saying
01:11:04.080 i think it's guys that aren't gay that
01:11:05.679 are that are that engaging gay acts
01:11:08.400 in the woods and then they have
01:11:10.159 something on each other similar to
01:11:11.679 epstein's island
01:11:12.800 that's right it's that's what it's a
01:11:14.320 rich it's a it's a it's like a
01:11:15.920 fraternity doing that you're gonna screw
01:11:17.280 up something
01:11:17.600 is that poison hold on a second what is
01:11:20.239 this here and they don't allow women
01:11:21.920 no it says uh founded in 1872 by a group
01:11:24.560 of male 1 that's the context
01:11:26.000 that youtube has let me talk about
01:11:27.280 bohemian grove this is the title of the
01:11:28.800 video
01:11:29.199 i'm told you found 18 richard nixon
01:11:30.880 bohemian grove most
01:11:32.640 [ __ ] goddamn thing he could ever
01:11:34.880 imagine yeah
01:11:35.920 yes play it a hundred percent play it i
01:11:38.640 want to hear some nixon tapes yeah
01:11:40.000 let me hear this
01:11:45.840 northern california you know what's
01:11:47.840 happening in san francisco
01:11:51.199 but it isn't this is just not an iraqi
01:11:53.840 part of town
01:11:54.719 but the upper class of the san francisco
01:11:57.360 is that way the elohim grower that i am
01:11:59.440 in
01:12:00.480 one time at the time the others have
01:12:02.640 come there
01:12:03.520 but it is the most vague goddamn that
01:12:05.679 you will ever imagine
01:12:09.440 the san francisco crowd goes in there
01:12:11.199 it's just terrible okay
01:12:13.040 so weird the owl and the uh it's
01:12:15.520 interesting and it
01:12:16.960 i don't know how seriously they take it
01:12:18.560 i mean that's the real question right
01:12:19.760 well yeah
01:12:20.320 i mean the whole gate thing's a side
01:12:21.520 issue right the point is is that
01:12:23.760 i've talked to people that i mean
01:12:25.920 according to ted gunderson the first
01:12:27.120 time i've ever heard about this was from
01:12:28.159 this former high-level fbi agent who's
01:12:29.920 gonna be the fbi director but he
01:12:31.199 wouldn't go along with corruption so he
01:12:32.480 wasn't it's on record gunners and almost
01:12:33.840 being the fbi director and he blew up
01:12:35.120 like the things like the franklin
01:12:36.239 scandal and he's been
01:12:37.600 the finders and the financial level
01:12:39.360 which was huge yeah which where the cia
01:12:41.520 was caught
01:12:42.560 trafficking you know the finders is a
01:12:44.320 cult that was called trafficking
01:12:45.280 children
01:12:45.920 and the cia squashed the florida uh
01:12:49.199 and then gundersen got it rated in in dc
01:12:51.280 and found a whole cia facility
01:12:53.040 with the snuff films every relax machine
01:12:55.040 and so he told me about all this and i
01:12:56.719 thought he was crazy
01:12:58.080 even though he was ted gunderson you
01:12:59.440 told us about it and we actually
01:13:01.360 pulled up one of those stories and i was
01:13:03.199 correct yes you're correct yes
01:13:04.640 yeah thank you so ted gunner says the
01:13:06.480 reason i know about this and he said
01:13:08.080 he said that they get people interested
01:13:11.280 with that ritual most there's like 2 000
01:13:13.120 members they bring about a thousand
01:13:14.239 guests not everybody can bring a guest
01:13:15.840 unlike the head of each camp can bring a
01:13:17.199 guest most of them are nice clint
01:13:18.719 eastwood goes there you know
01:13:20.239 danny glover goes there but it's an
01:13:22.000 all-male deal who's the other one danny
01:13:23.440 glover oh danny glover i'm just
01:13:24.719 mentioning it who's
01:13:25.440 the weapon danny that's all in there how
01:13:27.040 the [ __ ] is he in there
01:13:28.880 they probably like him from there he's
01:13:29.920 just a fun guy i saw him when i was
01:13:31.760 there
01:13:32.159 i saw that interesting i'm starting to
01:13:33.840 believe this is not i'm sorry to believe
01:13:35.280 we can get in i'm starting to believe
01:13:36.480 it's not bad
01:13:37.040 joe rogan they'd have him in immediately
01:13:38.719 i mean not now do a podcast
01:13:41.280 in front of the owl but i just want to
01:13:43.920 say that
01:13:44.880 overall what started out as a it's a
01:13:47.360 truly artsy liberal thing that i think
01:13:49.360 is good
01:13:49.920 i think guys deserve to go off the woods
01:13:52.239 like we've done since
01:13:53.120 humans were humans and party and do
01:13:55.600 whatever
01:13:56.159 right and so and so it's but the thing
01:13:58.480 is then the weird skull here's what
01:14:00.239 happened
01:14:00.719 about 1900 skull and bones that was at
01:14:03.360 uh yale
01:14:04.239 in new haven connecticut that was a
01:14:05.679 german death cult it took over bohemian
01:14:08.080 grove and that's when they set up that
01:14:09.840 as the central deal so it's this big
01:14:11.760 inviting fun party
01:14:12.960 what happens is skull and bones because
01:14:15.040 that's one of the other rumors about
01:14:16.640 skull and bones they
01:14:17.679 compromise you i know they compromised
01:14:20.080 you so that you're always a part of this
01:14:22.080 organization before he died i did
01:14:24.239 multiple interviews with anthony sutton
01:14:26.320 the top
01:14:26.960 congressional advisor to senator frank
01:14:30.000 church
01:14:31.520 and we only know about sutton because
01:14:34.159 charlotte israeli whose father was
01:14:36.000 high-level skill and bones
01:14:37.440 gave him all of their internal manuals
01:14:40.239 and she's been a frequent guest she's
01:14:41.840 retired now
01:14:42.480 america's secret establishment an
01:14:44.080 introduction to the order of skull and
01:14:45.440 bones
01:14:46.000 yes okay and so this is this is a
01:14:49.360 russell trust uh true illuminati
01:14:51.920 illuminati set up
01:14:53.080 1776 to counter our revolution by adam
01:14:55.520 visable it funds the jacobins
01:14:57.280 it funds the french revolution it's it's
01:14:59.440 the opposite of a true egalitarian open
01:15:01.199 liberal revolution
01:15:02.400 it's the leftist always say they're the
01:15:04.239 liberal liberal and leftists are two
01:15:05.760 different deals
01:15:06.800 leftist is left hand past satanism
01:15:09.120 liberalism is egalitarian open society
01:15:11.199 true liberalism
01:15:12.239 and so the left-hand path uh set this up
01:15:16.080 and then they wanted they sent all this
01:15:17.679 opium money they had over in 1831
01:15:22.000 to yale to set up a german secret
01:15:24.719 society of the illuminati
01:15:26.560 which then has become one of the
01:15:27.679 dominant secret societies and in there
01:15:29.520 they do actual satanic rituals
01:15:31.199 they get in coffins uh they they do
01:15:34.000 simulated human sacrifices
01:15:36.159 they have gay sex as part of the ritual
01:15:38.400 they they bathe in
01:15:39.840 uh huge facilities of feces uh this was
01:15:43.280 this was a made by robert de niro made a
01:15:45.920 movie
01:15:46.480 skull and bones are doing that stuff now
01:15:48.960 absolutely i know somebody broke into it
01:15:50.480 but wow who's the
01:15:52.560 how can this be proven well matt damon
01:15:54.800 made a movie
01:15:55.679 called the good shepherd i think yes and
01:15:57.600 and in that it's robert de niro directed
01:15:59.520 it
01:16:00.239 okay and that's super accurate where
01:16:01.840 it's got the sword and the devil and
01:16:03.360 they're in they're in these big vats of
01:16:04.960 calming they did leak a facebook uh
01:16:07.679 photo album of a bunch of skull and
01:16:09.199 bones kids hand on a deer island that
01:16:10.800 kind of looked like losers
01:16:12.159 i know they're not nobody i know they're
01:16:13.840 not but they kind of look like lose i
01:16:15.280 mean it was kind of like embarrassing
01:16:16.560 billionaires look like losers yeah they
01:16:18.080 look like emaciate you were like these
01:16:19.679 are the
01:16:20.080 these are the illuminati it was kind of
01:16:21.520 like no i totally agree with you yeah
01:16:23.120 remember abc news because they wanted to
01:16:24.800 get bush in trouble right before the
01:16:26.280 2004 election
01:16:28.960 another frat was able to because they're
01:16:30.480 all doing this crap shoot video down
01:16:32.719 into it where they're going devil equals
01:16:34.320 death satan and they had girls they
01:16:36.239 finally brought into the membership
01:16:37.600 it was all boys before yeah sacrificing
01:16:39.840 so of course it's idiotic
01:16:41.199 it's training wheels for what they do
01:16:43.280 but inside they go grave rob they've got
01:16:45.040 geronimo skull
01:16:46.159 yeah the george h.w bush stole
01:16:47.679 supposedly stole geronimo skull yeah you
01:16:49.600 got to do things like i don't know if
01:16:50.880 that but that's a root that's a
01:16:52.400 legend rumor thing yeah it's probably
01:16:55.920 been broken into yeah one time the
01:16:57.920 police went in there but the point is
01:16:59.520 is that skull and bones order 322
01:17:03.040 is the illuminati germanic death cult
01:17:05.120 that now set up chapters all of the u.s
01:17:06.719 and it took over bohemian grove
01:17:08.640 around 1900 and so that's why bohemian
01:17:11.199 grove is still this
01:17:12.239 artisan you know deal of elitist artist
01:17:14.719 but then it got co-opted by the
01:17:16.320 republican party in skull boats
01:17:18.480 and helmet schmidt german chancellor
01:17:20.800 wrote men in power as a political
01:17:22.239 retrospective
01:17:23.280 we retired in the late 80s saying i love
01:17:26.640 our illuminati rituals
01:17:28.080 that we have in germany in our own
01:17:29.679 sacred groves but i think they've taken
01:17:31.280 to a new level with skull and bones
01:17:33.280 at bohemian grove and i really enjoy the
01:17:34.880 time we have there
01:17:36.640 so these are just these elite
01:17:38.400 institutions where
01:17:40.000 and skullenbones i think they seek to
01:17:41.440 like create uh
01:17:43.440 close friends amongst people that may
01:17:45.280 not know each other create loyalty
01:17:47.360 amongst this group of people that's why
01:17:48.560 they got to tell them all the things
01:17:49.440 that yeah you got to tell them all the
01:17:50.560 sexual history all that stuff
01:17:51.920 they want these people to be loyal to
01:17:53.199 each other so when they they're not
01:17:55.280 loyal to the laws of america they're
01:17:56.960 loyal to this this oath that they take
01:17:58.880 with each other and exactly and it's
01:18:00.400 like a team america
01:18:01.679 look at this descendant sue's skull and
01:18:04.159 bones over geronimo's bones
01:18:06.080 documents show george h bush george w
01:18:08.400 bush's grandfather rob
01:18:09.600 geronimo's grave members members of the
01:18:12.719 secret society allegedly steal
01:18:14.400 valuable things and put them in tomb
01:18:17.120 great
01:18:17.679 grandson says geronimo should be burned
01:18:20.400 buried
01:18:20.960 in accordance with tradition federal law
01:18:23.360 protects native americans rights to
01:18:25.360 their family member's remains
01:18:27.679 and let's expand on that what he just
01:18:29.040 said because this guy's done he's
01:18:30.080 studying
01:18:31.280 it's like thank you it's like a team
01:18:32.719 america when the head guy goes
01:18:34.640 she's the only person who's ever said
01:18:35.920 i've said no no nobody says you go suck
01:18:37.679 my [ __ ] gary it's not about sex
01:18:40.320 in skull and bones in bohemian grove
01:18:42.640 what he said is most these guys are not
01:18:44.000 gay
01:18:44.560 it's an act of dominance like oh you're
01:18:46.800 a senator you want to be president bend
01:18:48.400 over and like a former president screws
01:18:50.000 you in the ass
01:18:50.960 and that's what they do i mean the
01:18:52.159 ritual is i'm in charge bend over
01:18:55.040 well isn't that a thing with
01:18:56.560 fraternities anyway like hazing the
01:18:58.560 jizz on a cracker exactly so it's the
01:19:00.560 next deal yeah but most people are
01:19:02.159 fraternity i mean these are the
01:19:03.760 top kids these are kids that they think
01:19:05.760 are going to occupy leadership positions
01:19:08.480 in the world and often do and often do
01:19:11.199 so even let me give you an example even
01:19:12.719 john ronson saw the photo with me when
01:19:14.159 we stuck in bohemian grove yeah
01:19:15.679 and and they had it hanging and people
01:19:17.199 say why don't you get a video i have a
01:19:18.239 camera hidden right here
01:19:19.600 it's henry kissinger bent over in a
01:19:22.159 woman's dress sticking his fingers in
01:19:23.600 his ass
01:19:24.320 bill clinton in a blue dress with jeff
01:19:26.400 in jeffrey epstein's house yeah but
01:19:27.840 that's just an artist's rendition do you
01:19:29.280 know that that was just an artist made
01:19:30.640 that yeah but maybe this was an artist
01:19:32.000 tradition
01:19:32.560 we're in a clubhouse yeah bronson wrote
01:19:34.480 about this oh so
01:19:35.600 it's a photo or a painting no it was a
01:19:38.000 it looked like a photo but let's just
01:19:39.040 say it's a painting i don't know it
01:19:40.239 wasn't i mean
01:19:41.040 it's ancient memory 20 years ago okay 20
01:19:43.199 plus you know but i mean bronson's like
01:19:44.880 look at that i'm like oh is that
01:19:46.239 kissinger yeah it's kissinger
01:19:48.000 it's all about being improper and then
01:19:50.400 they all go get
01:19:51.360 caught to compromise each other to be in
01:19:53.120 the club it's a hazing thing so that
01:19:54.719 they can trust each other because
01:19:55.840 they're all doing shady [ __ ] yeah yes
01:19:57.679 even if it's an artist's rendition why
01:19:59.199 does jeffrey epstein have it in his
01:20:00.480 townhouse a picture of the president in
01:20:02.000 a blue dress well because the president
01:20:04.320 flew in his [ __ ] well that's what i
01:20:05.920 mean that's what i mean he was busy
01:20:07.360 and by the way maxwell has now come out
01:20:09.600 in court it's getting no attention
01:20:11.440 confirming
01:20:12.400 okay clinton did fly to that island that
01:20:14.800 broke four days ago it's gotten zero
01:20:16.400 yeah no they're not paying they're not
01:20:17.520 paying attention we haven't heard
01:20:18.719 anything other than those court
01:20:19.920 documents
01:20:20.880 listen i told you listen guys it's not
01:20:22.960 like i'm even that special
01:20:24.560 my mom's brother was a famous helicopter
01:20:27.520 pilot in vietnam
01:20:28.400 running black ops into laos and cambodia
01:20:31.040 and stuff and then he
01:20:32.800 i i shouldn't tell these stories but no
01:20:34.560 one's ever heard this stuff
01:20:35.840 but you know i remember growing up and
01:20:37.600 telling me this stuff and it was it was
01:20:38.800 true
01:20:39.600 like they were i'm like i'm not going to
01:20:41.280 do it please
01:20:43.840 i just can't do it what's the danger you
01:20:45.440 said so much uh
01:20:46.880 well no i mean let's just say he took
01:20:49.920 the fall for something that was going on
01:20:51.679 he didn't get in trouble for it he got
01:20:53.120 promoted
01:20:53.760 and he was involved in iran contra and
01:20:55.440 that's how people get promoted they fail
01:20:57.040 upward by
01:20:57.840 taking a lot of times to blame for
01:20:59.520 something or this is
01:21:01.280 that's like so i grew up i i mean i grew
01:21:04.239 up not just him but other family you
01:21:05.679 know that was it was like something
01:21:06.800 special
01:21:07.360 you know about those navy seal guys you
01:21:08.800 got a security done a bunch of crazy
01:21:10.000 stuff that's what our military does it's
01:21:11.760 not what you hear on the news
01:21:13.120 right and and and it's just completely
01:21:16.239 out of control stuff
01:21:17.440 right and i mean my uncle told me he
01:21:19.040 said he said yeah i know i got out
01:21:21.440 of working for these groups and
01:21:22.639 everything uh as you know an army
01:21:24.800 officer that was sheep dip he wasn't
01:21:26.080 there we wouldn't yeah he wasn't wearing
01:21:27.120 an army uniform
01:21:28.320 yeah right hot we were talking high
01:21:29.840 level like you're talking running the
01:21:31.120 real stuff like right
01:21:32.000 here well he was in charge he liked the
01:21:34.400 command base in guatemala city right
01:21:35.920 because he was like a top morse code guy
01:21:37.360 yeah of course he had satellites there
01:21:38.560 but nobody could read this morris code
01:21:39.679 coded so he was sending stuff to the
01:21:40.880 white house moore's coat like
01:21:42.560 he was like when he was a kid he was a
01:21:43.600 champion morse coder so he wasn't just
01:21:45.360 in command he was like running all the
01:21:46.639 stuff
01:21:47.440 and uh he just said i had to do it
01:21:49.360 because he said it was
01:21:50.480 kids being smuggled out of orphanages by
01:21:52.719 the cia for sex ops in dc
01:21:55.040 jesus christ right he told me that he
01:21:56.880 told me that when he was dying of
01:21:58.400 pneumonia
01:21:58.960 jesus [ __ ] yeah now what is it with
01:22:02.719 kids why is the way to compromise people
01:22:05.360 it's the it's the energy too
01:22:06.960 yeah i mean if somebody will hurt kids
01:22:08.400 and he wouldn't if somebody will hurt
01:22:09.920 kids
01:22:10.239 like what else they'll do anything but
01:22:11.760 that's what everyone's so terrified of
01:22:13.440 today right that there are
01:22:14.719 some sex trafficking and sex cultures
01:22:18.080 and there's ten times over ten times i
01:22:20.080 love people but that's like
01:22:21.440 they are there but that's a fact right
01:22:22.800 but if you want to get on [ __ ] gets wild
01:22:24.880 and it's sloppy and messy and you've
01:22:26.400 talked about that too it gets sloppy and
01:22:27.840 messy and they're not right about
01:22:28.880 everything
01:22:29.520 but the idea there are human traffic the
01:22:31.679 the entire
01:22:32.800 is just people on the internet they're
01:22:34.239 like playing games larping
01:22:36.080 acting like they're taking credit for
01:22:37.679 something and a lot of them are good
01:22:39.120 people it's just that
01:22:40.239 you can give them like bona fide like
01:22:41.840 look they just busted a giant child
01:22:43.199 trafficking ring associated press
01:22:44.800 they don't want that they want no
01:22:45.920 there's underground bases and there's
01:22:47.760 dinosaurs they're sailing wants the real
01:22:49.520 [ __ ]
01:22:50.159 they don't want to want so is it that
01:22:52.560 they're just into things that are
01:22:54.719 just huge more ridiculous than reality
01:22:58.320 like what is
01:22:59.040 yeah because it's escapism and hillary's
01:23:00.880 in prison secretly
01:23:02.320 oh right i think they just learned about
01:23:03.920 the world over the last year and it
01:23:05.520 melted their mind like you've been
01:23:06.800 looking at
01:23:07.520 when you were wrong with joe a few
01:23:08.400 months ago you crystallize it perfectly
01:23:09.760 yeah they've been asleep
01:23:11.120 now they've woken up and now they think
01:23:13.120 everything's a cartoon version well say
01:23:14.400 like you said yeah well it was just like
01:23:15.760 again it's like if you didn't know
01:23:16.880 anything about the franklin scandal you
01:23:18.239 didn't know about epstein or you hadn't
01:23:19.520 read these books you didn't know the
01:23:20.960 stories your uncle told you and then
01:23:22.960 eventually you just found out there was
01:23:24.239 an
01:23:24.480 island where all these politicians were
01:23:26.320 going to and having sex with kids and
01:23:28.000 they were getting compromised
01:23:29.520 your mind would melt and then you would
01:23:31.679 get paranoid and then you would start
01:23:33.280 thinking that everybody's a pedophile
01:23:34.960 and that there's
01:23:35.679 tunnels underground when the reality is
01:23:37.760 it is bad
01:23:39.199 but sometimes you have to take a step
01:23:40.639 back and take a breath and realize that
01:23:42.159 like
01:23:42.800 there are good people and not everybody
01:23:45.520 is
01:23:45.840 evil but there is a lot of evil out
01:23:47.679 there but you got to take a step back
01:23:49.120 and try to realize like what is what
01:23:50.960 well there's one picture of clinton
01:23:52.719 getting massaged by this woman
01:23:54.400 and they were using it as uh sort of
01:23:56.800 evidence but the woman's clearly a woman
01:23:59.760 she's in her 20s and they were saying
01:24:01.520 she'd been working for him since she was
01:24:02.719 like 15.
01:24:04.960 let's never use clinton as the example
01:24:06.639 of the q and on people being wrong
01:24:08.800 that's not even what i'm saying it's
01:24:10.320 never there it is that's a grown woman
01:24:12.480 she's a grown-up yeah so listen let's be
01:24:14.800 clear the media did a limited hangout
01:24:17.280 they went with these whistleblowers
01:24:19.679 instead of all the other people
01:24:21.920 and and the fact that the the witnesses
01:24:24.000 reported at epstein island
01:24:25.600 in the caribbean little st george on the
01:24:27.520 other island too
01:24:28.719 that boats would pull up the middle of
01:24:30.400 the night to the shacks
01:24:32.000 with with little brown kids and those
01:24:34.480 are the ones that get disappeared but
01:24:35.840 who who reported this
01:24:38.560 it's in it's in the uh it's in major
01:24:40.880 documentaries it's in netflix
01:24:42.239 documentaries it's in all the witnesses
01:24:43.679 we talked to
01:24:44.480 and they said my witnesses my people i
01:24:46.639 talked to over 10 years ago said
01:24:48.320 you remember me telling you about it
01:24:49.520 they've got an island the caribbean
01:24:51.199 they've got an island in the
01:24:52.000 mediterranean
01:24:53.440 they've got ranches in the southwest and
01:24:56.400 that they

01:26:59.760 federal credit union was being run by a
01:27:01.040 guy named larry king was this rising

01:27:11.600 de camp stumbled upon this stumbled upon
01:27:13.520 the occult weird
01:27:14.800 ritual [ __ ] going on too in addition to
01:27:17.280 the pedophilia and all that
01:27:18.719 and then he went to this guy his mentor
01:27:21.760 who he knew from from vietnam from the
01:27:23.520 military who was a cia guy whose name is
01:27:25.679 escaping me
01:27:26.800 william colby william colby you went to
01:27:28.480 liam called me and william colby
01:27:29.679 basically said to the camp listen
01:27:31.040 you're going up force you're going up
01:27:32.480 against forces that are way too powerful
01:27:34.560 you don't even know what you're you're
01:27:36.000 knocking on here and then william colby
01:27:38.000 i think changed his mind and said [ __ ]
01:27:39.199 it you know what
01:27:40.159 we should stop doing like let's if we're
01:27:42.480 gonna fight this let's fight it
01:27:43.760 and then a little while later william
01:27:45.280 colby who was in great healthcare
01:27:48.480 yeah has an accident in his canoe is
01:27:50.239 found dead
01:27:51.600 um in a river right by his house with
01:27:54.400 his dinner still on the table so it's
01:27:55.679 like nobody nobody gets up in the middle
01:27:57.040 of the dinner to go canoeing
01:27:58.719 so this has been a common theme forever
01:28:00.639 whereas if you go against these
01:28:02.239 these people you find you're dead he was
01:28:05.440 76 when he drowned though
01:28:07.360 yeah but in a canoe while his dinner was
01:28:09.199 still sometimes people have heart
01:28:10.560 attacks when they're 76. i understand i
01:28:12.320 understand i understand that okay we're
01:28:13.760 connecting dots here that maybe we don't
01:28:15.280 need to
01:28:16.320 disclos okay uh william colby director
01:28:19.040 of central intelligence chose to
01:28:20.480 disclose some of the nation's darkest
01:28:21.920 secrets to save the spy service he loved
01:28:24.159 drowned on april 27th at a tributary
01:28:31.920 who was a private investigator hired to
01:28:33.520 get to the bottom of the it's like barry
01:28:35.040 steele man they're getting rid of the
01:28:36.400 people they just get rid of them
01:28:38.080 all right so so listen we've done
01:28:39.840 bohemian grove we've done
01:28:41.760 let me tell you senator de camp was on
01:28:44.320 record running
01:28:45.280 major level operation phoenix which was
01:28:48.080 a high-level cia torture operation
01:28:50.400 and an execution operation so uh
01:28:53.760 apocalypse now is kind of based on some
01:28:55.520 of the things they did
01:28:56.880 but he's on record highly decorated at
01:28:58.800 that i don't want to go too far away
01:29:00.080 from the epstein thing because i still
01:29:01.040 have a whole lot more
01:29:01.920 let's go back to epstein okay the island
01:29:03.920 itself like first of all epstein had
01:29:06.320 this
01:29:06.880 crazy place in new york city seven-story
01:29:09.440 palace that
01:29:10.320 the guy who owned victoria's secrets he
01:29:13.520 gave it to him
01:29:15.120 yeah because of probably blackmail right
01:29:17.520 and then there was other billionaires
01:29:19.360 who it turned out had and this is like
01:29:21.360 had been glossed over including bill
01:29:23.120 gates
01:29:23.600 bill gates stays there and tried to deny
01:29:25.520 it but bill gates denies
01:29:27.440 uh staying with uh epstein but confirmed
01:29:29.920 he stayed there and in his paris home
01:29:32.080 okay and uh this was also he met with
01:29:34.880 him
01:29:35.120 post his first arrest correct yes
01:29:38.320 because he was arrested yeah a lot of
01:29:40.159 people did chelsea handler i did it with
01:29:41.440 him i believe after the arrest too i
01:29:42.800 mean a lot of people looked past that
01:29:44.239 apparently
01:29:45.679 british royal okay bill gates met with
01:29:48.400 jeffrey epstein many times despite his
01:29:50.320 past
01:29:50.800 and they're gonna say jamie's really
01:29:52.239 fast he's the best he's the best
01:29:55.520 um so
01:29:58.880 let's let's go back to this american
01:30:01.360 where are you absolutely getting
01:30:02.800 a huge interest in tech we love tech yes
01:30:05.679 yes
01:30:06.000 and he wanted to he he brought
01:30:08.239 scientists and and big tech people over
01:30:10.239 his house in new york city here's the
01:30:11.520 deal
01:30:11.840 they were doing i said this over 10
01:30:14.239 years ago
01:30:15.120 that they were involved in secret
01:30:16.639 breeding programs for cloning
01:30:18.480 okay before we get to that scientists
01:30:21.760 how were they getting these signs where
01:30:23.280 are they getting all the money first of
01:30:24.560 all
01:30:24.880 where's he getting the money get the
01:30:26.000 silent where's he getting the money to
01:30:28.239 to buy this giant or get he was we now
01:30:30.880 know that he was a nexus point from the
01:30:33.040 dirty sides
01:30:34.320 of the cia mi6 and mossad at least yeah
01:30:37.600 and so they were compromising people and
01:30:39.679 then as he would compromise people
01:30:42.080 most of them knew they were being
01:30:43.040 compromised they wanted to be
01:30:44.159 compromised to be let in
01:30:45.679 to then run operations and be given even
01:30:47.760 more money he was also the money manager
01:30:49.360 for a guy named les wexner who's a
01:30:50.719 billionaire who owns victoria's secret
01:30:52.320 the limited among other things
01:30:53.840 that's the guy he was gifting epstein a
01:30:55.920 property he gave him a seven
01:30:57.280 well that's where he got some of the
01:30:58.400 first money well eric weinstein who's a
01:31:00.560 legit yes
01:31:01.520 financial guy looked at him and said
01:31:03.679 this guy doesn't know what the [ __ ] he's
01:31:04.719 talking about
01:31:05.760 he said he's playing a role and then
01:31:08.239 scientists were like that too when they
01:31:09.679 went to his house to go
01:31:10.719 oh epstein's is is like playing a role
01:31:13.360 yes he has no
01:31:14.400 you know so whatever he's doing he's
01:31:15.679 working for somebody well let me tell
01:31:16.880 you they want to corrupt the scientific
01:31:19.040 elite to go along with their agenda on
01:31:21.040 climate change
01:31:22.159 to go along with their agenda on viruses
01:31:24.639 to go along with their agenda because
01:31:25.920 they know
01:31:26.320 scientists are respected so you want to
01:31:28.000 have them compromised so they should go
01:31:29.600 on whatever it is you want so whatever
01:31:31.120 it is you want so if you want to do
01:31:32.800 something and manipulate reality
01:31:35.040 to make your agenda
01:31:38.080 go through you compromise the scientists
01:31:41.600 and then these elite experts who you
01:31:44.159 have
01:31:44.639 on film having sex with 16 year olds
01:31:47.440 then you yeah so maybe man-made global
01:31:49.520 maybe man-made level warming is real and
01:31:51.600 really bad doesn't matter the solution
01:31:53.040 they have as a global tax you pay them
01:31:54.880 so it's a scam but as big as epstein was
01:31:57.199 he was small
01:31:58.480 compared to these other finders groups
01:32:00.239 and other organizations
01:32:01.600 that even came out in the news at the
01:32:02.719 time in the late 80s early 90s and then
01:32:04.800 the communist chinese
01:32:06.880 they're running the blackmail rings with
01:32:09.280 hunter biden and the democratic party
01:32:11.040 and
01:32:11.360 dianne feinstein and all these people at
01:32:14.000 levels
01:32:14.880 way way way above anything anybody else
01:32:16.960 has seen jesus christ
01:32:19.600 i always i always got a bad feeling from
01:32:21.360 dianne feinstein
01:32:22.719 i never had anything turned out her main
01:32:24.880 our main assistant was a chinese actual
01:32:27.040 agent
01:32:28.159 yeah maxwell powell pleads for release
01:32:31.760 says
01:32:32.400 jailed heiress sir starving and
01:32:35.120 humiliating clothes
01:32:36.400 and that's unfair for her and i think i
01:32:38.000 mean this is the leader's statement you
01:32:40.000 should give her
01:32:40.800 oh oh she i mean on record this woman
01:32:43.440 was involved with all these horrible
01:32:44.320 things and now
01:32:45.040 oh my god she said humiliating clothes
01:32:47.440 why do you think trump
01:32:48.719 said like when they asked her about it
01:32:50.239 well i wish her well he's always smart
01:32:52.080 ass like
01:32:52.719 because epstein was killed in prison so
01:32:55.280 he's like i wish her well because i want
01:32:56.880 to get data he's also like a rich guy he
01:32:58.960 knew her
01:32:59.440 right i mean well he later clarified it
01:33:01.360 i gave you what he said
01:33:02.719 do you think trump's cleaning everything
01:33:04.880 in in this extent i mean oh you want to
01:33:06.560 get the ml on trump well i
01:33:07.840 would like to because i know that yeah
01:33:09.840 i'll give you no no
01:33:11.760 here we go my only superpower is that i
01:33:13.679 really try to give you the accurate
01:33:14.719 thing doesn't mean i'm always right
01:33:15.920 about 95 of the time that's why earlier
01:33:18.080 went down that rabbit troll what i'm
01:33:19.360 saying listen trump doesn't like
01:33:20.639 lobbyists he fired him only trying to
01:33:21.920 make the best decisions for everybody in
01:33:23.760 a pragmatic free market
01:33:25.040 to not have one side of trade deals but
01:33:27.040 his blind side was by him not letting
01:33:28.800 lobbyists in
01:33:29.679 everyone around him became unofficial
01:33:31.040 lobbyist that became a 20-minute lab
01:33:32.719 rabbit i'm not bitching about okay but
01:33:34.400 let me tell you about trump
01:33:36.159 trump's dad was a super right-wing
01:33:39.120 pro-america dude
01:33:40.719 who was actually a huge founder of the
01:33:42.239 john birch society
01:33:44.000 he introduced him to uh the
01:33:47.040 head of the house un-american activities
01:33:49.520 group
01:33:50.400 that worked for nixon and eisenhower
01:33:52.000 that actually ran the red scare
01:33:53.760 some of it was good as it was bad roy
01:33:55.840 cohen and so his personal lawyer
01:33:58.880 for 25 years was roy cohen who
01:34:02.159 was like joe mccarthy's best friend
01:34:04.080 right joe mccarthy's chief of staff
01:34:05.600 chief of staff yeah i mean he ran it and
01:34:07.679 he ran it yeah he ran house and senate
01:34:09.520 he was
01:34:09.840 he was the big enchilada and so trump
01:34:11.920 was actually heavily influenced by his
01:34:13.360 father that was anti-communist
01:34:14.960 acted nice and liberal in new york but
01:34:16.480 like knew all this john bert society

01:35:47.199 everybody including me and then she goes
01:35:48.880 but i'm not anti-free speech i just want
01:35:50.320 alex jones band
01:35:51.840 but then they have this new show called
01:35:53.360 the jacobins well let's talk about evil
01:35:55.760 the young turks were the group that ran
01:35:57.840 the armenian genocide
01:36:00.480 they ran the armenian genocide on record
01:36:02.560 kill over a million half christians
01:36:04.080 they named themselves the young turks
01:36:05.360 they go oh we don't know what that means
01:36:07.040 now they're called the jacobins the
01:36:08.639 jacobins
01:36:09.440 ran the french revolution right and were
01:36:11.199 the illuminati i told you about them
01:36:12.400 earlier yeah
01:36:13.040 so it's like every name they've got is
01:36:15.199 like the hitler youth basically
01:36:17.119 i mean you know the the young turks and
01:36:19.440 that is a
01:36:20.239 very unfortunate name well they also
01:36:22.159 people run around
01:36:23.280 with you know the people who watch a lot
01:36:24.800 of those shows walk around with
01:36:26.400 either the chickavera shirts or they're
01:36:27.840 unironically calling themselves maoists
01:36:29.600 these are like suburban white kids
01:36:31.440 walking around going on my mallet 100
01:36:34.400 smartphones
01:36:35.280 right yeah yeah that is a problem i
01:36:37.600 think they're trying to do good and i
01:36:39.360 think they think they are doing good i
01:36:40.880 really do
01:36:41.760 i think when they thought that hey uh
01:36:44.400 i'm not
01:36:45.040 uh anti-free speech but ban alex jones
01:36:47.840 right
01:36:48.159 they just don't understand what that
01:36:50.000 means there's a reason
01:36:51.600 why you can't just go around censoring
01:36:53.679 people
01:36:54.719 and again the answer to bad speech
01:36:58.320 is better speech right that has always
01:37:00.159 been the answer but here's the big
01:37:01.119 problem
01:37:01.679 once they silence you they can then make
01:37:04.239 up whatever they want because people all
01:37:05.360 the time here's what's worse
01:37:06.560 alex and this is you personally but the
01:37:08.639 problem is when they silence someone
01:37:10.880 with a censor someone
01:37:12.239 and then that person's not the that's
01:37:14.719 that's not the target anymore
01:37:16.159 they look for another target and they
01:37:17.679 invariably go left
01:37:19.440 they invariably exactly get on a power
01:37:22.239 trip
01:37:22.960 but hold on a second the left is not
01:37:25.360 left enough
01:37:26.320 so if you're a centrist they'll call you
01:37:28.480 all right yeah
01:37:29.440 because you need to be compliant
01:37:31.840 completely with the ideology if you're
01:37:33.840 not compliant
01:37:34.960 they they will they keep moving what's
01:37:37.440 acceptable
01:37:38.239 and what constitutes racism sexism
01:37:41.040 classism homophobia transphobia
01:37:42.880 it's a power grab but they keep changing
01:37:45.360 it and they move the line
01:37:46.880 or orwell talked about this in 1984 yeah
01:37:49.600 he was like
01:37:50.560 if you ban all the words if all you you
01:37:53.119 will you
01:37:53.760 literally you will be you will change
01:37:56.880 thoughts because you you can't have all
01:37:59.840 the i forget
01:38:00.560 orwell's words on uh on
01:38:03.679 producing language he said he said what
01:38:05.679 they want to reduce the language
01:38:07.440 where no one's even able to communicate
01:38:09.040 and that's the goal so we think of it as
01:38:10.639 a leftist thing that's out of control no
01:38:13.119 i paraphrased it and i [ __ ] it up but
01:38:14.719 the point is what they didn't see
01:38:17.040 they didn't use hindsight they didn't
01:38:19.360 they well they didn't it's called
01:38:20.800 sock well that what they did it's so
01:38:22.719 hard to talk with you
01:38:23.920 what they didn't do is they didn't look
01:38:26.960 joey they didn't
01:38:30.080 look to where this goes they didn't
01:38:31.679 understand they didn't extrapolate they
01:38:33.600 didn't say or maybe some of them
01:38:34.960 did and some of them wanted to go if you
01:38:37.119 start if you start censoring
01:38:38.960 there's a real pr and i know people are
01:38:40.560 saying no you should censor people that
01:38:42.400 say terrible things because they
01:38:43.520 influence our children and
01:38:45.520 you you can't but joe it's a power grab
01:38:48.560 they get off once they've got one scalp
01:38:50.800 they're going to scalp everybody
01:38:51.920 including themselves and that's the
01:38:53.199 motivation of the people that are doing
01:38:54.960 it
01:38:55.280 that's not what i'm concerned with what
01:38:56.719 i'm concerned with is the problem itself
01:38:59.119 because you keep finding a new target
01:39:02.719 you keep
01:39:03.360 finding a new a new person who's doing
01:39:06.480 something that's
01:39:07.119 that's what i'm saying they don't want
01:39:08.000 to give up they want more more more but
01:39:09.679 it's not that they're trying to grab
01:39:11.440 power it's just you're always trying
01:39:13.360 look you've you've started the game yeah
01:39:15.840 they're losers that want to control
01:39:17.360 reality because they're projecting their
01:39:18.800 own hatred for themselves on us you
01:39:20.080 don't think part of it is that they want
01:39:21.600 power to control the discussion
01:39:23.040 there's most certainly a part of that
01:39:24.719 yeah that's a part that's human nature
01:39:26.480 but joe you just said i'm hard to
01:39:28.400 deal with well because you talk over
01:39:30.159 people when they're talking you don't
01:39:31.600 let them get the full you've been
01:39:32.639 talking a lot
01:39:33.360 you get you don't let people get a full
01:39:35.520 thought out they're
01:39:36.480 in tim does it like when he's thought
01:39:40.639 what i was saying is he's talking and
01:39:42.159 you you jump in and the problem is i
01:39:44.320 know you have some things to say but
01:39:46.000 then you [ __ ] with the thing that's
01:39:47.440 coming out of the other person okay
01:39:48.560 explain to me how the sensors are loving
01:39:50.159 people that's what you're trying to do
01:39:51.280 not saying they love people i'm saying
01:39:53.040 they don't they they're not
01:39:54.560 looking at it correctly because the way
01:39:57.040 they're looking at it they think they're
01:39:58.159 doing a good thing and they're going to
01:39:59.360 usher for some
01:40:00.400 utopian uh world of communication where
01:40:03.679 people are only saying the things they
01:40:04.880 agree with
01:40:05.679 the problem with that is you don't find
01:40:07.760 out who's right unless you get everybody
01:40:09.360 talking
01:40:09.920 but still i agree the only way it's
01:40:12.000 worse than that you can't have an echo
01:40:13.520 chamber
01:40:14.320 it's dangerous echo chambers are
01:40:16.560 dangerous and in what tech has done
01:40:18.800 is created these left-wing ideological
01:40:21.040 echo chambers
01:40:22.000 i totally agree and they're also forcing
01:40:24.239 people into self-censorship
01:40:25.840 because if you don't comply with the
01:40:27.920 rules that they've set forth
01:40:29.280 then you get banned so you comply and
01:40:31.760 you you you find
01:40:33.040 you find people it is a cult ideal
01:40:36.400 ideologically like this listen it is a
01:40:39.119 cult
01:40:39.760 joe i think there's a lot of these
01:40:41.199 cultures what i'm trying to say to you
01:40:42.719 is you've
01:40:43.199 never been not smoking weed with me on
01:40:45.360 air
01:40:46.239 you need i know it's a bummer we should
01:40:47.920 have had you come in a week you're
01:40:57.119 donald trump is going to win you think
01:40:59.040 so but then the democrats are going to
01:41:00.560 contest it
01:41:01.440 and we're going to have the 79 days but
01:41:03.600 why are all the polls showing that joe
01:41:05.760 biden is in the lead do you think it's
01:41:06.880 all possible
01:41:07.360 like last time they said hillary was
01:41:08.800 gonna win yeah but these are the post
01:41:10.560 post uh election polls joe what i want
01:41:12.880 to do is talk to you right now
01:41:14.400 why are you talking like that he's like
01:41:16.159 a funny he's a conspiracy phone sex
01:41:17.920 operator
01:41:20.000 right now he's the only one here drunk
01:41:23.040 this is a real problem
01:41:24.400 tim dylan he's tim hills that's not how
01:41:26.159 tim dylan talks tim dillon's looking at
01:41:27.920 you right now do you
01:41:28.800 do you really think that trump is going
01:41:30.080 to win because he's close now he's going
01:41:32.000 to win big
01:41:32.639 interesting really but they're going to
01:41:34.320 think that but but they're going
01:41:35.920 listen i was not trying to interrupt you
01:41:38.239 earlier
01:41:39.360 well you this is how you talk it's okay
01:41:41.199 you you're you're there you're going
01:41:43.040 you've got to laugh
01:41:45.840 you've talked twice as much in our last
01:41:47.199 four-hour podcast i love it this is the
01:41:49.280 sober joe rogan
01:41:51.760 let's get back to this trump what were
01:41:53.520 we arguing about about political
01:41:54.560 correctness i don't know but you were
01:41:55.679 saying that we weren't arguing he was
01:41:57.040 saying that the senator's agreeing with
01:41:58.480 you the censors some of the sensors are
01:42:00.320 trying to do the right thing yes
01:42:02.239 and that you were saying listen it's
01:42:03.920 deeper than that and then that's where
01:42:05.679 we left off
01:42:06.320 it's all been scientifically set up
01:42:07.920 where they always say oh we're for
01:42:09.280 outliers now
01:42:10.480 and dog whistles it's all about
01:42:12.840 normalizing centralized control
01:42:15.280 big technos it's psychological
01:42:16.800 algorithms it's totally destructive
01:42:19.280 china that has people in muslims in
01:42:21.600 death camps
01:42:22.480 christians in death camps buddhists and
01:42:24.080 death camps
01:42:25.600 is trying to totally normalize
01:42:28.480 censorship here domestically
01:42:30.320 when the whole left is involved with
01:42:31.840 communist china through big tech it
01:42:33.360 doesn't say a word about them they have
01:42:34.719 no
01:42:35.280 moral high ground to stand on joe well
01:42:38.880 we have a real problem in this society
01:42:40.960 when when it comes to tech
01:42:42.320 first of all because all the people that
01:42:44.000 are on the moral high ground who are
01:42:45.199 buying iphones you know where those
01:42:46.719 things are being made
01:42:48.080 like we all we all know everybody knows
01:42:50.080 and i admit it i admit it
01:42:51.440 i admit it as well there's no iphones
01:42:53.199 that are being made in ohio with highly
01:42:55.360 skilled workers that are paid
01:42:56.960 an excellent wage and they have great
01:42:58.800 health care benefits
01:43:00.239 that's not what's happening i don't know
01:43:01.920 why but that's not what's happening sure
01:43:03.920 they've decided that it's better to make
01:43:06.239 them cheaper
01:43:07.199 or better to have a higher profit margin
01:43:09.360 and make them in
01:43:10.639 other countries or at least they decided
01:43:12.239 that initially and now they're stuck
01:43:14.320 let me ask you this who do you think is
01:43:17.280 going to win
01:43:17.920 in fact i will be very subdued now since

01:46:28.560 79 days of hell let me ask you this who
01:46:31.280 cares
01:46:31.920 you when did you decide to try to escape
01:46:35.040 california well i told you the looting
01:46:37.119 with the looting hand
01:46:38.080 you told me off-air yeah i had zero
01:46:40.560 faith
01:46:41.199 in their ability to uh maintain law and
01:46:43.679 order because
01:46:44.960 if you're gonna pay all that money in
01:46:46.320 taxes i feel like you should at least
01:46:48.480 feel like they're protecting things
01:46:50.320 and when they were just letting them
01:46:52.320 smash windows and cops were told
01:46:54.000 to stand down particularly in santa
01:46:55.840 monica there was like direct orders and
01:46:57.760 the sheriff was
01:46:58.800 you know being widely criticized for
01:47:00.400 this they were told to stand down while
01:47:02.400 these people were smashing and looting
01:47:03.679 things
01:47:04.480 um when when they were doing that i was
01:47:06.320 like well
01:47:07.520 you can't live in a place where that's
01:47:09.199 being tolerated because this is
01:47:10.880 this this this goes from stores
01:47:14.239 to you know they'll move to nightclubs
01:47:16.800 and move to restaurants they'll decide
01:47:19.760 it had nothing to do with george floyd
01:47:21.679 no it had nothing to do with him i agree
01:47:24.080 those restaurants those stores had
01:47:26.159 nothing to do with george floyd and now
01:47:27.920 like in minnesota minneapolis
01:47:29.920 the crime rate's like triple the police
01:47:31.679 won't even show up they're like people
01:47:32.960 like why are you even paying you yeah so
01:47:34.960 what do you think both of you
01:47:37.040 mr dylan what is the end game of this
01:47:39.440 i'm going to finish my
01:47:40.239 my answer okay so i'm not done yet it
01:47:41.920 was also that there was restrictions
01:47:44.080 that were put in place that didn't make
01:47:45.280 any sense to me
01:47:46.320 there's restrictions for restaurants
01:47:48.000 restrictions for comedy clubs restrict
01:47:49.679 restrictions for gyms like why can't you
01:47:51.840 just wear them
01:47:52.800 churches clothes but all but walmart's
01:47:55.040 open well why are churches closed but
01:47:56.880 why is it okay to protest
01:47:58.719 why is everybody okay why is everybody
01:48:00.880 letting people protest
01:48:02.000 right why aren't they saying listen i
01:48:04.000 understand your your
01:48:05.199 want and desire to protest but
01:48:06.880 understand that you're most likely
01:48:08.800 contributing to the spread of this virus
01:48:10.639 because that's a fact right even if you
01:48:12.320 support the protests
01:48:14.719 yeah the end game seems to be if you let
01:48:17.840 society get bad enough people will then
01:48:19.920 accept
01:48:20.639 all these more draconian security
01:48:23.679 measures and
01:48:24.560 and censorship across the board do you
01:48:26.560 think that's what's going on with
01:48:27.760 california like why do you think they've
01:48:29.920 kept california locked down this much
01:48:32.719 they want to kill the u.s economy
01:48:34.320 china's been open for six months they
01:48:36.480 admit it's it's leaked out that they're
01:48:38.000 doing this to kill the us economy
01:48:39.440 remember
01:48:39.760 it's leaked out how uh let's come out
01:48:42.719 democratic party
01:48:43.840 uh reports it's it's it's been stated
01:48:46.880 you heard democrats all over the news
01:48:48.080 say we wanted depression to make trump
01:48:50.000 look bad
01:48:50.719 who said this uh bill maher yeah but
01:48:53.760 bill maher is not a part of the
01:48:54.960 democratic party he's a comic i don't
01:48:56.560 know but i used it
01:48:57.840 but he jokes around about that like look
01:49:00.239 okay we'll crash the economy okay well
01:49:01.920 regardless when jews try to
01:49:03.760 or baptist in new york try to have an
01:49:05.520 event the police show up and arrest him
01:49:07.520 but then when antifa or blm was around
01:49:09.520 burn stuff down the mayor says it's
01:49:10.960 great
01:49:11.360 and the mayor said de blasio said this
01:49:13.280 is legitimate
01:49:15.040 antifa is legitimate your church isn't
01:49:16.800 your synagogue isn't so it's power it's
01:49:18.960 selective enforcement
01:49:20.320 it's martial law i have articles right
01:49:22.960 here because everything i brought today
01:49:23.920 i have the proof
01:49:24.960 abc news is reporting in blue cities in
01:49:27.520 texas
01:49:28.639 that they're going to come to your house
01:49:29.760 and demand a coveted test and if you
01:49:31.679 don't they're going to arrest you
01:49:33.199 well the federal and state courts they
01:49:35.040 can't do that where is that being said
01:49:37.840 el paso texas but i want to bring you
01:49:39.840 back to what you're saying about crash
01:49:41.119 the economy you use bill maher as an
01:49:42.800 example and i just don't think that's a
01:49:44.080 credible example because he's a comic
01:49:45.360 book well he said that
01:49:46.239 yeah but he's a comic and they always
01:49:48.159 play this
01:49:49.280 the comics have bigger coverage than
01:49:50.800 news people now that's what colbert and
01:49:52.639 all them poses
01:49:53.599 people alex you can't use him
01:49:56.800 as an example of someone who's a
01:49:59.440 politician
01:50:00.400 who is calling i think for the economy
01:50:02.480 strategically if i was a democrat
01:50:04.400 i wouldn't want things to open up again
01:50:06.320 until trump was out right agreed
01:50:08.320 i mean that's true
01:50:12.719 shut down china admits they're using the
01:50:14.639 virus to keep us shut down
01:50:15.920 i think he's a bio weapon we'll actually
01:50:18.159 give you an hour-long treatise i'll go
01:50:19.520 with 19 okay
01:50:20.320 we'll we'll get to that momentarily okay
01:50:21.840 i don't want to anger you though before
01:50:23.920 before we no i love being here i'll sit
01:50:25.520 here and like tell fart jokes if you
01:50:26.719 want
01:50:27.599 i'd rather get drunk and just have a
01:50:28.880 good time before we get to that
01:50:30.880 [ __ ] but you said something that i want
01:50:33.520 you to back up you said that the
01:50:35.280 democrats are trying i'm not
01:50:37.040 denying the possibility that this is the
01:50:39.119 case but this seems like if that was the
01:50:41.599 case it would be a
01:50:42.560 grand conspiracy that would at least
01:50:44.800 have you'd have to have some evidence of
01:50:46.800 this to make that statement
01:50:48.400 that they're trying or they want to
01:50:50.159 crash the economy
01:50:51.440 because they they want to to maintain
01:50:54.560 power
01:50:55.119 and to change censorship and to change
01:50:57.760 the way
01:50:58.480 there are okay we've had governor newsom
01:51:01.280 we've had governor
01:51:02.400 um cuomo whitmer cuomo
01:51:05.440 exactly all say the economy isn't going
01:51:08.719 to be open because trump's done a bad
01:51:10.400 job
01:51:11.040 we're not going to open it until he's
01:51:12.239 gone and then whitmer has even come out
01:51:13.679 but it's true wait a minute newsome has
01:51:15.280 openly said that
01:51:16.719 you sure yeah type it in i mean what do
01:51:19.599 you think
01:51:20.000 he said i've never i've listened i'm a
01:51:22.000 criticism i've i'm a critic of newsom
01:51:24.159 because of his uh this he's becoming an
01:51:26.480 autocrat he's just
01:51:27.520 his winery's open but there's a lot of
01:51:29.920 issues right there's a there's a lot of
01:51:31.760 issues so that
01:51:32.800 they they close so many things joe joe
01:51:35.360 joe
01:51:36.639 globalism was about selling america off
01:51:38.719 and bankrupting us under cloud
01:51:40.639 strategy fine but don't don't change the
01:51:42.719 subject i'm not
01:51:43.920 specifically what newsom has said
01:51:46.960 um you can pull it up just like i told
01:51:48.400 you about the atm what did he say
01:51:50.480 that you think and again i'm not a fan
01:51:53.599 of him
01:51:54.239 i'm a critic listen i i think you got to
01:51:56.320 give people grown adults
01:51:58.000 the choice if they just look we don't
01:52:01.360 have overrun hospitals we don't have
01:52:03.119 people dying in record numbers
01:52:05.199 we don't have five percent death rates
01:52:07.679 the cases and the deaths are increasing
01:52:10.320 that is true but as long as there's a
01:52:12.800 disease
01:52:13.360 they're going to increase the question
01:52:15.520 is at what rate
01:52:16.880 and the people that are dying there's
01:52:18.400 never many of them have never morbidity
01:52:20.320 factors
01:52:20.800 it's never about the death rate it's
01:52:22.320 always about increased infection
01:52:24.080 because the death rates weigh down right
01:52:25.599 now it is rejection
01:52:27.679 they're gonna say it's flu and alex the
01:52:30.159 cold they're gonna count
01:52:32.000 you get me again when when you say the
01:52:34.800 deaths increase
01:52:36.000 that is going to happen the question is
01:52:38.880 by what rate
01:52:40.159 and how many right you take the normal
01:52:44.080 and pneumonia and morbidity like they
01:52:45.760 did this year and you add that to the
01:52:47.840 number they've already run the same scam
01:52:49.599 and so whatever they don't count fluids
01:52:51.280 of death or pneumonia anymore they only
01:52:52.880 like they all kind of cove because they
01:52:54.080 get money on the chart
01:52:55.360 right they get 50 plus thousand dollars
01:52:57.679 when they call it a cove of death
01:52:59.440 plus when they say that they get 13 000
01:53:02.000 to say it's a covet patient
01:53:03.520 and they get uh 29 000 or whatever extra
01:53:07.119 when they intubate somebody
01:53:08.880 and so now since when is like congress
01:53:10.880 saying how to do medicine
01:53:13.199 well the isn't the idea that they're
01:53:15.360 doing this to give money to these
01:53:17.040 hospitals
01:53:17.920 to help them in the middle of a pandemic
01:53:20.000 yeah so these but then the hospitals
01:53:21.760 reasons code everything is covered to
01:53:23.599 get the money that's come out
01:53:24.880 they killed most people that died died
01:53:26.719 nursing homes or died from intimation
01:53:28.639 when it's an autoimmune event and you
01:53:30.400 don't want intubation
01:53:32.000 it's intubation that's killing you but
01:53:33.280 they initially thought you did but
01:53:34.880 that's why they're not because it was
01:53:35.920 responsible
01:53:36.480 thank god the numbers went down because
01:53:37.760 they stopped intimating yes so now it's
01:53:40.000 all about everyone's being before
01:53:42.159 there's this high death rate
01:53:43.760 because they were intubating and they
01:53:45.520 were counting and they were killing old
01:53:46.880 people
01:53:47.360 as soon as they stopped shipping folks
01:53:48.639 to old homes they weren't getting
01:53:50.000 vitamin d there's no sun
01:53:51.360 it went like this so so infections like
01:53:54.480 this
01:53:54.800 you pulled the grafts yeah you're like
01:53:56.480 what's your science pull it up and you
01:53:58.000 know
01:53:58.239 infections like this deaths like this
01:54:00.239 right well you're going up and down
01:54:01.360 right death down
01:54:02.480 now what did gavin newsom say though
01:54:05.840 that you when you said that he said it's
01:54:07.599 not going to get better until trump's
01:54:09.119 out of office
01:54:11.040 well it's it's whitmer that said that
01:54:12.719 specifically and he said cuomo because i
01:54:14.800 remember that too but he was just
01:54:16.080 basically like well
01:54:17.119 i want to be friends with trump there's
01:54:18.320 been a bad response we've got to keep
01:54:19.679 the lockdown going and
01:54:20.800 you know until trump does this wrong
01:54:22.159 until we have a change it's going to
01:54:23.280 continue on
01:54:24.400 and then it's always about the power
01:54:25.679 grab like oh it's two years we have to
01:54:27.679 do it no it's now it's
01:54:28.880 first it's 15 days to keep the hospitals
01:54:30.800 empty and then it's uh
01:54:33.440 then it's oh six months and now it's two
01:54:35.520 years and then gates said like a week
01:54:37.040 ago
01:54:37.599 it's ten years and now they've got the
01:54:40.000 the people
01:54:40.719 vouching and they're saying no it never
01:54:42.320 ends you never shake hands
01:54:44.159 and under the u.n rules they say don't
01:54:46.239 look at someone
01:54:47.280 and turn your head so in europe you can
01:54:50.000 type this in
01:54:51.679 uh citizens in the uk told do not look
01:54:54.159 at other people and turn your head it's
01:54:56.000 cult
01:54:56.639 programming man i think it's a pretty
01:54:58.239 common talking point and
01:54:59.760 some people agree with it like a lot of
01:55:01.040 democrats would say yeah it's not gonna
01:55:02.880 get better until trump is out because
01:55:04.480 trump has made a mess of it i don't
01:55:05.840 think trump's done the best yeah that's
01:55:06.960 what he said
01:55:07.679 but that's that's a common what could he
01:55:09.520 have done better
01:55:10.880 well done better he shut down flights
01:55:12.960 from china
01:55:13.920 in february when when pelosi's running
01:55:16.400 around in chinatown saying yeah but
01:55:18.560 i think it's a pretty common belief that
01:55:20.000 they're saying listen we so i don't
01:55:21.760 think it's a
01:55:22.400 conspiracy or i don't think like you
01:55:23.840 have to fight a source i think it's like
01:55:25.440 they believe if he wasn't in that it
01:55:27.760 won't get better until he's gone
01:55:29.199 so i don't think they actively are
01:55:30.960 trying to make it better
01:55:32.480 until he's gone exactly exactly they
01:55:34.960 want to keep the crisis going
01:55:36.480 i do see what you're saying i just want
01:55:38.159 to know if there's evidence i want to
01:55:39.520 know if there's an actual statement
01:55:41.119 where he said after when trump leaves
01:55:44.719 then we'll open back up that's well
01:55:45.920 that's actually what whitmer said
01:55:47.040 specifically but
01:55:48.320 he said some more things but well let's
01:55:50.000 find where we're going from memory here
01:55:51.599 i mean my god i understand
01:55:52.880 but that's why i'm challenging agreement
01:55:55.760 but i'm
01:55:56.560 challenge you on this because these are
01:55:58.560 people online
01:56:00.080 are going to want to challenge you on
01:56:01.440 this right so i want that's what they
01:56:03.440 loved about our last interview over a
01:56:04.880 year and a half ago
01:56:05.920 which they loved was that people could
01:56:07.520 go and actually check the stuff i was
01:56:08.639 saying
01:56:09.199 yeah no matter how crazy a lot of it is
01:56:10.639 true so i want to find that quote now
01:56:12.800 see if whitmer said that it won't get
01:56:14.960 better until trump's out of office
01:56:17.199 in terms of the lockdown yeah whitman
01:56:19.119 merchants whitmer lockdown won in until
01:56:21.440 trump's house
01:56:22.000 didn't she lose some court case recently
01:56:24.639 yes
01:56:25.520 her supreme court but also federal
01:56:27.119 courts have ruled
01:56:28.880 across the country that you can't order
01:56:30.719 churches to wear masks
01:56:32.080 you can't order social distancing it's
01:56:33.920 all just getting us to comply
01:56:36.560 don't you think it's a good idea to
01:56:38.639 encourage people to wear masks if
01:56:40.400 they're going into large gatherings a
01:56:41.840 lot of studies a lot of studies show
01:56:43.280 that doesn't even protect you listen
01:56:44.800 listen trump told the truth a few days
01:56:46.880 ago when he came out and he said
01:56:48.400 we're never going to control this we
01:56:50.320 have to learn herd immunity
01:56:51.840 or if you're really scared of a take a
01:56:53.199 vaccine and the head epidemiologist of
01:56:55.440 rockefeller
01:56:56.719 uh hospital came out and said that and
01:56:58.480 got banned on youtube i mean listen
01:57:00.159 italy did social distancing italy did
01:57:02.000 masks italy did everything you were
01:57:03.679 supposed to do
01:57:04.880 and they're getting clobbered again so
01:57:07.920 that makes me think that maybe it's not
01:57:10.239 a bad idea to do these things but they
01:57:11.760 don't seem to
01:57:12.639 they don't seem to believe that they
01:57:13.920 didn't second sweden didn't do any of it
01:57:16.400 and it's the lowest death rate in europe
01:57:18.480 right but it's also a
01:57:19.760 country of small villages they have a
01:57:21.599 whole different way of life over there
01:57:22.960 well i mean italy italy
01:57:24.239 is a bunch of three generations living
01:57:25.840 in one house yeah yeah
01:57:27.440 and and they have they're the oldest
01:57:29.040 people in europe yes so yeah and they
01:57:31.040 need to they need
01:57:31.760 sunlight they need they smoke they're
01:57:33.440 all good food try finding a gym over
01:57:35.360 there
01:57:36.800 they smoke every time i [ __ ] go there
01:57:39.040 it's hard to find a gym
01:57:39.920 they listen exactly they were rational
01:57:42.639 joe have a restaurant joe i came out
01:57:44.639 eight months ago and i and i and i was
01:57:46.719 selling this stuff but you get i said
01:57:48.000 get at the store
01:57:49.199 vitamin d vitamin c zinc and zinc
01:57:52.400 if you have that on the nih website it
01:57:54.719 can't
01:57:56.080 according to the nha nih website cannot
01:57:59.360 replicate inside the mitochondria
01:58:01.760 where the virus plugs into the cell and
01:58:03.199 makes it replicate okay
01:58:05.360 and so i just mean like jones claims
01:58:07.360 he's got a cure no it's not a cure
01:58:09.280 if you've got sunlight and zinc and and
01:58:11.440 vitamin c and all these things you need
01:58:12.800 it's
01:58:13.119 very hard to get these things that's why
01:58:15.119 it's old people in nursing homes that
01:58:16.960 have been outside in years
01:58:18.159 that are dying so easily now falci
01:58:20.400 finally two months ago came out and said
01:58:22.080 you need vitamin d you need vitamin c
01:58:24.080 that is true and young jamie takes
01:58:25.840 vitamin d and he kicked in a day
01:58:28.560 yes and vitamin c and zinc young jamie
01:58:32.000 was feeling bad for a day
01:58:33.760 but i don't want to argue joe i want to
01:58:35.599 just say i love bill gates
01:58:38.320 okay let i love i use windows i'm
01:58:41.040 looking for tell me
01:58:41.920 i can't find whitmer's quote specific
01:58:43.679 quote that says that
01:58:45.679 there's lots of quotes about them going
01:58:46.880 back and forth obviously because they've
01:58:48.000 had a public battle i just think anybody
01:58:50.000 like that whether it's bill gates or
01:58:51.440 bezos or anybody who's a billionaire if
01:58:53.199 they
01:58:53.520 say here's the suggested course of
01:58:55.040 action they have to expect that they're
01:58:56.639 going to be criticized and a lot of
01:58:57.920 these guys don't like
01:58:59.199 taking any criticism when they they're
01:59:01.119 issuing edicts
01:59:02.400 these are billionaires that are saying
01:59:04.159 this is how
01:59:05.440 we're going to live yeah that's the next
01:59:06.800 big question strange though that bill
01:59:09.520 gates who is not a health expert
01:59:11.599 is all of a sudden one of the leading
01:59:12.880 voices yes it's strange that's my
01:59:15.760 seriousness that's my next question yeah
01:59:17.440 why is bill gates who's not a doctor
01:59:20.080 suddenly on tv telling me
01:59:21.840 how my life's going to go and what i'm
01:59:23.840 going to do this is the most important
01:59:24.960 part why is this a
01:59:26.320 a big project for him well he's also a
01:59:28.320 guy that wanted to shoot a missile of
01:59:29.679 dust into the atmosphere to help climate
01:59:31.199 change i mean
01:59:32.560 very few people in history have had the
01:59:33.840 resources to even think of doing
01:59:35.760 something like that that's right he
01:59:36.719 wants to have jet spray
01:59:38.400 chemicals to block the sun right and the
01:59:40.880 scientists went
01:59:41.679 great no good they went not a good idea
01:59:44.719 so and then if you quite call him on
01:59:46.400 that if you call him on that he goes
01:59:47.840 the conspiracy lies and the conspiracy
01:59:50.480 theories it's like no we're just asking
01:59:52.239 you why you understand there's no
01:59:54.080 space he went on cbs news they go 80
01:59:57.280 of those taking your vaccine trial
01:59:58.639 getting very sick some are dying he's
02:00:00.000 like well that's just how it is
02:00:01.679 you can pull these clips up what yeah i
02:00:04.880 said that's just how it is
02:00:06.320 yeah he said well the fda is going to
02:00:08.719 approve it
02:00:12.719 he's beat red look at you you're
02:00:14.639 blending in with the walls
02:00:16.239 because but yeah it's a problem that's
02:00:18.960 hilarious
02:00:20.560 that's a problem it's a problem you know
02:00:22.639 i'm kind of [ __ ] this is
02:00:24.320 this is for two years they said trump
02:00:27.199 worked for i've heard of
02:00:28.400 political mudslinging my whole life for
02:00:30.719 two years
02:00:31.520 they said trump was an agent of russia
02:00:33.920 he was an asset of russia
02:00:35.920 the president then they did a whole
02:00:37.520 report and then it came out that he
02:00:39.520 wasn't there was no proof of it with the
02:00:41.119 cia the nfc everybody
02:00:42.639 and then they went like this he went
02:00:44.159 well we might have been wrong about that
02:00:45.760 i mean
02:00:46.159 it was mine disturbing things to me was
02:00:48.639 when ted cruz was cross-examining
02:00:51.040 comey when he was asking him questions
02:00:52.800 about what they did with evidence and
02:00:54.560 how they doctored evidence what do you
02:00:56.239 got jamie

02:02:31.920 whitmer when trump leaves office quote
02:02:34.480 she was almost there there was a
02:02:36.000 kidnapping plot against her
02:02:37.760 no it's whitmer which 15 percent won't
02:02:40.880 end until trump gone that's just come on
02:02:42.800 right lockdowns won't end till trump
02:02:45.360 gone try that
02:02:46.000 whatever i know it's true whitmer
02:02:48.480 lockdowns won't until trump gone he'll
02:02:50.560 find it
02:02:51.599 um yeah the plot to assassinate her what
02:02:54.320 the [ __ ] it was
02:02:55.440 like kidnapper that was weird but i
02:02:57.199 predicted up front that it was gonna be
02:02:59.119 fbi provocateurs and it turned out the
02:03:00.719 two leaders were fbi informants
02:03:02.960 what what's even crazier is 52 percent
02:03:05.040 of the citizens of michigan agreed with
02:03:06.800 the plot
02:03:07.920 that's a joke
02:03:08.660 [Laughter]
02:03:11.599 good one going to edit that part
02:03:14.880 where you say that's a joke joe rogan's
02:03:16.639 guess calls for kidnapping
02:03:18.080 this is outrageous d platform
02:03:22.960 when i went on alex's show alex goes
02:03:24.480 snopes always goes and finds like jokes
02:03:26.159 he makes it there go
02:03:27.119 they go oh correction hillary clinton is
02:03:29.440 not an oompa loop
02:03:30.719 did you guys see that um brett
02:03:33.119 weinstein's unity 2020 account was also
02:03:35.840 banned from twitter
02:03:37.040 just told me that his unity 2020 account
02:03:39.280 was which was calling for a third party
02:03:41.040 was calling for unity between people on
02:03:42.800 the right and the left
02:03:43.760 to get together and have conversations
02:03:45.599 and and perhaps even have a
02:03:47.599 an alternative candidate that's
02:03:49.199 outrageous well he's a [ __ ] scholar
02:03:51.199 and he's a guy who became famous because
02:03:53.280 he was a professor
02:03:54.239 at evergreen university and the leftists
02:03:56.960 took over the course and they said we're
02:03:58.159 going to shut it down and whites can't
02:03:59.520 come one day a month
02:04:00.639 they they had and then they banned him
02:04:02.400 yes well it
02:04:03.679 well just banned him they went looking
02:04:06.239 for him in the parking lot
02:04:08.719 baseball bats yeah it was terrifying so
02:04:10.800 let me ask you this the
02:04:12.000 the principal was going along with
02:04:13.520 everything literally they yelled the
02:04:15.360 principal don't
02:04:16.320 gesture with your hands because you're
02:04:18.639 threatening us but
02:04:19.760 he was talking like this
02:04:23.119 british universities like oxford i
02:04:24.960 think's the one look it up
02:04:26.400 oxford or cambridge one of the big ones
02:04:28.159 you can't clap
02:04:30.239 it's a microaggression joe oh that's so
02:04:32.400 crazy but this is what we were talking
02:04:34.320 about for years and people were saying
02:04:36.000 why are you concerned with what happens
02:04:37.520 in the universities
02:04:38.560 it's the same thing we were saying about
02:04:40.079 censorship because it [ __ ]
02:04:41.760 it keeps going it doesn't stop when you
02:04:44.639 when you allow that kind of nonsense in
02:04:46.560 universities
02:04:47.360 those kids graduate and they want to
02:04:49.040 carry these goofy [ __ ] practices
02:04:51.199 into all of these corporations
02:04:54.960 now that's one of the things i wrote
02:04:56.000 down i wanted to ask you joe and tim
02:04:57.920 dillon
02:05:00.079 what what happens how where do they stop
02:05:02.480 because they're going to keep running
02:05:03.520 until they hit opposition which is
02:05:04.880 starting to happen
02:05:05.679 how far does it go i was hoping there
02:05:07.360 was going to be some sort of a
02:05:08.880 federal regulation i was hoping that
02:05:10.719 trump was going to step in and they were
02:05:12.159 going to
02:05:13.280 amend the first amendment to include
02:05:14.800 social media because i think
02:05:16.560 what you're what you're seeing now the
02:05:19.119 the argument that these are just
02:05:21.360 just private corporations i don't think
02:05:23.520 that argument is valid anymore because
02:05:25.199 the impact that they have
02:05:26.480 the significance of being able to speak
02:05:28.239 or not being able to speak
02:05:29.760 to speak has massive implications on our
02:05:32.320 election
02:05:32.880 we see this with the new york post's
02:05:34.239 election meddling we see it with the new
02:05:36.000 york post being censored with this
02:05:37.199 hunter biden story
02:05:38.400 whether you agree with the story being
02:05:39.599 leaked or not the the fact that the new
02:05:41.520 york [ __ ] post
02:05:43.040 which is a legitimate newspaper as
02:05:45.119 outrageous as they are
02:05:46.320 and the fact that the [ __ ] white
02:05:48.079 house press secretary gets banned from
02:05:49.840 twitter
02:05:50.400 for for tweeting that link that's where
02:05:52.000 it is this is crazy i mean i think it
02:05:53.599 leads to
02:05:54.159 it's sadly at least the violence because
02:05:55.760 if you take everybody's ability to
02:05:57.199 communicate away there's nothing left to
02:05:58.880 do but commit acts of violence and by
02:06:00.960 the way that's a kennedy
02:06:02.000 quote those that make peaceful
02:06:03.440 revolutions maybe found something this
02:06:04.960 is as close as i could get to what was
02:06:06.880 what he's asking for to be found okay
02:06:09.360 the trump virus response is the worst in
02:06:11.679 the globe she said
02:06:12.960 if you're tired of the of lockdowns or
02:06:15.840 you're tired of wearing masks or
02:06:18.000 you wish you were in church this morning
02:06:20.079 or watching college football or your
02:06:22.719 kids were getting
02:06:23.760 in-person instruction it's time for a
02:06:26.159 change in this country
02:06:27.360 and that's why we've got to elect joe
02:06:29.119 biden i mean that's pretty
02:06:32.960 that's why i mean you you can make that
02:06:35.360 say whatever you want almost
02:06:36.560 yeah but that's the common sense right
02:06:39.599 right the problem is the problem is if
02:06:42.560 you
02:06:42.960 just take it from if you're tired of
02:06:45.119 lockdowns
02:06:46.719 and you you get one you would get one in
02:06:49.199 interpretation of it but if you back it
02:06:50.880 up to
02:06:51.520 the trump virus response is the worst in
02:06:54.159 the globe
02:06:54.880 she said if you're tired of lockdowns so
02:06:57.520 what she's
02:06:58.000 saying i think we're splitting here you
02:06:59.760 mean you're not necessarily
02:07:01.599 because what she's saying i saw a clip
02:07:03.760 of her and please saying that
02:07:05.199 because that's the problem with taking
02:07:06.400 something out of context what she's
02:07:08.239 saying is
02:07:09.199 a wonderful person no i'm not saying
02:07:11.360 that what she's saying is that trump has
02:07:12.880 done such a shitty job
02:07:14.480 that's the reason why we're locked down
02:07:15.840 you can't go i get it they'll get it the
02:07:17.360 headline i don't know if that's true
02:07:18.880 though
02:07:19.440 i think when you've got a contagious
02:07:20.880 disease you got people flying in from
02:07:22.480 europe and china
02:07:23.520 and all these other countries that are
02:07:24.960 expressing you you're go
02:07:26.639 you're going to have spread this is a
02:07:28.000 [ __ ] insanely contagious disease
02:07:29.920 joe one of my favorite parts of your
02:07:31.520 show is when you
02:07:33.280 ask jamie for something then the light
02:07:34.719 turns on when you're looking at it let
02:07:36.079 me ask you this
02:07:37.119 you're in the numerator hammered are you
02:07:38.480 right now on scale one time at all we're
02:07:40.480 into numerology this is when it gets
02:07:42.000 good
02:07:43.119 you better okay
02:07:46.480 let's talk just be nice to me joe
02:07:50.079 i have to be nice to you got me here and
02:07:51.760 i know you are let's get serious
02:07:53.280 everybody wants to hear what i actually
02:07:54.159 have to say
02:07:54.639 okay what was the question you had me on
02:07:58.079 9 11 yes 12 5 55 now
02:08:01.840 one five five five yeah don't connect
02:08:03.520 the dots just i'm in town it's random
02:08:06.560 well you told me you were good at 9 11
02:08:08.320 on purpose yeah that was on purpose
02:08:09.920 yeah it was just fun but this is nothing
02:08:12.400 bad but
02:08:13.040 but this is see do you understand how
02:08:14.880 this quote you could interpret that
02:08:16.880 in a different way like i think the
02:08:19.520 entire
02:08:20.159 democratic party strategy i understand
02:08:22.400 to say trump is to blame for covet
02:08:24.320 and to say the economy shut down till
02:08:25.920 you get them elected that's what she's
02:08:27.760 saying
02:08:28.079 they're all good they're all saying i
02:08:29.679 understand it's like we're gonna end
02:08:31.440 this
02:08:32.400 by endless lockdowns once trump's out if
02:08:34.800 you want to go back to normal do this
02:08:36.320 and their own listen this is an end of
02:08:38.560 civilization event
02:08:39.920 the rockefellers and others put out
02:08:41.360 operation lockstep they're never going
02:08:43.199 to stop this they're going to have
02:08:44.639 coveted tracking they're going to have
02:08:46.000 checkpoints they're going to have
02:08:47.920 apps on your phone so how do we stop
02:08:49.440 this what trump came out and did and
02:08:52.159 said
02:08:53.520 we cannot defeat this with vaccines
02:08:56.719 and with covet tracking with shutdowns
02:08:59.760 it's going to have to be with uh herd
02:09:02.880 immunity
02:09:03.599 which is what the scientist actually
02:09:04.960 brought why can't we beat it with what
02:09:06.800 he beat it with he's 74 and he eats
02:09:08.719 french fries every day
02:09:09.920 this [ __ ] kicked it in four days
02:09:11.679 that's why that's supposed to be a death
02:09:13.040 sentence
02:09:13.679 if you've got vitamin d vitamin c and
02:09:16.480 zinc it's very hard to get okay
02:09:18.079 but clearly he's got more than vitamin d
02:09:20.239 vitamin c and zinc he's got a bunch of
02:09:21.920 medical treatments
02:09:23.040 right well he was given regeneron he was
02:09:24.719 driven things that are expensive and
02:09:26.960 probably not widely available but wait a
02:09:28.560 minute jamie
02:09:29.360 tested positive he's right over there
02:09:31.040 like timmy's young and viral
02:09:32.880 but i'm saying where since since when
02:09:35.440 did something come along
02:09:37.760 civilization is over civilization is
02:09:40.880 over
02:09:41.599 because of this thing that came out of
02:09:43.520 china you're not even supposed to come
02:09:45.199 you want to ask where cove it came from
02:09:46.400 i'm going to ask where it is do you feel
02:09:48.320 better about the disease
02:09:49.520 now that you kicked it so quickly uh
02:09:52.800 i mean how old are you at first how old
02:09:54.400 are you 37. first i was a little worried
02:09:56.480 for the first day i was like
02:09:57.760 oh [ __ ] here we go are we going down
02:09:59.199 like a two week three week four weeks
02:10:00.880 then a letter time
02:10:01.760 months right because you've talked to
02:10:04.079 people on the show that have been [ __ ]
02:10:05.599 up
02:10:06.079 sure yeah how lucky am i going to be
02:10:08.159 today is all right i was thinking that
02:10:09.599 and she's like so taking all the
02:10:11.920 vitamins
02:10:12.639 i mean we got yeah i got all that we had
02:10:14.239 nad and all that stuff too in my system
02:10:15.840 yeah
02:10:16.079 like i don't maybe that helped i'm sure
02:10:17.920 hopefully sure did of course
02:10:20.000 statistically they said five percent of
02:10:21.840 us will be dead it's not even
02:10:23.440 well they thought point one percent okay
02:10:25.440 but what they thought they're the
02:10:26.560 all-powerful gods it's like the u.n says
02:10:28.719 you will not question us big tux says
02:10:30.960 you will not question
02:10:32.159 anything the u.n says meanwhile the
02:10:34.239 union's like oh we shouldn't do a
02:10:35.520 lockdown it's killing millions of people
02:10:36.880 starvation
02:10:37.920 but still it's like worse keeping the
02:10:39.280 lockdown going the united nations said
02:10:41.440 well what do you think should be done i
02:10:44.239 mean i think we should look at something
02:10:45.679 that isn't much worse than the flu and
02:10:47.360 say we all need
02:10:49.360 natural vitamins and nutraceuticals and
02:10:52.000 sunlight
02:10:52.800 and health and people should just know
02:10:54.639 they got to deal with the way it is
02:10:55.920 because
02:10:56.560 we always get diseases we always get
02:10:58.320 viruses we always live with
02:10:59.679 the idea we got to lock society down and
02:11:01.440 go into our houses and
02:11:02.719 this is a post-industrial move
02:11:06.320 that they're using to roll out these
02:11:08.480 systems to keep us locked down in our
02:11:09.840 homes right and if you want to be
02:11:11.119 cynical this is where you step in and
02:11:12.719 say the reason why they want us to be
02:11:14.880 upset and they want the economy to be
02:11:16.480 [ __ ] is because they hate the
02:11:17.679 president and they want him out of
02:11:18.800 office and they want to regain power
02:11:20.400 they want the democrats the american
02:11:22.639 economy the
02:11:23.440 in the image of what they want they want
02:11:24.960 to remake a lot of these these um
02:11:27.119 systems that they feel are for whatever
02:11:29.760 reason
02:11:30.880 uh they just injust or unjust or
02:11:33.440 whatever and they want to use this
02:11:34.719 opportunity to kind of
02:11:35.920 redraw the lines exactly after 9 11.
02:11:38.639 exactly
02:11:39.360 this is the new 911. the u.n and and the
02:11:42.400 davos group all say
02:11:44.000 this is the post-industrial world the
02:11:46.480 great reset i got a copy of it for
02:11:48.159 right here and they say in these
02:11:50.560 documents
02:11:51.520 we are going to reorganize society code
02:11:54.800 that is good to shut down the carbon
02:11:56.239 carbon is bad
02:11:57.440 we're going to end success we're going
02:11:59.040 to end prosperity
02:12:00.560 we're going to track everybody we're
02:12:01.920 going to control their lives all under
02:12:03.440 the name of covet they said all that
02:12:05.119 they said we're going to end success
02:12:06.560 we're going to end prosperity
02:12:08.079 uh yeah in the lockstep the rockefeller
02:12:10.159 document 2010 they say
02:12:12.159 we'll have a viral release or a
02:12:13.599 simulated one that creates total fear
02:12:15.679 while bringing a police state
02:12:17.280 marshall is this available for someone
02:12:18.719 to read absolutely wasn't there
02:12:20.079 something called agenda 21 or something
02:12:21.920 where they were saying we want people
02:12:23.119 living in cities we don't want home
02:12:24.480 ownership
02:12:25.040 compact cities yeah yeah and you were
02:12:27.599 saying it earlier they go oh
02:12:28.960 it's for the greater good that we don't
02:12:30.239 have cars anymore it's for the greater
02:12:31.679 good
02:12:32.320 we have donald trump that's what i was
02:12:33.440 saying what i was doing was give playing
02:12:34.880 devils
02:12:35.440 you were quoting them yeah what i was
02:12:37.119 saying you said that joe you believe in
02:12:39.280 that i was saying that autonomy i do
02:12:40.960 believe in cars too
02:12:42.079 autonomous vehicles are in the future
02:12:45.119 at least likely to be safer than people
02:12:47.599 just driving and texting well it's not
02:12:49.199 safe given
02:12:49.920 control over these corporations and
02:12:51.119 robots and making ourselves obsolete we
02:12:52.560 need to build a pro human future
02:12:54.560 well i'm pro-human but i know you aren't
02:12:57.520 saying you're not joe feller thing from
02:12:59.199 2010
02:13:00.560 sounds a weird
02:13:03.920 i was already looking this up as he
02:13:05.119 mentioned it because i was going down my
02:13:06.719 own little rabbit hole
02:13:07.599 it says when i first started to find it
02:13:09.520 my first search just says there's a
02:13:11.040 small
02:13:12.079 a large conspiracy has been built out of
02:13:13.599 this small grain of truth from this
02:13:14.880 document from 2010.
02:13:16.239 okay that's what it starts to say so i
02:13:17.760 haven't oh is that snopes small
02:13:19.520 grain of truth yeah so snow systems like
02:13:21.599 god it's like i don't think is it snopes
02:13:23.040 that you google
02:13:23.520 let's focus on the grain of truth no who
02:13:25.440 says it's a grain of truth
02:13:27.199 hold on no no it's operation lockstep
02:13:30.560 and it says a global police state will
02:13:32.320 be brought in from a pandemic
02:13:34.639 and there'll be worldwide martial law it
02:13:36.400 actually says it in the document
02:13:38.320 okay it's like they always go like oh
02:13:40.079 there's no hunter emails the
02:13:41.760 emails are real right i love that clock
02:13:44.239 it is weird that they're saying
02:13:45.679 tgg studios is it is weird there's a
02:13:48.480 document okay
02:13:49.440 the rockefeller foundation annual report
02:13:51.599 2010.
02:13:52.560 i'll control f what would you like me to
02:13:54.159 look up
02:13:56.719 uh look up uh police state look up there
02:13:59.440 just look at police state
02:14:00.960 don't forget the exact words i mean
02:14:02.639 let's just go read it for yourself
02:14:04.239 control f police station came up this is
02:14:06.800 just one paper that's it i mean that's
02:14:08.400 the whole pdf is here it's like it's
02:14:09.920 real really really long

02:14:20.480 think they edited it no
02:14:22.239 no it's i mean i can't remember exact
02:14:24.159 words okay well let's look up pandemic
02:14:26.079 look up pandemic
02:14:30.880 pandemic just means widely distributed
02:14:32.719 epidemic means you're actually sick
02:14:34.239 four mentions of the word pandemic okay
02:14:37.199 all right with no network to
02:14:38.960 transfer critical infectious disease
02:14:40.639 information without open lines of
02:14:42.000 communications
02:14:43.040 thousands more fall sick the new in
02:14:45.920 quotes disease
02:14:47.040 becomes an unchecked pandemic by the
02:14:48.960 time the
02:14:50.960 the right expertise is brought to bear
02:14:53.119 on the world government it's
02:14:54.639 too late the disease has spread around
02:14:56.560 the globe in a world of global trade and
02:14:58.880 travel what's traded faster and travels
02:15:01.040 furthest
02:15:01.760 are the microbes in every handshake
02:15:03.280 southeast so what do they what is this
02:15:05.599 in reference to okay it says a few miles
02:15:08.960 east young boy has been hold on don't
02:15:12.079 please go back to that
02:15:13.760 yeah just it's just it's just a scenario
02:15:16.880 that they're painting
02:15:17.840 so make that a little larger no no go
02:15:20.000 back to it
02:15:20.960 just go back to where it was all right
02:15:23.440 the potential pandemic of the few
02:15:25.040 decades have severely tested the world's
02:15:26.480 ability
02:15:27.119 to work across human borders detection
02:15:28.880 remains weak in many parts of the world
02:15:30.639 the public health response has
02:15:32.000 frequently been slow and fragmented
02:15:33.840 the looming threat of infectious disease
02:15:35.520 presents humanity with a new challenge
02:15:37.360 to communicate and collaborate swifter
02:15:40.079 and with greater efficiency than ever
02:15:41.599 before that doesn't sound like they're
02:15:42.960 trying to end the world okay well you're
02:15:44.239 just reading one of these documents i
02:15:45.920 already i can pull up the articles i can
02:15:47.440 show you yourself
02:15:48.239 but this is world government controlled
02:15:50.800 they talk about a worldwide police state
02:15:53.119 you search the term pandemic i'm telling
02:15:54.880 you what's in these things
02:15:56.800 okay uh emerging pandemics the new
02:15:58.880 century sars
02:15:59.920 avion flu and swine flu if we don't move
02:16:02.639 investigated systems of bringing global
02:16:04.560 warming it seems like they're trying to
02:16:05.840 prevent
02:16:06.480 pandemics if we don't move quickly
02:16:08.960 viruses will
02:16:11.280 uh by continuing our drive to invest in
02:16:14.320 systems that coordinate efforts and
02:16:15.920 share information
02:16:17.040 the rockefeller foundation is working
02:16:18.719 together which is the global government
02:16:20.480 controlling all of us
02:16:21.599 to meet the health challenges of an
02:16:24.000 interconnected world
02:16:25.199 is it the perfect analogy terrorism
02:16:27.040 because it's like terrorism exists
02:16:28.480 people want to prevent terrorism but
02:16:29.920 it's like
02:16:30.480 how many rights do you give up in order
02:16:32.318 to do that and then
02:16:34.080 you know all these proactive measures
02:16:35.679 that we take to prevent terrorism a lot
02:16:37.359 of them create more terrorists who
02:16:38.799 i think it's like a balance of like be
02:16:41.920 remaining a free society and dealing
02:16:43.920 with a lot of these men listen i sit
02:16:45.599 here
02:16:46.398 you know we sit and we talk about
02:16:48.000 something and then whether jaime can
02:16:49.519 find it or not becomes the arbiter
02:16:50.799 whether it's real
02:16:51.920 so they found something about an att
02:16:53.519 lobby they didn't find a thing about
02:16:54.879 this
02:16:55.760 i've got the operation lockstep
02:16:58.478 documents where they say
02:16:59.760 we're going to bring in this global
02:17:01.200 authority but you have to
02:17:02.879 then you have to show us those well i
02:17:04.799 mean i i'm sitting here in studio
02:17:07.679 talking to you about this but i
02:17:09.200 understand i understand that's almost
02:17:10.959 what you're saying but we we wanted to
02:17:12.558 try to know everybody else watching this
02:17:14.318 is gonna go look it up well i hope they
02:17:15.599 do they're gonna go crazy
02:17:16.638 i hope we wish we could have found it
02:17:18.718 right then if it's real no no no i know
02:17:20.558 you want to show it but it might be
02:17:22.240 an interpretation of what they're saying
02:17:24.799 like the whitmer now it says
02:17:25.920 specifically
02:17:26.799 the whitmer quote is just a criticism of
02:17:28.638 trump she's been
02:17:30.080 blaming all this lock no whitmer was
02:17:32.398 found by the
02:17:33.200 by the supreme court of michigan and by
02:17:35.040 a federal court to have seized all three
02:17:37.439 branches of governments
02:17:38.638 and basically set up martial law they
02:17:40.080 even used those terms he was overturned
02:17:42.240 saying that quote i i want to when you
02:17:44.638 say if you are sick of lockdown
02:17:46.558 yeah and you're sick of not being able
02:17:47.840 to go to church joe biden should be
02:17:49.439 elected
02:17:50.080 agree that is not a huge jump from what
02:17:51.840 he said no it's not a huge jump yeah but
02:17:53.679 the problem is
02:17:54.478 the way it's being said she was talking
02:17:57.040 about how bad
02:17:58.000 trump handled the the rate of infection
02:18:00.879 first
02:18:01.200 of course and that's let's expand on
02:18:02.879 that i remember like interviewing lou
02:18:04.718 dobbs like 15 years ago
02:18:06.318 back when he was still on cnn we were
02:18:07.840 looking at documents
02:18:09.359 where it said we're going to bring in
02:18:11.519 global government the north american
02:18:13.040 union using
02:18:14.000 the threat of viruses migration flows
02:18:16.879 and economic collapse
02:18:18.318 and they said like a deadly flu or a
02:18:19.920 deadly sars yeah i'm sitting here
02:18:21.920 watching this power grab
02:18:23.760 watching the u.n and and and big tech
02:18:26.959 saying well you can't say
02:18:29.200 that that the un's wrong because the
02:18:30.959 un's in charge since when is the news
02:18:33.200 wh and all these doctors all these
02:18:35.679 medical doctors that come out and say
02:18:37.200 other things
02:18:38.080 other than them like how steroids cured
02:18:39.840 it or you know how hydroxychloroquine
02:18:42.000 helped it
02:18:42.558 how are they being banned even if they
02:18:44.638 were wrong
02:18:45.840 they should be have their license
02:18:47.280 removed that's what that's about it's
02:18:49.040 not
02:18:49.519 google decides that if something isn't
02:18:51.599 that you and it's taken down that's all
02:18:52.959 i'm saying
02:18:53.439 well it is a problem that they're
02:18:55.200 deciding which doctors to listen to and
02:18:57.519 which doctors not to
02:18:59.120 when there is some real controversy as
02:19:02.240 to how to
02:19:03.280 handle the virus virus with treatment
02:19:05.519 right what treatment
02:19:06.799 is effective and what isn't effective
02:19:08.638 now it turns out there's a lot of
02:19:10.080 doctors that think that
02:19:10.879 hydroxychloroquine
02:19:12.000 isn't effective there's a lot of there's
02:19:14.160 some doctors that thought it was and
02:19:15.760 they think that the
02:19:16.718 combination of zinc and hydro but the
02:19:19.200 ques the the problem is the people
02:19:21.439 that are deciding what gets taken down
02:19:24.160 or not getting that's a huge taken down
02:19:26.080 and the problem is that the doctors
02:19:27.439 would go well we think you know it's
02:19:28.959 like
02:19:29.519 there's we we've minimized the voices of
02:19:32.318 the people that
02:19:33.920 are saying one thing right and we've
02:19:35.599 elevated the voices of the people that
02:19:36.959 are saying another thing and it's like
02:19:38.638 that becomes the real issue whether
02:19:40.879 people like trump there's there's
02:19:42.318 stuff to criticize about trump we all
02:19:44.398 know that and there but in their defense
02:19:46.318 they're doing it because they think that
02:19:47.599 people are going to do something foolish
02:19:49.040 they're going to go out and spread the
02:19:49.920 virus further because it's not the
02:19:51.200 media's job
02:19:52.319 though to this is the problem i think
02:19:54.000 the media has taken on this really
02:19:55.680 activist role
02:19:56.880 where they are now there worse it's not
02:19:58.720 the meters social media
02:20:00.720 social media companies not not even
02:20:02.880 necessarily the media
02:20:04.160 where you have like legitimate
02:20:05.359 journalists that are talking do you
02:20:07.280 think he would do something in a second
02:20:08.640 term about social media
02:20:09.920 i think he certainly is going to do
02:20:11.120 something why hasn't he done something
02:20:12.560 already
02:20:13.040 because it's so complex because they'll
02:20:14.720 claim it's election meddling even though
02:20:16.160 they're doing that at the same time
02:20:17.760 what we have is multinational
02:20:19.120 corporations acting in tandem
02:20:21.520 that are already making the nation state
02:20:23.040 obsolete they're creating a
02:20:24.960 information warfare monopoly and they're
02:20:28.240 censoring people and using that power
02:20:30.160 they have
02:20:30.960 and we just sit here denying it's going
02:20:32.880 on until it's too late
02:20:34.560 i mean it's it's it's a really serious
02:20:36.240 situation and it is crazy it is a crazy
02:20:38.720 situation where all of these tech
02:20:40.800 companies
02:20:41.520 all lean left all of them yeah they do
02:20:44.800 they lean left and they support like
02:20:46.399 there's there's no tech companies are
02:20:47.680 out there supporting donald trump
02:20:49.200 there's no tech companies what's very
02:20:50.479 interesting because tech companies are
02:20:51.840 very wealthy people right
02:20:53.120 they're insanely wealthy but david
02:20:54.720 pakman had a really good point about
02:20:55.920 that
02:20:56.399 that they like when it comes to their
02:20:58.080 financial dealings they
02:20:59.760 they're very conservative very
02:21:01.120 libertarian and conservative oh they
02:21:02.319 don't pay taxes
02:21:03.280 right i mean google pays almost taxes
02:21:05.200 what i'm telling you does apple complain
02:21:06.960 about chinese slave factories in china
02:21:09.120 no it's what i'm telling you is it's all
02:21:12.080 bs and when you study
02:21:13.680 what they're doing i can sit on my phone
02:21:15.600 and pull it up they talk about in
02:21:17.359 lockstep
02:21:18.560 bringing in a global authoritarian
02:21:21.200 system they talk about riots they talk
02:21:23.040 about war
02:21:23.920 if you can find that article there
02:21:25.439 aren't messages
02:21:27.280 i found something but i don't i'm trying
02:21:29.120 to understand what it's saying because
02:21:30.399 it's now it's
02:21:31.200 like it's speaking about years in the
02:21:32.560 future as though they've already
02:21:33.760 happened well we're not too far away
02:21:35.280 from let's see because like they're
02:21:37.040 painting another scenario just like they
02:21:38.720 painted
02:21:39.359 with that uh infection scenario
02:21:40.960 archive.org i found
02:21:42.560 i went to the second page of this link
02:21:44.160 but this is like scenario
02:21:45.760 narratives it says lockstep it talks
02:21:48.240 about uh pandemics from 2012 and the
02:21:50.560 sars and all sorts of
02:21:51.840 h1n1 so i skipped into the next page
02:21:54.640 just to
02:21:55.439 while you guys were talking and this is
02:21:57.280 the part that that's a little strange
02:21:58.720 which
02:21:59.040 is getting into what i think he is now
02:22:00.640 where is that can you highlight um
02:22:03.359 it started here because it says about
02:22:04.720 kenya in 2025 and people being weary of
02:22:07.120 top down okay
02:22:08.160 by 2025 people seem to be growing weary
02:22:10.720 of so much top down control and letting
02:22:12.880 leaders and
02:22:14.080 authorities make choices for them
02:22:17.760 whatever net wherever national interest
02:22:20.160 clashed with individual interests
02:22:22.000 there was conflict sporadic pushback
02:22:24.319 becomes increasingly organized and
02:22:26.319 coordinated
02:22:27.200 as disaffected youth and people who have
02:22:29.200 seen their status and opportunities slip
02:22:31.120 away
02:22:31.760 largely in developing countries and
02:22:34.000 cited civil unrest
02:22:35.600 by 2026 protesters in nigeria brought
02:22:39.120 down the government
02:22:40.319 fed up with the entrenched cronyism and
02:22:42.880 corruption
02:22:43.760 even those who'd like the greater
02:22:45.280 stability and predictability
02:22:47.040 of this world began to grow
02:22:48.560 uncomfortable and constrained by so many
02:22:51.120 tight rules
02:22:52.080 and by the strictness of national
02:22:53.840 boundaries the feeling lingered
02:22:56.240 that sooner or later something would
02:22:58.000 have inevitably upset
02:22:59.359 the neat order that the world's
02:23:01.280 governments had worked so hard to
02:23:02.880 establish
02:23:03.680 okay i never read that but that's the
02:23:05.359 other stuff it's in there i'm telling
02:23:06.800 thousands of pages man okay it talks
02:23:08.800 about global police state and
02:23:10.319 worldwide riots and i mean we're not
02:23:12.000 that far away there's people are saying
02:23:13.840 they're writing that yeah they're
02:23:14.960 they're writing it almost like i've
02:23:23.120 like the eu right it's a supernational
02:23:25.520 financial architecture
02:23:27.280 people are saying that borders are
02:23:28.720 racist people are saying that the idea
02:23:30.319 of america is races their countries
02:23:32.319 you know israel the idea of a country or
02:23:34.319 nation state is racist there is this
02:23:36.240 growing
02:23:37.200 uh idea or ideology that
02:23:40.399 global governance is a good thing or
02:23:42.080 that nation states are
02:23:44.000 you know well it comes down to this it's
02:23:46.319 not that nation of states are perfect
02:23:47.760 multinational corporations
02:23:49.280 are bigger and operate in many cases
02:23:51.439 more powerfully than governments
02:23:52.800 correct and so they want control and
02:23:54.720 they say they want control
02:23:56.000 and they're going to use racial
02:23:57.040 differences between two countries to
02:23:58.720 play them off against each other and
02:23:59.920 they're going to use
02:24:01.120 global crises to centralize global
02:24:03.200 control and that's what they say in
02:24:04.640 these white papers is
02:24:05.840 the corporations are using this for
02:24:07.439 global control and there will be
02:24:09.280 rebellions against it that's what i read
02:24:11.040 and then people
02:24:12.479 more loyalty to multinational
02:24:14.319 corporations and more loyalty
02:24:16.080 they have more in common with people
02:24:17.359 that live in london or davos or switzer
02:24:19.840 than they do to their american citizens
02:24:22.880 and that
02:24:23.359 that becomes the problem you've got
02:24:24.880 google and facebook executives on jumbo
02:24:27.200 jets and mansions
02:24:28.479 telling us we've got to lower our carbon
02:24:30.080 footprint and be poor they're hypocrites
02:24:32.160 it doesn't hold water
02:24:33.520 yeah how do we get out of it there it is
02:24:36.399 authoritarian capitalism
02:24:38.560 i mean i remember i i don't have it in
02:24:40.399 front of me but i was reading the
02:24:42.160 lockstep rockefeller documents and they
02:24:43.760 predicted worldwide police state
02:24:45.920 uh authoritarianism civil war i mean
02:24:48.479 they're predicting in 2018
02:24:50.640 says will africa embrace were africa's
02:24:53.920 embrace of authoritarian capitalism a la
02:24:56.960 china continue and then vietnam
02:25:00.160 to require a solar panel at every home
02:25:02.160 in 2022
02:25:03.680 and then in 2025 that's not the same
02:25:05.359 documents i saw but
02:25:06.800 that's the question is it's weird the
02:25:08.640 way they're writing this
02:25:10.160 they're they're writing this as this
02:25:11.520 they're they're predicting already
02:25:12.800 happening
02:25:13.439 yeah well they're they're talking about
02:25:15.439 it like they're they're seeing the
02:25:16.640 future and
02:25:17.280 like almost like it's fiction but
02:25:18.560 they're talking about it like here's
02:25:19.760 trump saying
02:25:20.960 we're not gonna control the pandemic you
02:25:23.280 don't you get used to it you get over it
02:25:26.000 you fight it with nutraceuticals you
02:25:27.680 fight it with you know with with
02:25:29.439 therapeutics it's
02:25:30.319 the idea that bill gates came out two
02:25:32.319 weeks ago and he goes we'll be shut down
02:25:34.000 for 10 years
02:25:34.720 is that what he said he said yeah he
02:25:36.479 said this goes on for 10 years
02:25:38.000 until there's not one corona case well
02:25:40.240 they pick the perfect
02:25:41.439 the perfect problem they can never do it
02:25:43.520 isn't that crazy like
02:25:44.640 you see a guy like jamie who literally
02:25:46.319 kicked it in a day and they're saying
02:25:48.080 we're going to close down
02:25:49.040 the world for 10 days well it's also
02:25:50.640 like the war on terror is still going on
02:25:52.800 i mean yeah they want to
02:25:53.760 exactly they want a problem that never
02:25:55.280 goes away yeah it's never gonna i mean
02:25:56.479 the cold war went on forever i mean this
02:25:58.000 is just
02:25:58.640 they like these things but we've entered
02:26:00.720 into three hours in here two and a half
02:26:02.319 hours in here we've entered into this
02:26:04.000 weird spot we're like okay what could be
02:26:07.200 where you're going to drink whiskey yeah
02:26:09.680 i don't know i've already been about at
02:26:10.800 election night i'm here
02:26:11.920 what could be done um what can be done
02:26:16.080 man all i know is i try to tell the
02:26:17.680 truth i make mistakes but i'm sitting
02:26:19.600 here
02:26:20.399 with these notes i've written where i
02:26:22.160 read what globalists say
02:26:23.600 i gave you that wall street journal
02:26:24.800 article where they go we're in we're
02:26:26.640 impure that we can get sick
02:26:28.640 it's time to get rid of all humans and
02:26:30.240 merge with machines it's so beautiful i
02:26:32.479 think well that's just one kook
02:26:33.840 and then it's almost all these people
02:26:35.760 and really they're trying to convince
02:26:37.040 the public to all roll over and die
02:26:38.880 but wait a minute isn't that a
02:26:40.560 provocative article
02:26:41.920 by a journalist who's trying to paint a
02:26:44.720 rosy picture of our
02:26:46.240 symbiotic relationship with technology i
02:26:48.479 mean when someone's saying
02:26:49.760 like i mean literally saying looking
02:26:52.240 forward to the end of humanity that's
02:26:53.840 it's a provocative article it's like but
02:26:55.600 that's the nihilistic attitude these
02:26:57.600 people actually pick up i mean yes it is
02:26:59.520 but it's also sort of this inevitable if
02:27:01.760 you
02:27:02.080 extrapolate from where we are now with
02:27:04.319 technology to where we're going to be in
02:27:05.920 20 30 years
02:27:06.960 and when you look at things like neural
02:27:08.399 link and you look at a lot of this uh
02:27:10.399 technology that they're they're coming
02:27:12.720 up with but we're talking about big tech
02:27:14.560 censoring us i don't want them plugged
02:27:16.240 into my goddamn brain yeah
02:27:17.920 it's probably a bad idea it seems like a
02:27:19.840 bad idea to have them invade your body
02:27:22.000 well when you're talking about
02:27:23.359 centralized power like that
02:27:24.960 it is not a good idea it's a bad idea to
02:27:27.359 give them all i'm saying is
02:27:28.720 joe and i'm glad you're here i'm glad
02:27:30.160 you're here i'm very excited to be here
02:27:32.160 tonight and i really appreciate you
02:27:33.520 we have to get people to debate the fact
02:27:36.319 that there's people
02:27:37.200 engineers and technocrats choosing their
02:27:40.000 course
02:27:40.720 and that the public is not involved in
02:27:42.800 deciding that course
02:27:44.080 i hope people are starting to understand
02:27:46.720 when you see the white house press
02:27:47.840 secretary
02:27:48.880 get banned from twitter when you see the
02:27:50.800 new york post links get banned from
02:27:52.399 twitter
02:27:53.040 i hope people are starting to understand
02:27:54.640 that giving people power giving large
02:27:57.439 groups power
02:27:58.479 over whether it's national discourse
02:28:00.560 whether it's policy any of these
02:28:02.399 these things yeah it's bad it's a bad
02:28:04.880 idea it's a bad idea
02:28:05.920 exactly you don't want to do it the
02:28:08.640 founding fathers although they didn't
02:28:10.319 predict
02:28:11.359 technology they didn't predict the
02:28:12.800 internet they did predict what happens
02:28:15.120 when you give human beings ultimate
02:28:16.880 power
02:28:17.359 right i mean power corrupts absolute
02:28:19.439 power crops absolutely yeah
02:28:20.720 so joe you just said it so let me ask
02:28:22.640 this question
02:28:24.960 because see this you got a huge audience
02:28:27.040 we could really change the world right
02:28:28.080 now i think we've done a good no one's
02:28:29.359 listening
02:28:30.240 no they're listening there's no one if
02:28:31.680 you want to change the world you go on
02:28:32.800 alyssa milano's show
02:28:33.920 that's the show dude no no i only get
02:28:36.800 three times as many listeners

02:28:45.120 me tell you that i don't think zombies
02:28:46.319 did you guys hear what i said
02:28:48.960 listen you can look at tony podesta or
02:28:51.439 john podesta and laugh at them they run
02:28:53.280 the democratic party
02:28:54.880 it came out two months ago in the new
02:28:56.160 york times bragging that they were in
02:28:58.000 the meeting
02:28:58.720 when they were wargaming on thousands of
02:29:00.560 people listening on a telephone call
02:29:02.399 they go we're not gonna concede and
02:29:05.120 we're gonna
02:29:05.920 have the country break up and we're
02:29:09.280 going to have secession
02:29:10.960 and we're going to call for the u.n to
02:29:12.399 invade america how [ __ ] up would it be
02:29:14.640 if you
02:29:15.359 like all this stuff actually comes
02:29:16.880 through the way this happens this will
02:29:18.479 be [ __ ] insane
02:29:19.600 is it good but when people are talking
02:29:22.800 about
02:29:23.200 be careful with that that camera don't
02:29:24.960 bump that camera but i'm not
02:29:26.479 saying it's going to happen i'm saying
02:29:28.160 they're saying it because if it doesn't
02:29:29.680 happen i'll be glad
02:29:30.640 but they're like oh you know jones is
02:29:32.000 saying this is happening no i know you
02:29:33.600 will be grabbed
02:29:34.479 they're literally this
02:29:37.600 like this podcast can be heavily
02:29:39.040 criticized right we are aware of this
02:29:40.960 but when we knew that coming in but when
02:29:44.160 this goes down if this goes down the way
02:29:46.160 you're describing it
02:29:47.359 how eerie would this be well i don't i
02:29:50.160 it would be very
02:29:51.359 eerie it would be very scary because
02:29:52.720 somebody will tell you like this is what
02:29:54.720 they're saying they're going to do
02:29:55.760 now i hope they don't do it but they are
02:29:58.479 saying
02:29:59.520 that they're going to contest the
02:30:00.720 election when they lose and if trump
02:30:02.960 tries to declare it
02:30:04.720 big tech has implemented this ai system
02:30:06.960 that's going to block
02:30:07.840 hundreds of millions of americans from
02:30:10.080 being able to say
02:30:12.160 trump won election night yeah and so
02:30:14.000 that's why election night is so
02:30:15.280 spectacular and some people can say well
02:30:16.880 there's never been voter fraud before or
02:30:18.399 voter fraud has been so minuscule in the
02:30:20.000 past
02:30:20.880 that is true but however the ability to
02:30:24.000 vote by mail
02:30:25.120 in advance never really existed like it
02:30:27.040 existed exactly and 80 million ballots
02:30:29.200 put out there
02:30:30.160 80 million ballots put out there's a
02:30:31.520 total wild card so who is counting all
02:30:33.920 these ballots
02:30:35.840 it's the locals it's whoever grabs them
02:30:37.840 it's whoever puts in the false names
02:30:39.359 there's been a bunch of people arrested
02:30:41.120 right but if you're say if you're in a
02:30:42.720 democratically controlled state
02:30:44.640 and you so who is controlling and
02:30:47.840 counting
02:30:48.319 those those ballots
02:30:51.520 brian redman he's a good guy he'll tell
02:30:54.560 us the truth
02:30:56.080 brian get over here real quick he's
02:30:58.960 going for two minutes
02:31:00.399 okay we need brian no
02:31:03.520 i mean seriously i don't know what's
02:31:05.680 going to happen joe
02:31:06.800 i know the democrat chief strategist
02:31:09.040 says we're going to contest the election
02:31:11.359 we're going to break the country up like
02:31:13.359 civil war 1862
02:31:15.520 and we're going to do all this and we're
02:31:17.280 going to say that go ahead they found
02:31:18.960 water on the moon
02:31:20.560 awesome
02:31:25.200 they did find waterloo you know six
02:31:28.000 months before they said that
02:31:29.200 buzz aldrin called me up and he said
02:31:30.960 there's water in the moon and he goes we
02:31:32.240 they're going to crash an end in probe
02:31:33.600 and there it's like not you know 2007 or
02:31:36.479 something
02:31:37.040 they're going to crash an indian probe
02:31:38.399 on the moon i want you to know we
02:31:40.000 already crashed while they're going to
02:31:40.960 find the water i was like thank you buzz
02:31:42.880 aldrin
02:31:43.840 so he called you up yep does buzz call
02:31:47.040 you often
02:31:48.319 no he's called me like three times are
02:31:50.080 you ever shocked are you like
02:31:51.520 he's like it's alex's puzzle he actually
02:31:54.080 got like 20 million views before they
02:31:55.600 took it off youtube
02:31:56.640 he was on the show one time and he goes
02:31:58.479 my secretary really likes you
02:32:00.319 on here he goes is she a hottie you're
02:32:01.840 lucky i'm doing this i'm like
02:32:03.359 well yes sir he goes there is the moon
02:32:06.319 of
02:32:07.520 mars that is where the real obelisk here
02:32:09.600 is 2001
02:32:10.960 and the aliens created the pyramids and
02:32:13.439 i just wanted to tell you alex you gotta
02:32:15.200 what
02:32:16.399 he said the aliens created the pyramids
02:32:18.640 yeah and there was an obelisk
02:32:21.359 that's not as shocking the the buzz buzz
02:32:23.680 aldrin said the aliens created the
02:32:25.200 pyramids
02:32:26.240 yeah i'm telling you i was contacted by
02:32:28.560 buzz aldrin's secretary
02:32:31.120 and i'm not picking this up this is real
02:32:33.359 i don't believe you are
02:32:34.319 and and it's just like whatever this was
02:32:36.160 like 12 years ago whatever 10 years ago
02:32:38.080 whatever it was
02:32:39.359 like hey buzz aldrin wants to come on so
02:32:41.040 we checked his buzz aldrin he wants to
02:32:42.560 talk about his new book
02:32:44.640 and once he gets on he goes it is the
02:32:47.359 soul moon
02:32:48.399 choron or whatever it's called look up
02:32:50.160 the moon of moon of
02:32:52.000 i'm off memory of somebody get this
02:32:53.359 stuff wrong of mars he goes that is
02:32:55.680 where the true obelisk is and that will
02:32:57.359 give us the data tapes to
02:32:59.040 go the next level and and i just wanted
02:33:01.280 you to know that because you're a good
02:33:02.399 person that
02:33:03.359 the pyramids were created by aliens and
02:33:05.280 we're doing important work there he is
02:33:06.880 buzz aldrin admits aliens built the
02:33:08.640 pyramids
02:33:09.280 and the phobos monument oh the the uh
02:33:12.560 he said after he talked to me on c-span
02:33:14.240 yeah and so
02:33:16.720 he said aliens built the pyramids i
02:33:19.680 swear
02:33:20.000 to god this guy really went off to
02:33:21.280 reservation like you think nasa is like
02:33:23.280 doing a better vetting process now
02:33:24.880 because this guy really well you know
02:33:26.399 he's had tough times
02:33:27.439 well he just endorsed trump oh did he
02:33:30.720 why did he endorse trump all the
02:33:32.160 military endorsed trump all the police
02:33:34.560 but listen i'm not bragging i don't know
02:33:36.880 why
02:33:37.680 i thought he had him on about a book he
02:33:39.120 wrote he starts telling me about aliens
02:33:41.200 the pyramids and the french let me ask
02:33:42.880 you this what did you think about the
02:33:44.080 pentagon saying recently that they've
02:33:45.680 recovered crafts that are not of this
02:33:47.280 world
02:33:48.560 i think it's probably true i think it's
02:33:50.720 probably true as well i think we're like
02:33:52.080 to ditch
02:33:52.800 like a movie theater but i talked to uh
02:33:55.120 stuff of the ditch like
02:33:56.240 yeah when i talked to commander fravor
02:33:58.560 um who is the guy who saw that uh the
02:34:00.720 tic tac
02:34:01.600 ufo off the coast of san diego the way
02:34:03.680 he describes it and the the video
02:34:05.280 footage that they got of this thing
02:34:07.040 and his his take on it is [ __ ]
02:34:09.920 chilling
02:34:10.479 yeah that thing went from 60 000 feet
02:34:12.640 above tic tac
02:34:14.080 okay yeah it looks like a tic-tac-toe
02:34:16.240 new code name it's tic-tac-toe
02:34:19.280 no no yeah it's a huge problem no it's
02:34:22.080 just a little tic-tac-toe
02:34:24.399 what do you say about it he said that
02:34:25.840 this thing went from 60 000 feet above
02:34:28.319 sea level to one inside of a second
02:34:31.200 he said it defied propulsion
02:34:34.640 by any but any understanding that we
02:34:36.319 have of physics the way it moved
02:34:38.720 was insane it was actively blocking
02:34:41.359 tracking systems
02:34:42.399 which is an act of war they do they
02:34:44.560 block all the radars
02:34:45.840 you could listen to him on my podcast
02:34:47.359 but i would actually recommend you
02:34:48.479 listen to him
02:34:49.200 on lex friedman's podcast it's available
02:34:51.359 on youtube and lex does an amazing job
02:34:53.680 of of
02:34:54.319 talking to him and breaking down let's
02:34:56.399 do that what do you think the universe
02:34:58.640 is what do you think
02:34:59.680 let's talk real what's the secret
02:35:01.359 universe totally legit report says buzz
02:35:03.600 aldrin saw aliens when he was up in
02:35:05.439 space
02:35:05.920 sarcasm oh well that's not joe is that
02:35:09.280 you in the photo they said that he tried
02:35:12.080 they reached out to his people and they
02:35:13.280 said that this bogus and we don't know
02:35:14.640 where it came from
02:35:15.760 it's bogus we don't know where well he
02:35:17.120 came on my show and said that
02:35:19.120 the pyramid thing the pyramid quote and
02:35:21.120 said it's bogus yeah well maybe they
02:35:22.800 pulled them aside but joe let's get
02:35:24.080 let's have fun here
02:35:25.200 everybody's watching it's an epic
02:35:26.560 podcast part three joe rogan
02:35:29.520 i want to know so what is what what do
02:35:31.439 you think runs the universe what do you
02:35:32.640 think the secret is who are the dmt
02:35:34.080 elves
02:35:34.640 when's the last time you took dmt it's
02:35:36.399 been a couple years um
02:35:38.080 i don't think that there is
02:35:41.280 any doubt that there's other life out
02:35:43.439 there it's a matter of uh
02:35:45.359 if it contacts us regularly whether or
02:35:47.760 not it's contacted us or why it comes
02:35:49.760 and why it visits or
02:35:51.439 uh jacques valet i believe i think his
02:35:55.439 perception is not that they're from
02:35:58.080 another planet but that
02:36:00.399 that would be probably the least
02:36:02.560 spectacular answer
02:36:04.080 and that they could be interdimensional
02:36:05.760 travelers some people believe that their
02:36:07.840 time
02:36:08.399 jack valet is the guy who uh steven
02:36:10.319 spielsberg
02:36:11.439 he modeled that french scientist in
02:36:13.600 close encounters with the third kind
02:36:15.120 after him he's a really really
02:36:17.040 interesting guy and that's what i
02:36:18.399 personally believe is
02:36:19.439 interdimensional it could be that it
02:36:21.600 could be that
02:36:23.359 our understanding of reality itself is
02:36:26.800 very limited it's like
02:36:28.319 you know if you wave your hand above
02:36:30.960 certain insects they have no idea you're
02:36:32.640 even there right
02:36:33.600 they lack the ability to detect it that
02:36:35.680 we we have senses that we assume
02:36:38.319 are the only senses that are available
02:36:40.560 and it is entirely
02:36:42.880 likely that there are many dimensions
02:36:46.160 that we don't have access to
02:36:47.680 right and this is the quantum physicists
02:36:49.840 and all those guys that write the [ __ ]
02:36:51.520 on yellow
02:36:52.240 legal pads that you don't understand
02:36:53.920 they they all believe there's
02:36:55.439 many many dimensions out there there's
02:36:56.800 no jobs i agree with you i agree with
02:36:59.600 you
02:37:00.000 i think the universe is insanely huge
02:37:03.760 and they're finding life compatible
02:37:06.479 planets
02:37:07.120 on a daily basis there's hundreds of
02:37:09.600 them now so i agree with you let me ask
02:37:10.960 this question then what do we do about
02:37:12.640 this corrupt political elite
02:37:14.479 trying to make us look at them we'll
02:37:16.160 follow them how do we break free of them
02:37:18.319 well that's a different thing of the
02:37:19.760 universe but my question is like why are
02:37:21.520 they telling us
02:37:22.399 now that they've acquired these ships or
02:37:25.040 that they they
02:37:25.840 they have access to these things or that
02:37:27.600 they know these things are real
02:37:29.040 you know um bob lazar has basically been
02:37:31.680 describing exactly that
02:37:33.600 in exactly the same way since 1989
02:37:36.800 when uh when he was uh
02:37:39.920 first hiding uh when he was on uh
02:37:43.600 george knapp's television show in vegas
02:37:45.600 and they had him out only as a
02:37:46.960 silhouette
02:37:47.760 and then he eventually came out and said
02:37:49.040 that he was a propulsion expert that was
02:37:50.960 brought to area s4
02:37:52.399 and they've tried to discredit him and
02:37:54.479 they've tried to talk but
02:37:56.000 one of the things that he said was he
02:37:57.280 talked about element 115
02:37:59.040 and that this was something that they
02:38:00.399 used to propel these crafts and it was
02:38:02.080 something that
02:38:02.960 it can it could change gravity can bend
02:38:05.680 gravity and propel itself
02:38:07.920 in a way that is not like any propulsion
02:38:09.920 system that we use now which essentially
02:38:12.080 you have to push something out the back
02:38:13.600 to make it go forward whether it's
02:38:14.880 flames or
02:38:15.840 you know a rocket or anything else like
02:38:18.640 even a an airplane right
02:38:20.479 it propels things forward and what he
02:38:22.399 was saying is that
02:38:23.600 what this element 115 is allowing them
02:38:25.920 to do is to somehow or another
02:38:28.000 bend space and time some another bend
02:38:30.720 gravity
02:38:32.000 but they don't know how it works they
02:38:34.160 don't know
02:38:35.040 what what it's doing let's talk about
02:38:36.640 this operates on this element
02:38:38.160 let's talk about this hold on they know
02:38:39.680 it operates on this element it was only
02:38:41.200 theoretical until
02:38:42.479 i think it was 2013 or 2015
02:38:46.080 they used a particle collider and they
02:38:48.399 they they
02:38:49.359 detected it in an actual element 115
02:38:52.560 that it was actually real and that's
02:38:53.840 what the superconducting super colliders
02:38:55.359 are for
02:38:56.000 well i mean they're they're for
02:38:57.600 detecting many things
02:38:59.840 well these particle colliders are for
02:39:01.840 detecting many different things that are
02:39:03.680 theoretical
02:39:04.399 and they they find these things to be
02:39:05.840 true and then it becomes you know
02:39:07.920 a scientific record what i think is that
02:39:11.520 we are apes we are these weird
02:39:14.720 talking apes that are at an adolescent
02:39:17.120 stage of technological evolution
02:39:19.520 and what we might be looking at when we
02:39:21.760 see these these
02:39:22.880 uh tic tac ufos and other things we
02:39:25.680 might be looking at something from the
02:39:26.800 future
02:39:27.439 we might be looking at time travelers we
02:39:29.120 might might be looking at something that
02:39:30.479 comes back
02:39:31.200 and you know i think that's i think
02:39:32.479 that's a good approximation but
02:39:34.560 we're a little bit beyond just apes
02:39:36.399 clearly we're from outside the planet
02:39:38.640 and there's something bigger going on
02:39:40.319 like this this life forms happened
02:39:41.840 before
02:39:42.479 this is a major test and so we can sit
02:39:44.960 there and just say oh we're just apes
02:39:46.640 no i don't mean that what i mean by
02:39:48.160 we're just apes is that in comparison to
02:39:50.399 what we could be eventually through
02:39:51.920 evolution
02:39:52.560 you're saying metamorphosis yeah we're
02:39:55.120 we're on a
02:39:56.319 look we're a lot smarter than apes right
02:39:58.479 than regular apes that are in most of us
02:40:00.479 in in the zoo yeah or in well some of
02:40:02.560 them's dumber than that yeah right yeah
02:40:04.080 i was about to say
02:40:04.880 some of them are dumber paint with a
02:40:06.080 broad brush but we are nowhere near
02:40:08.240 where our potential lies right right our
02:40:09.920 potential lies far far
02:40:11.359 far in advance of what we are currently
02:40:13.120 and i think some of this has to do
02:40:15.040 with some of these uh symbiotic
02:40:16.800 technologies that we're talking about
02:40:18.000 like neurolink and a lot of these things
02:40:19.760 that are are being proposed that are
02:40:21.760 eventually going to
02:40:23.359 find their way into the human body and
02:40:25.359 accelerate but
02:40:26.640 are they going to lower our ability are
02:40:28.479 they going to censor our ability
02:40:30.880 well because we're already growing and
02:40:32.960 all i see from big tech is censorship so
02:40:34.880 is the neural link
02:40:36.080 gonna censor what i do well the little
02:40:37.920 plug-in and make me feel great and
02:40:39.600 hit my pleasure center when you're
02:40:41.120 talking about human emotions
02:40:42.880 and greed and power and all these
02:40:44.800 different things these are all
02:40:46.840 biological issues that we have that the
02:40:49.760 idea is
02:40:50.960 will be transcended if you could somehow
02:40:53.760 if you believe the big tech lords aren't
02:40:55.680 like us
02:40:56.319 they're they're us though so they're in
02:40:58.560 charge of the same thing that we already
02:41:00.160 are
02:41:00.479 so to say oh big tech lords are going to
02:41:02.720 take us away from our human problems
02:41:04.399 right but do you want to transcend sin
02:41:06.000 they're going to make it worse okay but
02:41:07.279 do you understand that they didn't
02:41:08.960 understand what technology was going to
02:41:10.880 create when it created the internet
02:41:12.479 the the ability to totally establish
02:41:16.000 the ability to distribute information
02:41:17.520 that existed pre-1990 whatever when the
02:41:20.399 internet became
02:41:21.439 mainstream it was very very very
02:41:24.080 different than it is today and it's very
02:41:25.760 hard to get away with the things you get
02:41:27.120 away with in the early
02:41:28.720 1980s what they wait what they can do
02:41:31.120 now in terms of a regular person
02:41:33.120 and their ability to transmit
02:41:34.720 information to access information
02:41:36.640 it's all what i'm saying is
02:41:40.080 giant leaps i get it the technology's
02:41:42.479 there i'm not against the technology
02:41:44.319 it's those that introduce it to us and
02:41:46.479 then control how it's deployed
02:41:48.160 i understand that's a big issue but
02:41:49.760 everything is about what i was trying to
02:41:51.279 get to is
02:41:52.399 the way information has gotten out of
02:41:54.479 their hands and you can distribute it in
02:41:56.160 a way that they never anticipated
02:41:57.680 if they did anticipate it i guarantee
02:41:59.359 they would have never left the internet
02:42:00.399 i agree i used to
02:42:01.359 i think that same thing is going to
02:42:03.439 happen with all other technologies
02:42:05.520 and if that's the case technology may be
02:42:07.840 our only hope
02:42:09.040 technology may be the only thing that
02:42:10.800 saves us from
02:42:12.080 all these human emotions the the need
02:42:14.080 for power and greed
02:42:15.520 and control the the one thing that might
02:42:18.000 save us
02:42:18.720 from that is this symbiotic relationship
02:42:21.200 with technology
02:42:22.160 where we connect to things that will
02:42:24.479 alleviate a lot of the
02:42:26.000 problems that you know if that
02:42:27.600 technology i don't i'm not saying this
02:42:28.960 is good or bad
02:42:29.760 or wrong can i say something yeah you're
02:42:31.920 doing really good this is
02:42:32.960 great rants best joe rogan i've ever
02:42:34.960 seen i'm not being patronizing it's good
02:42:36.880 stuff it's okay you're drunk
02:42:38.240 no no i'm saying this is powerful be
02:42:41.120 nice
02:42:42.479 be nice what i'm saying is
02:42:45.920 there's outside groups trying to program
02:42:48.000 that so you can't project your own
02:42:50.080 goodness
02:42:51.120 onto this not saying even goodness i'm
02:42:53.359 saying no i'm what i'm saying is you've
02:42:55.520 been
02:42:55.840 ranting for five minutes and i'm i'm
02:42:57.600 just what do you just say
02:42:59.359 i get what you're saying it's just that
02:43:02.960 you're sitting there saying this will
02:43:04.720 free us from our problems
02:43:07.359 but it's still humans that program the
02:43:09.200 nexus points of it
02:43:10.399 so it could actually amplify the
02:43:12.399 problems i'm saying we should be wary of
02:43:13.840 all
02:43:14.080 oh it certainly could look it could go
02:43:16.479 sideways it could all go bad
02:43:18.479 but it also could go to a point where
02:43:20.560 people don't feel the need to do that
02:43:22.720 anymore
02:43:23.520 and that we recognize that a lot of what
02:43:25.680 we have is
02:43:26.720 we we are escaping the shackles of our
02:43:28.800 monkey bodies
02:43:30.319 our monkey bodies yeah so if we're
02:43:32.319 silicon
02:43:33.680 and have don't need resources anymore we
02:43:35.439 can just be spiritual
02:43:37.120 and then we'll be able to free ourselves
02:43:38.640 and not hurt the earth anymore hop in
02:43:40.080 that tic tac
02:43:40.880 and fly to alpha centauri in the blink
02:43:42.880 of an eye so we need to we need to uh
02:43:44.720 no i already see the transmission if you
02:43:46.800 could have a spaceship that would allow
02:43:48.880 you
02:43:49.200 to go anywhere in the galaxy would you
02:43:52.000 be willing to give
02:43:53.200 up any of your emotions for that no i
02:43:56.399 know that i know that i know the digital
02:43:57.920 deal
02:43:58.640 give up your body for the silicon gods
02:44:01.200 and become a god
02:44:02.160 this is all fun and games but like we're
02:44:04.000 not even i mean california we're not
02:44:05.279 even allowed to go to applebee's so
02:44:06.640 let's stop with the spaceship
02:44:08.960 let's just try to get i'm not allowed to
02:44:11.040 leave my phone i want to go to the
02:44:12.240 comedy store
02:44:13.040 yeah i mean we'll get a spaceship
02:44:15.120 eventually let's get a few
02:44:17.120 got your thing i'm coming to your
02:44:18.319 election night you're drowning with me
02:44:21.200 election night elections 25 billion
02:44:25.279 listen you invited yourself to this i
02:44:26.800 think you should settle down aliens
02:44:29.040 you told me already no you invited
02:44:30.960 yourself we already got it
02:44:32.479 coming no i said you could come in for a
02:44:34.160 little bit but you're you're making it
02:44:35.680 the alex jones show
02:44:36.800 no i'm not it's a bit of an issue this
02:44:38.479 is like the elections there's an issue
02:44:40.080 applejack of an issue settle down it's a
02:44:42.160 bit of an issue it's gonna be a fun uh
02:44:43.680 fun experience it'll be a lot of fun
02:44:45.439 but what being so mean you you literally
02:44:49.359 might be me no i think joe wants to beat
02:44:52.000 my ass friend no i don't listen alex i
02:44:53.840 love you
02:44:54.240 but what i'm saying and i'm not even
02:44:55.680 disagreeing with you i'm saying that
02:44:57.920 i think when you were talking about
02:44:59.920 aliens and we're talking about life
02:45:01.840 forms from out of space and space travel
02:45:03.840 and [ __ ]
02:45:04.240 the biggest big issues of the election
02:45:05.920 well you see those [ __ ] things like
02:45:07.680 the
02:45:08.399 ceremonies they all have big heads yeah
02:45:10.560 they're crazy little
02:45:12.000 tiny muscleless bodies heads shaved
02:45:14.399 heads yeah they're
02:45:15.279 kidding like they escaped they've
02:45:17.040 escaped all of the you're actually an
02:45:18.960 alien
02:45:20.080 they look like what we're gonna be yeah
02:45:21.760 but who wants to be that
02:45:23.279 i don't want to be that right i mean
02:45:24.319 that's what i'm saying no i'm with you i
02:45:26.000 like being a person
02:45:26.880 right i think we should be humans for as
02:45:28.240 long as we can what do you think aliens
02:45:30.560 are
02:45:34.560 there are all sorts of interdimensional
02:45:36.560 forces in the universe in
02:45:37.840 multi-dimension so there's like bad
02:45:39.520 aliens that are trying to
02:45:41.040 manipulate our development gretchen
02:45:43.680 because a high level
02:45:44.960 exactly a high level would not try to
02:45:47.359 manipulate our development
02:45:49.680 right okay so so joe is like imprinting
02:45:52.720 on these demons because he loves him
02:45:54.160 he's a bad person no no seriously
02:45:57.040 so all i'm saying is is we need to build
02:45:59.359 towards the next level
02:46:00.640 and do amazing things what do you think
02:46:02.160 of the what do you think and i did
02:46:03.520 invite myself
02:46:04.560 on the election show it's gonna be great
02:46:06.399 i got on my news in front of joe that's
02:46:08.319 correct i'll do it again right now but
02:46:09.520 what do you think
02:46:10.080 of my name stop making it about you no
02:46:12.080 it is about me i'm i'm front of goodness
02:46:14.160 you're drunk
02:46:14.720 i want to come on yes ban you from
02:46:16.640 alcohol what i want
02:46:18.160 you're going to smoke weed with me what
02:46:19.439 do you think about we're going to i will
02:46:20.880 definitely do that
02:46:22.560 what do you think the highest rate of
02:46:23.760 everyday what do you think about the
02:46:24.960 theory that human beings are the product
02:46:26.960 of accelerated evolution that they came
02:46:28.880 down here and they genetically
02:46:30.479 manipulated
02:46:31.439 lower hominids and they created human
02:46:33.200 beings listen i already have the genetic
02:46:35.359 memory i already told you all this
02:46:37.359 i mean already you have a genetic memory
02:46:39.760 yes that's epigenetics
02:46:42.800 yeah okay so i have a genetic you have a
02:46:45.680 genetic memory
02:46:46.560 right i have a genetic memory and i have
02:46:48.960 genetic memories that weren't you know i
02:46:50.399 have a bunch of memories
02:46:51.600 so you go watch star wars like i've done
02:46:53.120 this before this looks totally normal
02:46:55.120 we're in the universe we're in the
02:46:56.640 planets we're here our lives forms have
02:46:59.040 been all over the place like little
02:47:00.240 seeds that
02:47:01.120 jump from planet to planet like blowing
02:47:02.720 to the space winds so yeah we've already
02:47:04.720 been here before
02:47:05.600 because this is one of the things that
02:47:06.880 lazar brought up that they discussed
02:47:08.479 with him at area s4 they said that
02:47:10.560 they believed that human beings are the
02:47:12.319 product of accelerated evolution it's
02:47:14.000 like
02:47:14.479 and he wasn't sure if they were [ __ ]
02:47:15.760 with him like when he was reading all
02:47:17.359 that stuff he's like is this like
02:47:18.840 disinformation no they weren't [ __ ]
02:47:20.240 with them
02:47:21.120 yeah i mean but
02:47:25.120 god doesn't know where god came from
02:47:28.240 whoa and we said that last time that's
02:47:30.160 heavy and we don't know where we came
02:47:32.000 from right
02:47:32.800 but we have the archetypal memories that
02:47:35.200 go so far
02:47:36.800 and then our big fear is have an
02:47:38.319 evolutionary death of the species
02:47:40.720 it's like a line of you know flowers or
02:47:43.920 plants or you know whatever we are and
02:47:46.800 it's it's a whole
02:47:47.680 genetic experience we're conscious
02:47:50.080 individuals but then we have a genetic
02:47:51.520 experience
02:47:52.399 that goes on forever as long as the
02:47:54.880 light of the genetic experience doesn't
02:47:56.160 die
02:47:56.640 so we're always looking for eternal life
02:47:58.319 as long as we keep having kids they have
02:47:59.840 kids we live forever
02:48:00.960 that's us we just get better well as
02:48:03.920 long as the earth doesn't experience a
02:48:05.359 massive extinction event
02:48:06.720 but that's what i'm saying before you go
02:48:08.240 interplanetary that's well so the main
02:48:10.000 mission number third
02:48:11.840 79 days 79 days of chaos and i am
02:48:15.200 endorsing joe biden right now
02:48:18.319 i'm voting for by the way that might be
02:48:19.920 a good strategy if you endorse joe biden
02:48:21.920 right now
02:48:22.399 i'm going to go with my history of
02:48:24.000 voting for people that have been on the
02:48:25.040 podcast so i'm going to vote for kanye
02:48:26.720 i'm going with joe jorgensen because i
02:48:28.479 like to back a winner am i sitting in
02:48:29.920 the same seat as kanye yes you are
02:48:31.920 all right i'm fulfilled that's the best
02:48:34.319 all right but before this goes any
02:48:35.439 further off the rails i think we're good
02:48:37.439 we've done it oh you want to end this
02:48:38.720 transmission do you i never got to all

02:52:27.680 really want to discuss
02:52:29.200 no i mean i'm glad that jamie is better
02:52:31.520 than i am but search the internet i'm
02:52:32.800 not kissing his ass but
02:52:33.840 i'm really good at it he's better than i
02:52:36.080 am which is almost no one knows
02:52:38.160 he does it with one hand the problem is
02:52:39.600 i remember all this stuff now most of
02:52:41.680 the time it's accurate sometimes it's
02:52:43.040 not
02:52:43.520 but i mean if i'm saying something i
02:52:44.800 believe i saw it or i did it one thing
02:52:46.479 that was in there
02:52:47.279 i didn't want to correct earlier but uh
02:52:49.920 the year you were talking about
02:52:51.200 something
02:52:51.760 you kept saying 1963 and then they went
02:52:53.840 to like 82 or whatever that happened
02:52:56.160 on 73. that the group wasn't even around
02:52:59.200 yet the
02:52:59.840 the something to roam clubber room yeah
02:53:02.240 that was that wasn't even created so 68
02:53:04.560 so just for clarification purposes okay
02:53:07.120 cool
02:53:07.600 i think they had a subgroup earlier than
02:53:09.359 that
02:53:11.200 i'm not saying you're wrong yeah well
02:53:13.680 who knows but jamie's com i mean he has
02:53:15.279 george soros covent this is a
02:53:16.720 compromised individual might have
02:53:18.080 compromised the the records
02:53:21.040 oh that's another thing i want to say
02:53:22.240 can i say yeah
02:53:25.680 this is the most important thing we said
02:53:27.200 tonight we said a lot of important
02:53:28.880 things
02:53:30.640 but both of you are not drinking yes so
02:53:32.960 you don't know
02:53:33.760 right but this is it right now okay
02:53:37.439 mrna vaccines yeah so when you think
02:53:40.800 about a regular vaccine
02:53:42.720 goes in it's a broken bacteria a broken
02:53:46.000 virus it's defeated
02:53:47.359 your body learns how to kick its ass
02:53:49.120 it's like a dummy it's like
02:53:50.399 an attack dog training on a dummy right
02:53:52.720 the t lymphocyte
02:53:53.840 white blood cell it's like a big badass
02:53:55.920 mike tyson
02:53:56.880 it learns how to defeat it mrna vaccines
02:54:00.560 go
02:54:00.880 into your cells as a virus they're
02:54:03.279 viruses
02:54:04.399 so it's a virus they inject you with
02:54:06.640 that reprograms your cell
02:54:09.200 to then have a certain response to
02:54:11.200 things and release proteins
02:54:12.960 which is what cancer does and so they
02:54:15.439 admit on the news that 100 of people
02:54:17.279 that take these are getting sick
02:54:18.720 20 are going to um the hospital
02:54:22.080 and so they also have vaccines that are
02:54:24.319 called behavior modification vaccines
02:54:26.880 you can type it in okay but let me pause
02:54:28.640 right there
02:54:29.920 mrna vaccines you said 100 of them get
02:54:32.960 sick and 20 of them go to the hospital
02:54:36.560 they had two studies uh in one study 100
02:54:39.840 got sick 20 with the hospital another
02:54:41.680 study 80 percent got sick and of those
02:54:43.600 20 percent went with the hospital that's
02:54:44.880 cbs news
02:54:46.960 jamie's going to find that right now you
02:54:48.240 type in bill gates grilled
02:54:50.560 over over vaccine dangers you know cbs
02:54:53.040 reporting
02:54:53.680 but the point is they admit a bunch of
02:54:55.439 vaccine deaths have happened now
02:54:57.120 from the test but what was i going to do
02:54:59.120 before then you were just talking about
02:55:00.640 mrna oh behavioral yeah behavioral
02:55:02.720 modification
02:55:03.600 yeah so type in vaccine to cure heroin
02:55:07.120 addiction
02:55:07.680 but we're going to get to that but
02:55:09.120 before we get to that we got to google
02:55:10.960 the stats on mrna vaccines because that
02:55:13.600 this is going to be highly contested so
02:55:15.760 we have to find out well no you can time
02:55:17.040 i'm not going to show you the clip
02:55:18.319 bill gates but we just googled the stats
02:55:21.920 on mrna uh
02:55:25.359 patients in the trial i don't even i
02:55:27.359 think they don't have a stats on that
02:55:29.200 so how do you know it bill gates was on
02:55:31.279 cbs news
02:55:32.240 and he said 80 of the people get sick
02:55:34.560 yeah
02:55:35.359 and 20 percent of them go to the
02:55:36.720 hospital no it was two vaccines they
02:55:39.120 said one vaccine 100
02:55:40.640 got sick and a certain percent went to
02:55:44.080 the hospital
02:55:44.800 the other 80 got sick and 20 of those
02:55:47.600 and sometimes that does happen even the
02:55:49.279 flu vaccine right like sometimes people
02:55:50.960 get
02:55:51.200 i swear to god you type in bill gates
02:55:53.920 grilled by cbs i'll bring it up
02:55:56.240 right certain vaccines do get people a
02:55:58.720 little we had that conversation with the
02:56:00.160 whole thing in india you know he
02:56:01.439 introduced a lot of vaccines in india

02:59:00.399 health organization says a new polio
02:59:02.800 outbreak in sudan is linked to an
02:59:04.640 ongoing vaccine-sparked
02:59:06.479 epidemic in chad a week after the u.s
02:59:09.040 vaccine
02:59:09.680 sparked epidemic health agency declared
02:59:12.160 the african continent free of the
02:59:14.000 wild polio vaccine world health
02:59:16.160 organization said it found 11 additional
02:59:18.520 vaccine-derived
02:59:19.840 polio cases in sudan and that the virus
02:59:22.560 had been identified in environmental
02:59:24.640 samples
02:59:25.920 there are typically many more unreported
02:59:28.240 cases for every confirmed polio patient
02:59:31.200 the highly infectious disease can spread
02:59:33.439 quickly in contaminated water
02:59:35.520 and most often strikes children under
02:59:37.680 five [ __ ]
02:59:39.359 jesus christ in rare instances the live
02:59:42.640 polio virus
02:59:43.680 in the oral vaccine can mutate in a form
02:59:46.800 capable of sparking new outbreaks so let
02:59:49.680 me tell you a story
02:59:50.960 my grandmother died three years ago at
02:59:52.880 92.
02:59:54.240 incredible woman that's [ __ ] terrible
02:59:56.000 she was told by her doctor
02:59:57.920 in 1954 when she got the second polio
03:00:01.279 shot they said sorry it was live
03:00:03.279 it paralyzed her she was on crutches
03:00:05.359 rest for life they told her it didn't
03:00:06.960 turn
03:00:08.000 jesus christ so see i just told you that
03:00:11.040 yeah it's true and that's a whitewash
03:00:12.960 what ap is doing
03:00:14.720 i would imagine so i'm telling you i
03:00:17.520 make mistakes because i can't remember
03:00:19.040 all this stuff i understand you remember
03:00:20.720 a lot
03:00:21.680 but i'm not trying to lie i wish the

03:00:29.120 like to finish up my work
03:00:30.479 clean up mistakes i made talk about
03:00:32.319 other stuff

03:00:39.520 stressed out joe i'm done i know you are
03:00:41.040 i know

03:00:52.160 i can't do this much longer and i want
03:00:54.560 everybody to know i love my crew but i
03:00:55.920 told them i can't keep running this
03:00:57.040 operation
03:00:58.080 i just want to tell the truth and i want
03:00:59.520 to get out the next year doesn't mean i
03:01:01.120 won't go on your show once a year do
03:01:02.399 like a write a book or something but i
03:01:03.600 want you to get healthy
03:01:05.040 i need to get older i try to get healthy
03:01:06.640 why don't you hire a trainer and hire a
03:01:08.479 dietitian
03:01:10.560 i try because i know you got off the
03:01:12.240 booze for quite a while and
03:01:13.600 we were talking you said you felt great
03:01:15.520 i did feel great i lost like 40 pounds
03:01:17.200 how long did you get off the booze for
03:01:18.640 four months no alcohol about eight
03:01:20.319 months and barely any
03:01:21.920 like the last three or four hours right
03:01:23.200 back but you you you were talking to me
03:01:24.960 about adderall
03:01:25.760 the problem you know i want you to talk
03:01:26.960 about that because that's a good thing
03:01:28.399 for people to hear
03:01:29.520 the the the problems that you had with
03:01:31.200 adderall because that [ __ ] scares the
03:01:32.800 [ __ ] out of me well i'm not gonna get
03:01:34.160 any of that type of stuff
03:01:35.520 the point is is that it's is that the
03:01:37.279 things that doctors push the things that
03:01:38.800 go on
03:01:39.680 the whole country's drugged up on a
03:01:41.040 bunch of stuff yeah and uh
03:01:42.880 it's it's it's not good but i'm not i do
03:01:45.439 caffeine and alcohol that's it
03:01:47.520 and and it's all very very destructive
03:01:50.080 and you know
03:01:51.120 it gets to the point where like you're
03:01:52.560 exhausted unless you drink
03:01:54.560 and it's not a good thing that's why i'm
03:01:56.960 glad you sober in october last october i
03:01:59.279 was sober
03:02:00.240 yeah um do you think you could
03:02:03.279 just kick it totally i mean you kicked
03:02:06.160 it for four months
03:02:07.279 do you think it'd be if i wasn't doing a
03:02:09.040 show every day and having to read i mean
03:02:10.960 i'm not exaggerating i read
03:02:14.319 50 articles i probably scanned a 500 i
03:02:17.279 mean i
03:02:18.000 look at so much stuff that it's just
03:02:19.760 it's enslaving me like i
03:02:21.920 i just want to i don't want to be around
03:02:24.720 it anymore
03:02:25.520 it's not like i'm scared of it i'm just
03:02:27.040 i want to be something else it's
03:02:28.720 negative it has negative consequences in
03:02:30.399 your health
03:02:31.279 yeah so so for me i just want to get
03:02:34.080 away from all of it
03:02:35.439 and what do you want to do i'd love to
03:02:38.560 go hunting fishing and
03:02:40.319 relaxing and oil painting and doing
03:02:42.560 sculpture i love metal sculpture
03:02:45.040 i love that that's a beautiful
03:02:46.240 chimpanzee skull guy right there i mean
03:02:48.319 i just i've done this 26 27 years
03:02:50.960 and when you've done it that long you
03:02:52.800 want to stand the fight at the same time
03:02:54.240 you want to not do it anymore
03:02:56.000 and that's the thing about people the
03:02:57.520 democrats suing me and attacking me
03:03:00.560 before trump even got elected i was
03:03:01.920 already telling people i'm gonna shut
03:03:02.880 this company down
03:03:04.000 i can't fund all of you i can't do this
03:03:05.760 anymore them attacking me
03:03:08.000 made me keep fighting do you think that
03:03:11.600 if if you were healthier if you
03:03:15.359 maybe just did less
03:03:18.960 you you could be all right with it
03:03:22.640 i didn't do that as a stunt i'm in quite
03:03:24.240 honest with you i'm a smart i'm a smart
03:03:26.880 i think i'm going to die of a heart
03:03:27.920 attack at like 50 something i'm 47 now
03:03:30.960 and i just i just have to like there's
03:03:33.040 no way to do this
03:03:34.240 full-time either you do it or you turn
03:03:36.479 loose
03:03:37.279 and i'd like to just for a few years
03:03:38.960 just disappear so you think that
03:03:41.439 the amount of [ __ ] that's out there and
03:03:43.600 when and this is a problem with
03:03:45.439 conspiracies right because you keep
03:03:46.720 finding more and more and more that are
03:03:48.399 provable
03:03:49.359 and you start going crazy because you
03:03:52.160 start
03:03:52.640 really exactly and you lose who you
03:03:55.840 exactly like yeah i don't like the
03:03:57.439 globalist i'm not giving in to them i'm
03:03:59.040 giving in to like my own body
03:04:00.640 i understand it's not like their attacks
03:04:02.560 keep me fighting them
03:04:04.000 like they keep thinking like oh this
03:04:05.359 mess with me more he'll give up that
03:04:06.960 makes me like attack more
03:04:08.800 it's and i'm trying to like get him to
03:04:10.080 top attacking me it's not some
03:04:11.200 machiavellian thing i'm saying
03:04:13.040 i just want to like i don't want to be i
03:04:14.880 don't want to look at the news
03:04:16.160 maybe if he just took some time off and
03:04:18.560 like
03:04:19.200 it just got healthy maybe maybe maybe
03:04:21.520 that's what you need maybe you just need
03:04:22.640 a
03:04:22.880 extended vacation i mean you're your own
03:04:25.600 boss
03:04:26.240 right you could do that do you ever
03:04:27.760 think you maybe shrink the operation
03:04:29.359 down a little bit
03:04:30.160 and then you can kind of do what you
03:04:32.080 want how you want
03:04:33.680 you know instead of instead of just
03:04:35.120 being a 24-hour day
03:04:37.040 operation you could just take it down
03:04:38.720 well here's my problem when you get
03:04:40.080 personal
03:04:41.279 i mean i had perfect teeth till like two
03:04:43.040 years ago i have to wear a
03:04:44.960 mouth brace because i'll literally crush
03:04:46.720 my teeth when i'm asleep
03:04:48.080 like i broke one just the other day i
03:04:50.080 got implants going in right here
03:04:51.840 and i'm just like literally in my sleep
03:04:54.640 clenching my teeth so hard
03:04:56.399 that i've got like giant muscles like
03:04:58.880 i'm not arnold schwarzenegger but my
03:05:00.240 jaws
03:05:00.720 are right like they're like look like a
03:05:02.240 chipmunk and it's because that's
03:05:04.080 psychologically i'm trying to defeat all
03:05:05.760 this
03:05:06.560 and it's just like it's like a certain
03:05:08.000 point i can't do it all right
03:05:09.760 so i don't feel sorry for myself you've
03:05:11.520 earned it you've earned some time off
03:05:13.120 yeah why don't you just take take some
03:05:14.720 months off just
03:05:16.479 like mark an extended hiatus you know
03:05:19.439 whenever you feel like you could get
03:05:20.800 away and just
03:05:21.920 decide you're going to take three months
03:05:23.439 off put the [ __ ] cell phone down
03:05:26.080 eat healthy exercise you mean you could
03:05:27.920 hire a trainer
03:05:29.439 you know not a bad idea there's nothing
03:05:32.080 i want to do more than that
03:05:33.520 because you know what i'm doing the
03:05:34.800 sober october thing and when i've
03:05:36.880 done it in the past one of the things
03:05:38.640 we've done is these fitness challenges
03:05:41.120 you don't even realize what you can do
03:05:43.760 until you're forced to do something
03:05:45.520 if you force yourself like say hey for
03:05:47.840 the month of uh
03:05:49.840 january i'm not gonna drink and i'm
03:05:52.479 gonna exercise every day
03:05:54.160 and i'm gonna put it up on you know my
03:05:56.640 website and let everybody know what i'm
03:05:58.560 doing and
03:05:59.600 and just force yourself to to try to get
03:06:02.160 healthy
03:06:02.640 only eat healthy food and maybe get a
03:06:05.200 dietitian
03:06:06.080 maybe get a trainer not even maybe get a
03:06:08.880 dietitian get a trainer
03:06:10.319 get someone who makes you uh like meal
03:06:12.319 preps for you
03:06:13.359 gives you a healthy food to eat and this
03:06:14.880 is all you're going to eat is this stuff
03:06:16.560 no
03:06:16.880 no processed [ __ ] just healthy food
03:06:19.760 wouldn't be a bad idea just take a whole
03:06:21.600 month
03:06:22.160 and do nothing but that just leave the
03:06:23.680 [ __ ] news alone let this crazy world
03:06:26.080 sort itself out
03:06:27.600 no i agree because now i look at news
03:06:29.359 and it's just like you still like oh i
03:06:31.279 got them right here on the speaker
03:06:32.800 i was like now almost like oh my god
03:06:35.120 yeah because you're probably overrun
03:06:37.120 you know it's probably taxed out your
03:06:39.120 body's probably like barely hanging in
03:06:41.120 there
03:06:42.240 i mean if you're boozing a lot and
03:06:44.000 you're not getting sleep and you're
03:06:45.279 grinding your teeth
03:06:46.560 none of these are good signs
03:06:49.920 i'll be honest about the listeners but
03:06:52.000 you know at the end of the day
03:06:53.200 like this is fundamental this is an
03:06:55.279 anti-human movement
03:06:56.880 it's a globalist movement and i get
03:06:58.720 people that are doing it are sociopaths
03:07:00.800 that have created cosmology
03:07:02.560 to explain why they're doing all these
03:07:03.840 evil things i just i feel like it's such
03:07:06.319 an important mission
03:07:08.080 that it should be exposed and joe i'm
03:07:09.760 just glad you moved to austin
03:07:11.200 i'm glad that tim's here tim's moving he
03:07:13.840 just told me
03:07:15.600 i got to save la first and then i want
03:07:17.520 to go work with bill and melinda gates
03:07:19.120 for a while and then i will come to
03:07:20.800 austin you can't save la
03:07:22.399 i know i know we'll see november 3rd
03:07:26.880 so joe what is your prediction who wins
03:07:29.359 who wins in six days
03:07:30.640 i'm not smart enough to make the
03:07:32.080 prediction but i trump's gonna win i
03:07:33.680 think it's going to be chaos
03:07:35.279 either way it's gonna be chaos i think
03:07:37.200 of trump i've never
03:07:38.960 ever in my life felt this country more
03:07:41.279 divided
03:07:42.000 it feels more divided now than i've ever
03:07:44.080 felt before
03:07:45.040 where the the possibility of a civil war
03:07:47.920 doesn't seem
03:07:48.720 outside the realm of of possibilities it
03:07:51.439 doesn't seem like something ridiculous
03:07:53.279 it doesn't like people used to say if
03:07:54.560 they said it in the past someone said
03:07:56.560 oh this country is on the brink of a
03:07:57.840 civil war 10 years ago i'd be like
03:07:59.439 listen this crazy [ __ ]
03:08:01.279 but you say it now and i go like i could
03:08:04.640 see it
03:08:05.120 tim why are you not moving to texas well
03:08:07.600 i i might advance
03:08:08.880 this i might eventually i don't know
03:08:10.640 we're gonna see i gotta move
03:08:12.000 i gotta open a car joe convinced me that
03:08:13.439 joe told me to move to la a year ago
03:08:15.200 and then i moved and it just destroyed
03:08:17.359 so tell me to move here i might move
03:08:19.200 here it'll be a problem we're going to
03:08:20.479 start a comedy club out here yeah
03:08:22.080 we're going to set this place up right
03:08:24.240 well thank you for having me
03:08:25.359 my pleasure appreciate it but i
03:08:26.720 appreciate you being here with
03:08:27.600 everything else i hope that would be
03:08:28.880 good this is a great one alex i think
03:08:30.960 people got to see a side of you
03:08:32.800 that they maybe even didn't see in the
03:08:34.640 other two podcasts
03:08:36.080 you know i think you you did a great
03:08:38.000 account of yourself and
03:08:39.359 i think really you think so yeah yeah a
03:08:41.520 lot of the [ __ ] that you brought up
03:08:42.560 today was
03:08:43.600 i mean you were pulling [ __ ] off the top
03:08:46.720 of your head and
03:08:47.760 a lot of it was accurate a good solid
03:08:50.560 percentage i'm not trying to [ __ ]
03:08:52.000 no you're not trying to [ __ ] no i
03:08:53.600 know you're not and this is what i've
03:08:54.720 always told people about you
03:08:56.080 and and again i think that
03:08:59.279 we're at a critical time where we've got
03:09:02.160 to rethink
03:09:03.040 all these people that are calling for
03:09:04.399 people to be censored and calling for
03:09:06.240 people to be de-platform and i think you
03:09:08.000 got to rethink this
03:09:09.200 i think everybody has to rethink this
03:09:10.560 because you you might be looking back on
03:09:12.000 this 10 years from now
03:09:13.040 and going oh my god what the [ __ ] did i
03:09:14.960 support but i agree with you but we
03:09:16.560 should
03:09:17.040 you're being nice to the sensors they're
03:09:19.760 tyrants
03:09:20.880 we should hear everybody's views i think
03:09:22.560 there's a lot of people
03:09:24.000 in this in this machine and a lot of
03:09:26.080 these people they're not tyrants they
03:09:27.920 think they're doing good
03:09:29.359 they really do i think there's a lot of
03:09:31.120 people that are out there calling for
03:09:32.399 people to be
03:09:33.279 de-platform calling for people to be
03:09:35.439 censored because maybe they have
03:09:36.960 children
03:09:37.439 they see their children being
03:09:38.479 indoctrinated into q and on or all this
03:09:40.239 kind of
03:09:40.800 ridiculous thinking and maybe they they
03:09:43.359 think that the way to
03:09:44.800 to fight some of this [ __ ] is to just
03:09:47.920 take that stuff offline so the kids have
03:09:49.840 no no access
03:09:50.960 that only makes their children want it
03:09:52.239 more well not only that it makes the
03:09:54.880 people that
03:09:55.680 believe that there's a conspiracy to
03:09:57.279 silence the truth it makes them
03:09:58.880 even more fervent in their beliefs they
03:10:00.880 they start believing it even
03:10:02.479 more rabidly and not only that it it it
03:10:05.840 it creates echo chambers
03:10:07.359 and then this positive you are happy you
03:10:09.840 move to texas i [ __ ] love it here i
03:10:11.920 love the people i love the i love the
03:10:13.760 town
