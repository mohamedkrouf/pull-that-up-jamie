00:00:00.080 Jam is a wild man you don't understand
00:00:01.920 and you're still getting late it's crazy
00:00:03.679 look at him you are three two one we're
00:00:08.200 live got to change subjects Le Remy got
00:00:11.080 to abandon all that crazy talk we were
00:00:12.799 just talking good it was it was
00:00:14.400 definitely good talk um first of all
00:00:17.920 it's good to see you you too I haven't
00:00:19.520 seen you in a long time you look great
00:00:20.880 haven't you do too I haven't seen you
00:00:22.240 since King of Queens been a long time
00:00:24.000 it's crazy and um I found out about you
00:00:28.320 know the whole Scientology thing I knew
00:00:30.160 you were into it back then but it was
00:00:32.640 one of those things where I'd heard
00:00:33.800 about it yeah and then I met you I'm
00:00:35.559 like well she pretty normal for
00:00:37.840 tell right well I I met Johnta once too
00:00:40.239 and I said the same thing like pretty
00:00:41.960 normal nice guy Kelly Preston is pretty
00:00:44.120 normal she's normal you know it's I
00:00:46.600 guess you get deeper get to know them
00:00:49.120 really well and it might get a little
00:00:50.719 weird but yes yeah because the the thing
00:00:53.399 is scientologists are good people they
00:00:55.680 really are it's they they really as I
00:00:58.039 did believed that we are doing amazing
00:01:00.920 things for the world so they go into it
00:01:04.280 thinking I'm I'm helping myself and I'm
00:01:05.960 helping others right um but then as you
00:01:09.880 like you said as you get more and more
00:01:12.600 uh and by the way you don't really get
00:01:15.000 close to Scientologist when you're a
00:01:16.479 scient like when you're a non when
00:01:18.320 you're non Scientologist correct like
00:01:20.000 everything that I did and they do is for
00:01:24.079 the purpose of um setting a good example
00:01:27.759 being a good person being a good friend
00:01:30.680 um so to get you in there there's a
00:01:34.200 purpose in that like I would never tell
00:01:37.119 when I was in a non- Scientologist my
00:01:39.399 real problems it would be kind of uh bad
00:01:42.799 for the church to ever appear human whoa
00:01:46.200 to a non- Scientologist it would be
00:01:47.960 setting a bad example like it would
00:01:49.799 actually be considered like a
00:01:51.280 transgression if I told you Joe you know
00:01:54.719 oh yeah I'm fighting with my mother I'm
00:01:56.799 fighting with my husband or I wouldn't
00:01:59.200 never tell those types of things because
00:02:01.560 it would be bad PR for the church wow so
00:02:04.759 that's something that you're taught
00:02:06.680 correct now you you kind of grew up in
00:02:08.959 it yes how old were you when you nine I
00:02:11.640 think when my mother so you don't even
00:02:13.000 remember pre Scientology a little bit
00:02:15.239 and you know what I remember pre-
00:02:16.959 Scientology was you know I had a very
00:02:19.959 Catholic Sicilian father who you know
00:02:23.440 believed in punishment believed in not
00:02:25.640 talk like did I talk to you I don't know
00:02:27.640 why you're talking to me like that kind
00:02:29.200 of guy
00:02:30.560 right like my my dad sits at the head of
00:02:32.480 the table and then we don't talk back at
00:02:35.239 all or you know so that is kind of what
00:02:38.319 I knew and then uh we were baptized as
00:02:40.760 Catholics because my mother wasn't
00:02:42.120 really religious my mother's Jewish
00:02:43.959 she's you know so she but she didn't
00:02:46.200 have any kind of religion growing up my
00:02:48.280 father of course was Catholic so we got
00:02:50.640 baptized as Catholics and the only time
00:02:53.200 we really went to church was with our
00:02:54.519 grandma we went to visit her in you know
00:02:57.480 in the city and my dad on holidays so uh
00:03:02.680 that's really kind of all I remember pre
00:03:05.760 Scientology and my mother meeting my
00:03:08.519 stepdad he was in Scientology and he got
00:03:10.720 her in as well us like right away right
00:03:14.239 away yes so that was like part of the
00:03:16.080 deal correct wow yeah and and by the way
00:03:18.519 Joe like we went from like don't talk
00:03:20.920 until you're spoken to to hey we see you
00:03:24.120 as Spiritual Beings we want you to talk
00:03:27.519 to us we want you to communicate like
00:03:29.799 you're just you're not you're not
00:03:31.640 children you're you know Spirits in a
00:03:34.439 little body and so immediately that kind
00:03:36.400 of indoctrination begins that you're not
00:03:39.120 a child and so you know as children you
00:03:41.239 have kids you know they always want to
00:03:43.239 be grownup so that that really starts to
00:03:46.560 work this kind of idea that you're an
00:03:49.040 elitist that your your ego becomes kind
00:03:51.480 of stroked as a kid like you're very
00:03:53.400 powerful and you returned and you came
00:03:56.040 back and you found yourself back you
00:03:59.159 picked your mother because you knew
00:04:00.640 she'd get into Scientology and you're
00:04:02.280 very strong Leah and you're very strong
00:04:03.959 Nicole to my sister you picked your
00:04:05.879 mother you picked your mother for this
00:04:07.760 reason to find your way back to
00:04:09.079 Scientology now as a child remember you
00:04:12.400 you want to be more important than you
00:04:13.920 are kids are always trying to exercise
00:04:15.560 their power you know so that speaks to
00:04:18.120 something inside of you that like oh I'm
00:04:20.040 bigger than a kid I'm more than a kid
00:04:21.839 I'm a spiritual being in a little body
00:04:24.280 and so it sets up that kind of
00:04:25.600 indoctrination very early on did you
00:04:28.000 like it because it made you when you
00:04:30.039 were young it made you feel like okay
00:04:31.479 now I can express myself better I don't
00:04:33.960 feel suppressed feel exactly because you
00:04:36.320 know again I'm going from a dad who
00:04:38.199 tells me to you know shut the f up and
00:04:40.560 talk when I talk to you and you sit in
00:04:42.720 that chair and you don't have any
00:04:44.759 thoughts worth listening to to you're
00:04:48.360 very much an important being you're a
00:04:50.520 big being that's a a word that's used a
00:04:52.520 lot those words big beings you're a big
00:04:55.000 being um and so yes you start to feel
00:04:57.720 very important you start to feel
00:05:00.560 um that you're powerful these are not
00:05:03.120 bad things to make kids feel but this is
00:05:06.280 the way Cults work and you don't realize
00:05:09.280 that Joe until you're out you don't
00:05:11.280 realize any of this was really going on
00:05:13.320 because I've heard people call it a cult
00:05:15.800 throughout my 30 plus years and I I was
00:05:18.680 offended by it I was so deeply offended
00:05:21.000 by it and I couldn't even allow myself
00:05:23.520 to believe that I was in a cult and so
00:05:27.039 all these epiphanies are only happening
00:05:29.000 you know after the fact well I was
00:05:31.319 watching a scholarly documentary once on
00:05:33.240 Christianity and they were referring to
00:05:35.199 it as the cult of Christianity and um
00:05:39.039 it's it's that word is the correct word
00:05:42.600 if you want to just look at it in terms
00:05:44.319 of the the actual literal definition of
00:05:46.120 it but when any it's automatically got
00:05:48.960 this negative connotation you say the
00:05:50.479 word cult and people think you're
00:05:52.120 brainwashed you're lost but right there
00:05:55.560 there's a there's a natural inclination
00:05:57.960 that people have to be tribal there's a
00:06:00.120 natural inclination people have to be on
00:06:01.840 a team and we like it when we're all
00:06:03.919 together you know I know you're a
00:06:05.720 Scientologist I'm a Scientologist we're
00:06:07.440 together in this thing everybody else
00:06:08.919 doesn't get it right and that's that's a
00:06:10.840 good feeling right yeah and you're
00:06:12.280 taught that it's not even just that you
00:06:14.240 think it Joe you you are taught that you
00:06:16.520 are the Elite of the world um and and by
00:06:20.120 the way you're going in every single day
00:06:21.919 it's not like I'm going I'm going Easter
00:06:24.720 and I'm going Christmas you know it's an
00:06:27.160 everydayness so what did you do every
00:06:29.080 day like when you say you went in so i'
00:06:30.759 go do King of Queens and then after
00:06:33.000 rehearsal I'd have to drive to Hollywood
00:06:35.280 and put in my 2 and 1/2 hours a day 2
00:06:37.560 and a half hours every day yeah every
00:06:39.599 minimum Jo no minimum okay so then if I
00:06:43.000 couldn't like let's say on a tape day I
00:06:44.720 couldn't you know I was there from 9:00
00:06:46.160 in the morning till 10: at night as you
00:06:47.599 know I'd have to make up the time on the
00:06:49.800 weekends or I'd have to make up time on
00:06:51.680 my Hiatus so I'd be there all day and
00:06:54.520 night so like what if you went to Hawaii
00:06:56.160 on vacation or something very rare that
00:06:58.080 scientologists would go on vacation I'd
00:06:59.840 have to make up the time I'd have to
00:07:01.720 make up the time when I got back I'd
00:07:03.240 have to put in on weekends like let's
00:07:04.960 say if my schedule was you know 12 to
00:07:07.360 2:30 to go in then I'd have to go in 1
00:07:09.919 to 6 or 1 to 10 or 9 to 10 so there's an
00:07:13.720 everydayness of this indoctrination it's
00:07:15.919 not only that there's it it's policies
00:07:18.720 right you're studying the policies all
00:07:21.560 day and all night you're looking up
00:07:23.000 words you don't understand you're being
00:07:24.520 tested like after you read an elron H
00:07:27.440 you know elron Herbert's policy then
00:07:28.840 you're tested you go into another room
00:07:30.840 and they go what is the definition of
00:07:32.199 this what is the definition of that so
00:07:34.199 it's it's almost worse uh we had a cult
00:07:36.879 expert on and he said it's worse I it's
00:07:39.400 worse because you actually brainwash
00:07:41.199 yourself because you have to study the
00:07:44.000 policies of the church and then you get
00:07:45.720 tested on it and you have to look up
00:07:47.400 that words you don't understand you have
00:07:48.759 to put them in sentences you have to
00:07:50.199 write essays you have to do clay
00:07:52.520 demonstrations so you're really
00:07:54.440 brainwashing yourself and you're
00:07:56.080 speaking all the same language you're
00:07:58.680 all working towards one goal and that is
00:08:02.800 very intoxicating like it is to feel
00:08:05.000 like you're saying to be tribal to be
00:08:07.479 part of something imagine being
00:08:08.919 something part of something that you
00:08:10.720 think and and are told and are reading
00:08:13.599 every day is the most important thing
00:08:16.280 that's going to save mankind you are
00:08:18.599 doing the work that no other group is
00:08:20.400 doing and so you believe that you start
00:08:22.879 you want to believe that you want to
00:08:24.400 believe I'm more than just an actress
00:08:26.720 I'm more than just this I'm saving the
00:08:28.840 planet and now all this stuff that
00:08:30.800 you're doing you're going in for two and
00:08:32.080 a half hours every day and are are you
00:08:35.039 trying to move your way up the ranking
00:08:37.719 system like CU I know there's some
00:08:39.519 there's a chart right right and
00:08:41.120 everybody start off at uh well there's
00:08:44.440 like uh the Indo like the the little
00:08:46.880 courses they're called self-improvement
00:08:48.640 courses and these are the things that I
00:08:50.800 people like me would say like when
00:08:52.360 people would ask me about the money
00:08:53.880 right I said well there's courses for
00:08:55.399 $35
00:08:57.040 $65 you know it's all it's very
00:09:00.040 affordable like these these are the
00:09:01.560 lines that we're taught to say it's not
00:09:04.040 an outright lie it's it's omitting a lot
00:09:07.480 of data right right because really the
00:09:10.160 the next the followup to that is but
00:09:13.200 when you're really a Scientologist it's
00:09:14.600 going to cost you a half a million easy
00:09:17.040 or whatever it's going to be but it's
00:09:19.480 preset prices so you start on these
00:09:21.519 self-improvement courses and then you
00:09:23.200 get onto this actual chart called the
00:09:26.120 bridge and um the bridge is very uh
00:09:29.959 precise nobody's doing different things
00:09:31.800 you're all working at the bottom all the
00:09:33.959 way up to the top which was um ot8
00:09:37.720 that's like the most enlightened how
00:09:39.519 many people are ot8 uh not a lot anymore
00:09:43.160 because the people who were in
00:09:44.880 Scientology in the 50s 60s and 70s who
00:09:47.480 got to
00:09:48.519 ot8 uh were like this is some
00:09:51.519 it wasn't what I thought it was going to
00:09:52.880 be and so a lot of them left at a time
00:09:55.600 I'm sure Scientology was big because it
00:09:58.079 was almost it almost spoke to the time
00:10:01.839 that it was you know where people wanted
00:10:03.680 free thinking but also wanted to be
00:10:06.399 morally on the right path you know not
00:10:08.519 doing drugs like they were you know
00:10:10.959 maybe not part of that but they they
00:10:12.720 kind of didn't want to be held by uh uh
00:10:16.640 you know a certain uh religion but they
00:10:19.160 did still want spirituality in their
00:10:20.880 life and I think it spoke to the people
00:10:22.600 of the time um so I don't think you're
00:10:25.600 you're going to find new scientologists
00:10:28.040 you know it in the world like so do you
00:10:30.480 think the internet took a big chunk out
00:10:31.839 of that yes because of the information
00:10:35.440 information was very hard to get uh for
00:10:38.040 example oh yeah for example let's say
00:10:40.120 you were a Scientologist and um one day
00:10:42.839 I just didn't see you and I said hey
00:10:44.079 what happened to Joe where's Joe why is
00:10:46.279 he not in Scientology anymore oh they
00:10:48.519 they tell me whatever they want to tell
00:10:50.000 me about you to discredit you he's an
00:10:52.320 enemy to the church and here are the
00:10:53.839 reasons why and they could say anything
00:10:56.720 and they do say anything that
00:10:58.240 immediately makes me not want to talk to
00:11:00.200 you ever again well and then become an
00:11:02.240 enemy really you're an enemy once you're
00:11:03.880 an enemy I can't actually talk to you I
00:11:06.360 can't actually talk to you the policy
00:11:08.320 says that once you are declared labeled
00:11:12.040 a suppressive person my association with
00:11:14.680 you would then make me a suppressive
00:11:17.200 person and then me an enemy so I can't
00:11:19.160 actually talk to you but they can tell
00:11:21.680 me whatever they want to tell me about
00:11:23.480 you and so I couldn't actually find out
00:11:25.720 are these things true about Joe but now
00:11:28.639 with the internet with social media it's
00:11:30.680 harder and harder to to tell people
00:11:33.959 whatever you want to tell them about the
00:11:35.440 person because the information is there
00:11:38.440 um you have to want to seek it out I
00:11:40.800 didn't seek it out um I didn't want to
00:11:43.639 seek it out and when I did seek it out
00:11:45.360 and I'd go to the church they'd say
00:11:47.000 that's a lie that's not true here's the
00:11:49.920 real data and they have actual doctored
00:11:53.200 you know
00:11:54.560 um they they actually doctor things that
00:11:57.839 make you believe I mean you don't you're
00:11:59.320 not going to go and take it to an
00:12:00.600 analyst you're not going to go take it
00:12:01.680 to somebody and go is this a real
00:12:03.399 document um you you tend to believe the
00:12:05.959 church you're you're in and raised in
00:12:07.880 most of your life now it had to have
00:12:12.320 been positive in some way for you of
00:12:14.880 course it gave you some confidence it
00:12:16.680 gave you a true belief in yourself and
00:12:18.440 that you were on the right path because
00:12:20.199 I had seen some interviews with you
00:12:21.600 where you were talking about it when you
00:12:22.760 were in it and you genuinely seemed to
00:12:25.279 believe that it was very beneficial to
00:12:26.959 you of course there's basic
00:12:29.639 um morals and basic tools to help you in
00:12:33.160 your life but remember I wasn't educated
00:12:35.920 most scientologists are not educated and
00:12:38.560 so you mean as far as like college
00:12:39.880 education any education yeah I left
00:12:42.160 school in the eth grade really yeah
00:12:44.120 Scientology does not value a traditional
00:12:47.519 education they value your education so
00:12:50.320 you never went to high school never W
00:12:53.160 how old were you I don't know how old
00:12:54.800 are you in high school look I don't even
00:12:55.760 know eighth grade is like 13 I think
00:12:57.720 right so when you were 13 you just
00:12:59.720 stopped going to school stopped going to
00:13:01.199 school and I was doing Scientology and I
00:13:03.120 was working like literally working
00:13:05.160 selling car insurance and you were
00:13:07.240 working at 13 for Scientology companies
00:13:09.760 and so was my sister holy yeah but
00:13:12.920 uh and people ask like well how come the
00:13:16.480 um nobody did anything how come Child
00:13:18.880 Protective Services who's calling them
00:13:20.800 who's saying and not to mention where
00:13:23.279 we're then lying our parents are lying
00:13:25.160 saying they're getting uh private
00:13:26.600 education they're getting um tutored um
00:13:29.639 at home or they're going to a
00:13:31.320 Scientology School which is partially
00:13:33.600 true um or I I got my GED you know so I
00:13:37.680 did things like that to to um but the
00:13:41.600 the original question what what was the
00:13:43.360 because it was
00:13:44.360 about me learning what it was about wait
00:13:47.560 what was your original question cuz I
00:13:48.839 was answering well I saying that it it
00:13:50.399 had to be of some benefit to you gave
00:13:52.519 you confidence it gave me confidence cuz
00:13:54.320 I thought I was getting you know I'm
00:13:55.800 looking up these big words I'm using a
00:13:57.440 dictionary I'm like doing more school
00:13:59.880 than you could have ever imagined even
00:14:01.399 as you know right and and you um I
00:14:05.240 started to feel like oh I'm I'm really
00:14:07.839 accomplishing something I'm so yes there
00:14:11.079 there are benefits to it but I didn't
00:14:13.079 realize because I was a kid that the
00:14:16.360 things you're talking about that were
00:14:17.680 beneficial were in the real world I
00:14:19.720 thought they were they were invented by
00:14:21.800 elen hubard as most people do believe
00:14:24.600 that so you're saying were these things
00:14:26.519 beneficial I would have learned these
00:14:28.320 things as Sunday school I would have
00:14:30.040 learned these things about being a good
00:14:31.440 human being being around other people
00:14:34.320 but regardless if I was brainwashed into
00:14:36.680 believing that I was doing great things
00:14:39.480 and learning great things then that does
00:14:41.639 work you know what I mean it it does
00:14:44.320 work if I say Hey Joe if you do these
00:14:46.720 steps you take these steps and you
00:14:48.120 really truly believe in me you can then
00:14:51.199 attribute it to Leah you can say Leah is
00:14:52.959 an amazing life coach she told me to do
00:14:54.880 these things and without her I can't you
00:14:57.240 you know what I'm saying so it but not
00:14:59.079 knowing that it was available to me in
00:15:00.560 the real world because I didn't I
00:15:02.480 thought Elon Hubbert had come up with
00:15:03.959 these
00:15:05.199 things now when did it start to unravel
00:15:07.720 for you well it's a like a long
00:15:11.320 it's it wasn't just one thing I I think
00:15:14.600 people always think what was the one it
00:15:16.360 wasn't just one thing it was a slow
00:15:18.120 process it was a it was six years of me
00:15:22.920 basically I was like begging them for
00:15:25.399 these things not to be true that I was
00:15:27.199 hearing about like what was for example
00:15:30.600 when I went to Tom Cruz's wedding and I
00:15:34.040 saw the leader's wife wasn't there and
00:15:36.480 you know David mavage who's the head of
00:15:38.160 the Church of
00:15:39.360 Scientology uh his wife wasn't there and
00:15:41.519 when I asked the question and I said
00:15:43.880 where is Shelly why is his assistant
00:15:46.319 here um scattered people just scattered
00:15:49.800 and then I was told I didn't have the
00:15:51.160 effing rank to be asking about a human
00:15:53.720 about the leader's wife it wasn't that
00:15:55.440 she was just an average person that I
00:15:57.120 didn't have the rank to ask about you
00:15:59.000 the rank the rank wow and
00:16:03.160 so that that would be okay that was the
00:16:05.920 beginning but then when I went to my
00:16:07.480 friends now when you're my friend I
00:16:11.079 consider you family like I really do I I
00:16:13.600 take my friends very seriously and um my
00:16:17.800 friends of 35 years you're looking at my
00:16:20.199 sexy Nails right now your what nails my
00:16:22.600 sexy Nails sexy Nails you do have very
00:16:24.560 nice nails you didn't use the word sexy
00:16:26.720 though you said nice uh W you know I'm
00:16:29.279 different than other people when it
00:16:30.199 comes to Nails apparently because the
00:16:31.959 conversation now when you say real what
00:16:33.880 does that mean are they glued on no
00:16:35.360 they're not glued on oh then I'm
00:16:36.399 appreciating them more oh
00:16:39.279 okay we're finding out a lot about you I
00:16:42.560 I'd like to do a whole couple hours with
00:16:45.319 you talking about other things do I have
00:16:47.880 to hold on to cans and how you don't
00:16:49.560 have to hold on to cans but you do have
00:16:50.639 to wear cologne cuz I'm not down with
00:16:52.160 your non- colog wearing okay you're too
00:16:54.639 cute for no clone um so okay so let me
00:16:58.399 get back was I saying David miscavage
00:17:00.319 you didn't have the right to question
00:17:01.759 him yeah but then seeing my friend's
00:17:03.399 reaction to it where I said well you
00:17:06.480 need to get involved in this I think
00:17:07.880 there's something really off with David
00:17:11.319 going on well I didn't know what was
00:17:12.760 going on I I saw Tom have an executive
00:17:16.520 role in our church which I had a problem
00:17:18.199 with because
00:17:19.559 remember uh you learned very early on
00:17:22.199 what elron Harbert says is the law
00:17:25.319 there's no
00:17:27.679 um it
00:17:29.679 it it's not up for interpretation
00:17:31.640 there's no assimilation of data it's
00:17:34.160 just what it says it's not what Joe
00:17:37.080 thinks Elon hbert said what Leah thinks
00:17:39.400 it's what it says right and that's very
00:17:42.120 strict it's always what does LR say read
00:17:44.880 it again what does it say and it's very
00:17:47.919 tough so I was very by the book person
00:17:50.799 I'm a by the book person okay if I have
00:17:53.400 a a recipe I follow it exactly I don't
00:17:55.679 do pinches I don't do that I do
00:17:57.720 exactly how it's says in the recipe and
00:18:00.400 then I see how it goes after that
00:18:02.400 Scientology is about word for word what
00:18:06.280 does it
00:18:07.600 say my understanding and the policy is
00:18:11.120 there is no
00:18:12.559 celebrity that should be treated any
00:18:14.919 differently than any parishioner and I
00:18:17.360 was seeing behavior and I was seeing
00:18:20.640 things that wouldn't be okay that are
00:18:22.640 not okay for the average parishioner but
00:18:25.159 we're being made to be okay for Tom and
00:18:28.200 it didn't matter matter to me that he
00:18:29.440 was Tom to me I saw him as a team member
00:18:32.880 in the Church of Scientology and we were
00:18:34.679 working on the same thing um I actually
00:18:37.919 thought I was a better example of
00:18:39.559 Scientology than he was and I wrote
00:18:41.120 reports on him like internal reports on
00:18:43.240 him which I didn't realize were kind of
00:18:46.400 getting me uh to be a target for the
00:18:49.000 church because I didn't realize his
00:18:50.280 position in the church you wrote
00:18:52.280 internal reports yes we're all required
00:18:55.320 to write reports on each other oh Jesus
00:18:57.679 Christ yeah there's a policy there's a
00:19:00.039 policy about writing reports so if I
00:19:02.720 let's say you and I are Scientologist
00:19:04.360 okay you and I go out one night right
00:19:06.600 like not like that Joe so don't get
00:19:08.159 right you seem
00:19:09.880 uncomfortable um you did because you
00:19:12.360 said nice as opposed to I that you said
00:19:15.360 nice I don't know if I said nice Jamie
00:19:17.600 run that back I don't I don't believe
00:19:19.159 when I okay I think I probably you look
00:19:20.919 at my sexy Nails he said they're nice
00:19:22.600 they are nice yeah they're beautiful is
00:19:24.919 that better M it's okay if you work
00:19:28.159 clone I feel like you'd have better
00:19:29.280 adjectives okay okay
00:19:32.159 um like are you a fine guy when your
00:19:34.880 wife comes out and says how do I look
00:19:36.360 Joe do you say fine no I say you look
00:19:38.799 great you say great beautiful lovely
00:19:41.799 what do you want to say lovely it's very
00:19:43.679 clinical you have kids depends on who it
00:19:45.760 comes from yeah I think different
00:19:47.760 adjectives different words have a
00:19:49.240 different meaning depending on who what
00:19:51.360 person they come from and how that
00:19:52.480 person with the intent behind it don't
00:19:54.880 you think well beautiful you look
00:19:57.039 beautiful I don't know I guess yeah I
00:19:59.320 mean evangela says I look beautiful
00:20:01.039 let's go back to the internal reports on
00:20:02.480 Tom Cruz okay sorry guys so yeah so so
00:20:05.120 let's say you go you and I went out we
00:20:06.440 were just went out one night we're going
00:20:07.960 out for dinner a group of us and
00:20:10.520 something you didn't like and I saw
00:20:12.840 you doing something that's not like for
00:20:15.640 the book I have to write a report on you
00:20:17.520 are you allowed to drink not really no
00:20:19.799 okay what if I got lit up um I probably
00:20:21.960 write a report some shots over come on
00:20:24.159  it lrh would love it I okay I's do
00:20:26.760 LR so that yes then I read a report on
00:20:29.640 you and I said Joe was acting
00:20:31.440 inappropriate he was making fun of elron
00:20:33.760 hubard cuz you're not allowed to joke
00:20:35.159 and degrade elron hubard there's a
00:20:37.120 policy called Jokers and deg graders um
00:20:39.840 Jokers Anders yes you and I would be
00:20:42.360 very much I've been yes if you've been
00:20:44.760 in trouble for that many
00:20:46.400 times um so okay so I would have to
00:20:49.640 write a report it's called writing you
00:20:51.120 up I'd have to write you up because
00:20:52.919 let's say you went into like the next
00:20:54.960 day okay for a session and you said and
00:20:57.480 they said you know they do the check
00:20:58.880 they do a check on you every
00:21:01.000 day um do you have an upset do you have
00:21:03.640 a present time problem or are you
00:21:05.600 withholding anything now if you were a
00:21:08.520 real SCI intelligence you would know
00:21:10.480 that you probably shouldn't be drinking
00:21:12.000 and carrying on because it's a 24-hour
00:21:14.320 rule you can't drink 24 hours before
00:21:17.159 you're going to be doing a
00:21:19.120 service remember you're required to go
00:21:21.320 in every day so you never can drink
00:21:24.120 right and if you do you consider it a
00:21:26.360 transgression so that's on your mind
00:21:28.600 that you're withholding this information
00:21:31.080 now if you went on a vacation and you
00:21:33.120 knew that you were going to make it up
00:21:34.520 when you got back yeah that's okay then
00:21:36.400 you can you have going CU you're not
00:21:38.799 going in that's the only time then
00:21:40.960 correct or if you're just not getting a
00:21:43.039 service but that's if you're not getting
00:21:45.120 a service correct so you'd go in and
00:21:47.440 you'd say okay so I went out last night
00:21:50.279 I ordered you know a bunch of shots and
00:21:52.559 I made a comment about to elron Hubbert
00:21:54.559 or whatever and they go okay great when
00:21:56.799 was it who'd you do it with who was
00:21:58.320 there they write down all the names it's
00:22:00.320 also being recorded um and they're
00:22:02.559 writing everything down who knew about
00:22:04.960 it will be the next question who knew
00:22:06.840 about it you'd say well Leah was there
00:22:08.559 they go Leah was there okay interesting
00:22:10.400 then that person's going to write Leah
00:22:12.159 knew about it and didn't do anything
00:22:13.760 about it then I'd get pulled in why
00:22:16.159 didn't you write a report on Joe because
00:22:18.200 Joe just admitted that he was drinking
00:22:19.960 carrying on and you didn't write him up
00:22:21.840 do you see what I'm saying so it's it
00:22:23.480 creates that kind of environment so it's
00:22:25.360 a rat environment correct so I was I was
00:22:27.840 writing up Tom and I was writing up
00:22:29.679 David mavage so what did you write up
00:22:31.120 Tom for jumping on couches and being
00:22:33.760 inappropriate I thought he was being
00:22:35.440 inappropriate what was jumping on
00:22:37.159 couches for well when you did Oprah I
00:22:39.200 thought was a bad for also wrote up John
00:22:41.640 for for the Battlefield Earth I thought
00:22:44.200 it was for the movie itself first of all
00:22:47.039 that movie was awesome it was it's a
00:22:49.720 great if you haven't seen Battlefield
00:22:50.840 Earth it's one of my favorite
00:22:52.039 unintentional don't even joke no it's
00:22:54.279 terrible but awesome because it's so
00:22:56.480 terrible ridiculous it's so terrible
00:22:58.080 becomes good it crosses over that road
00:23:00.679 it does after a while you're right it
00:23:02.240 does yes it's like uh what's that movie
00:23:04.000 with uh the dancing one with Elizabeth
00:23:06.200 Berkeley show Girls show girls that's
00:23:09.039 the best one as far as a terrible movie
00:23:11.840 that becomes awesome cuz it's so bad
00:23:13.440 you're like what in the were they
00:23:14.679 doing right and it's fantastic you're
00:23:16.720 like this is yes I get Battlefield Earth
00:23:18.279 is right up there right so I did things
00:23:20.039 like that um not that I was a great
00:23:22.080 example nor am I a great example but so
00:23:24.320 you wrote a whole thing about him
00:23:25.880 jumping up on Oprah's couch yes but I
00:23:27.559 also listen I gave myself up I you know
00:23:29.720 I was writing I was writing myself up I
00:23:31.480 was writing my mother up I was writing
00:23:32.919 my husband up he jumped up on Oprah's
00:23:34.640 couch cuz he was in love right
00:23:36.000 supposedly you know he jumped up you
00:23:37.679 know well that's what they told me they
00:23:39.320 they pulled me in and they said you know
00:23:41.080 could it be that you're just not as high
00:23:44.000 on a scale like in life like you're so
00:23:47.080 basically they were saying like you're a
00:23:48.360  so you can't understand you can't
00:23:51.200 understand that kind of love cuz I was
00:23:52.600 like right I guess cuz I've been married
00:23:54.080 20 years I don't understand jumping on a
00:23:56.159 couch um but I thought it was a it
00:23:59.720 wasn't um a good example because because
00:24:03.799 I cared so much about my church and the
00:24:05.840 work that we were doing and I didn't
00:24:07.520 want the church to be seen as a joke or
00:24:10.840 it's or one of its senior members which
00:24:12.960 he's considered a senior
00:24:14.919 Scientologist um so you just thought it
00:24:16.559 was inappropriate it was out of line so
00:24:19.120 you felt like you had an obligation
00:24:20.720 right I mean listen I'm not perfect I
00:24:23.480 mean of course there's many things that
00:24:25.480 would be considered a bad example in my
00:24:27.399 everyday I'm not a great
00:24:28.880 example um but at the time I thought I
00:24:31.320 was pretty pristine but looking at it
00:24:33.360 now you feel like it's totally innocuous
00:24:35.039 he's just on a couch jumping around
00:24:36.520 having a good time yes but if you knew
00:24:38.360 how serious Scientology was about
00:24:40.159 clearing the planet it did not go with
00:24:42.640 right our intentions and our goals um so
00:24:45.320 anyway I was writing him up and I was
00:24:46.720 writing everybody up and I was writing
00:24:48.279 everybody up at the wedding because I
00:24:49.480 thought our senior Executives were and I
00:24:51.760 was like wiring them back from Italy
00:24:53.520 from my hotel room uh calling one of my
00:24:56.080 closest friends who's a Scientologist
00:24:57.559 and I'm like and then I need you to
00:24:58.760 write this I need you to write this
00:24:59.679 verbatim I need you to write this
00:25:00.960 verbatim and I need you to get this to
00:25:02.679 the Watchdog committee and I I think I
00:25:04.399 heard you frantic frantic okay I was
00:25:08.200 frantic and I was heartbroken because
00:25:11.480 it's like
00:25:12.960 seeing if you believe that the C
00:25:16.600 organization and and the people at the
00:25:18.840 higher you know that are senior
00:25:21.480 executive strata of your church are
00:25:23.559 living a pristine and perfect life that
00:25:26.000 you're trying to Aspire to that you're
00:25:28.720 spending your day and night and money
00:25:31.919 and time like you this is what we're
00:25:34.200 trying to be and I'm seeing not great
00:25:36.159 examples of what this is now like it's
00:25:38.559 seeing behind the curtain I was like I
00:25:40.080 don't want to see this and I really
00:25:42.480 thought I was going to save the church I
00:25:43.960 thought my writing reports was like I'm
00:25:45.679 going to take over the church and I'm
00:25:47.159 going to get it right by elron Hubbert I
00:25:49.399 really still believed in the policies of
00:25:52.320 Elon Hubbert I just believe they were
00:25:53.760 bending the rules for a celebrity and I
00:25:56.679 was like he's a celebrity who gives a
00:25:58.480 what he's doing like he's a
00:25:59.600 Scientologist first and a celebrity
00:26:01.919 second to me so that's why it's
00:26:04.320 difficult I don't want to talk
00:26:05.480 about another actor because we've all
00:26:07.120 met actors and we're not
00:26:09.279 really supposed to be talking about them
00:26:12.000 do you know what I mean it's just you
00:26:13.000 don't hear that a lot you don't hear a
00:26:14.480 lot of actors doing that to other actors
00:26:16.520 but for me it was just a
00:26:18.440 Scientologist right so
00:26:20.880 you take out these reports on him I
00:26:23.520 write these reports I'm sent to um
00:26:27.120 Florida immed imately the mecca The Hub
00:26:29.720 of Scientology that's right for
00:26:33.840 interrogations no and I mean like
00:26:35.960 interrogation so you have to fly out
00:26:37.480 there I fly out there I'm uh in the room
00:26:41.760 I'm in a room you know with with cameras
00:26:44.279 with my person who is is armed with
00:26:47.480 information unbeknownst to me of a stack
00:26:51.159 of reports that were written on me by
00:26:53.520 everybody who worked for Tom a stack now
00:26:57.240 let me tell you something found out
00:26:58.640 about your report so he decided that
00:27:01.000 everyone who works for him has to take
00:27:02.480 out a report on you I don't know what he
00:27:04.159 knew but that that is that the church is
00:27:06.799 very much involved with his life he's
00:27:08.720 staffed by people who work for the
00:27:11.159 church no non- Scientologist works for
00:27:14.080 him but it was if you say something bad
00:27:17.320 about this person you were talking
00:27:19.760 about God and you and I was asked do you
00:27:23.120 have sexual intentions towards him what
00:27:25.000 are your evil intentions towards him
00:27:26.840 what are your evil intentions towards
00:27:28.399 David miscavage what are your evil
00:27:29.960 intentions towards Elon hubard and it
00:27:32.399 was 3 months of this it was and I had to
00:27:35.399 retract everything I said I said I made
00:27:37.120 it all up I didn't see any of it who to
00:27:39.159 get out of there and so then when I came
00:27:41.760 back to LA they said they want to see
00:27:44.480 you again here in Celebrity Center so I
00:27:47.039 went to Celebrity Center and they said
00:27:49.440 look everything that was done to you was
00:27:50.919 wrong I was like right I know that we
00:27:53.880 just want to let it go you need to let
00:27:55.360 it go because if the fact that you're
00:27:56.960 not letting it go means that you're
00:27:58.240 guilty of the crimes that you're saying
00:28:01.679 I'm confused they were saying that
00:28:03.200 everything was wrong that was done to
00:28:04.799 you in Florida why they that because
00:28:07.440 they wanted me to come back because I
00:28:08.799 was kind of like I'm not when I came
00:28:10.399 back from Florida I was kind of not
00:28:11.799 really a dedicated Scientologist anymore
00:28:14.760 but I wasn't doing anything to rock the
00:28:17.840 boat with my family and how long were
00:28:19.640 you in Florida for uh 3 months three
00:28:22.919 months of of of dealing with this MH
00:28:25.960 three months every day for three months
00:28:28.159 uh-huh I had to write apology letters 90
00:28:29.960 days so you're there for 90 days all
00:28:32.240 you're talking about is Tom Cruz during
00:28:34.039 my Hiatus on holy yeah yeah yeah
00:28:38.360 that's what I'm doing most of the time
00:28:39.919 and and you have a family you're married
00:28:43.159 my mother was there my my daughter was
00:28:44.799 there my husband was there and how much
00:28:46.880 the of the day are you spending on this
00:28:48.960 stuff day all day all day every day did
00:28:50.600 you see Defending Your Life no oh God
00:28:52.840 you have to see it what is it it's a
00:28:54.320 movie where um Merl stre and I forgot
00:28:56.840 the other anyway they and they go into
00:28:59.000 the you know the holding cell like you
00:29:01.200 know the where where they're going to
00:29:02.600 decide their fate are they going back to
00:29:04.480 Earth which is considered hell or are
00:29:06.919 they going on to heaven and Merl stre
00:29:09.559 lived a pristine life and they review
00:29:12.120 your life right and they have judges and
00:29:15.640 everything right so they review good
00:29:17.519 moments and bad moments of your life and
00:29:19.200 they decide are you going to go on are
00:29:21.559 you going to go back to hell and Merill
00:29:24.000 stre was of course pristine but then the
00:29:26.440 guy that I keep for I'm just say um but
00:29:29.320 you know they were looking at times
00:29:30.559 where he didn't stick up for himself or
00:29:32.399 where he pussied out or something right
00:29:34.679 and so they were judging him pretty
00:29:36.480 harshly right where they were like you
00:29:38.200 need to come back in the morning and
00:29:39.720 like it was like an old day of like
00:29:41.360 we're reviewing 120 days of your life
00:29:43.799 right right mer Street they they looked
00:29:45.519 at like 5 days and they're like don't
00:29:46.960 worry just come back when you can I was
00:29:48.880 that was me like my mother was there to
00:29:51.240 do some fluff thing and she was like oh
00:29:53.720 come have lunch with me and my person
00:29:55.320 was like be back in 10 minutes Le go get
00:29:56.919 a sandwich and eat in the elevator and
00:29:58.440 you need to be back here in 10 minutes
00:29:59.960 it was like for me it was like Defending
00:30:01.440 Your Life because my mother was just
00:30:03.480 like she had she was she didn't know
00:30:05.039 what was going on she didn't you don't
00:30:07.519 usually tell your family what you're
00:30:09.360 doing I wouldn't tell my husband what
00:30:11.080 was happening to me because I didn't
00:30:13.360 want to create can you imagine this I
00:30:15.559 did you meet your husband in Scientology
00:30:17.000 no my husband was out he was never in um
00:30:20.679 but I made him a Scientologist you made
00:30:22.679 him one I made him a Scientologist um
00:30:25.559 which was good cuz he was still kind of
00:30:26.840 cool you know what I'm saying so he
00:30:28.360 wasn't like uh he was still kind of
00:30:30.200 freaky a little bit you know still
00:30:31.960 believed in slapping an ass once in a
00:30:34.519 while uh so like I kind of got like the
00:30:37.559 good of both worlds best of both worlds
00:30:40.480 you can't slap asses if you're in s
00:30:42.480 considered abated what about choking
00:30:44.640 absolutely not it would be honestly you
00:30:48.080 would be considered like you really
00:30:50.200 there's something really wrong with you
00:30:51.720 you know okay yeah are you a slapper no
00:30:54.760 oh no I would think so you say things
00:30:56.760 like nice yeah
00:31:00.720 nice anyway so you're there for 90 days
00:31:04.200 yeah you're there 90 days and I'm not
00:31:05.880 telling my family what I'm going through
00:31:07.480 I'm not because I don't want to create a
00:31:08.880 bad situation for the church like how
00:31:10.880 crazy is that you're just like reviewing
00:31:13.399 these papers I'm admitting my crimes I'm
00:31:16.360 I'm saying maybe I do have evil and
00:31:18.480 maybe I do maybe I didn't see what I saw
00:31:21.279 you don't know these people right these
00:31:22.440 people that you're meeting with in
00:31:23.320 Florida no no they they assign you a
00:31:25.519 person you but you hadn't met them
00:31:27.200 previously no
00:31:28.480 so just some person with paperwork and
00:31:30.320 they're going over your well they have
00:31:31.799 you on the meter they have you on the
00:31:33.200 light detector test I mean on the light
00:31:35.120 you know with the can that you're
00:31:36.159 talking about yeah yeah you're in a room
00:31:38.279 that's locked and that thing doesn't do
00:31:40.000 anything right that e- meter well it
00:31:41.799 does something I don't exactly I mean
00:31:43.519 there is an actual explanation for it in
00:31:46.120 the real world not smart enough to to
00:31:48.679 retell it to you but uh if I was to have
00:31:51.679 a meter here and you had a thought I
00:31:53.720 could show you it does register that you
00:31:55.639 thought something right but you can't
00:31:57.399 really differentiate what those thoughts
00:31:59.080 are no but as an but as someone who
00:32:01.279 trains in Scientology all you're trained
00:32:03.320 to do which what I was doing I was
00:32:05.880 training to administer Scientology to
00:32:08.399 people was learning to do that and I I
00:32:11.279 would learn to say Joe what was that
00:32:13.919 thought what was that thought I don't
00:32:15.519 know what you're thinking but I just
00:32:16.639 know that you had a thought right and so
00:32:18.320 I ask you a question and then I look at
00:32:20.320 the meter to see that it registered on
00:32:22.240 the meter and regardless of what you
00:32:24.559 want to talk about we're only going to
00:32:26.120 talk about what I see on the meter right
00:32:28.600 and then there's also it's open a
00:32:30.320 suggestion right you could say is this a
00:32:32.399 moment where you had doubt is this a
00:32:33.960 moment where you were angry yes and then
00:32:35.720 the person has to think wow was it and
00:32:37.720 then they start convincing you correct
00:32:39.279 well the first thing they do is they are
00:32:41.000 you okay you need some of your
00:32:42.240 disgusting coconut war or no you like
00:32:44.360 that atrocious you loved it I didn't
00:32:46.919 love
00:32:47.679 it I also didn't love your coffee drink
00:32:50.159 but I'm sure there're sponsors I loved
00:32:51.639 everything you had Joe wait what that
00:32:53.760 this Nitro stuff you didn't like that
00:32:55.760 it's all everybody everything you drink
00:32:57.559 is cream in it there's no sugar it's
00:33:00.440 great w it's pure taste the bean you
00:33:03.559 like pure like some's
00:33:06.279 pure
00:33:08.440 so after this 90 days of being there
00:33:11.559 yeah 90 days of being stuck in this I
00:33:15.720 mean it must be like I imag I started to
00:33:18.600 believe that I was really really really
00:33:20.799 messed up I would imagine too that they
00:33:22.519 have probably a pretty Grand
00:33:24.279 establishment in Clear Water right it's
00:33:26.200 probably intimidating like that's how a
00:33:28.360 lot of like Cults and religions like to
00:33:30.960 rock it you didn't go to like a a pretty
00:33:33.159 big place it's a huge place but if
00:33:35.480 you're raised in it and you know you
00:33:37.360 you're you're very familiar with it but
00:33:39.240 it is when you realize your position in
00:33:43.039 the church takes uh a a a back seat to
00:33:48.919 the leader and Tom Cruz you realize
00:33:51.919 really that that was scary to me because
00:33:54.080 it goes against everything you've been
00:33:55.480 taught everything I've been taught
00:33:56.639 everything you've been taught is is that
00:33:58.080 everyone is some sort of a spiritual
00:33:59.559 being and everyone's equal correct and
00:34:01.840 then your whole goal as Scientologist is
00:34:04.200 act for the greater good of mankind and
00:34:06.200 and sort of bring as many people into
00:34:07.679 this as you can because you're going to
00:34:09.280 help them right because it wasn't ever
00:34:12.119 I'm going to get somebody in because I
00:34:13.480 want to screw their lives up it was
00:34:15.520 always I want to get this person in
00:34:17.520 because I want them to be happy I want
00:34:19.040 them to contribute to what we're doing
00:34:21.520 now is the the thought process that Tom
00:34:23.320 Cruz being this huge celebrity worldwide
00:34:26.800 figure that that it's very important to
00:34:29.399 keep him happy yes and he it is probably
00:34:32.359 the main goal of Scientology is to keep
00:34:34.839 tommen what a ego boost that must be for
00:34:37.359 him oh you see uh that is something that
00:34:41.079 that people say all the time to me like
00:34:43.000 why is that pot where in that ashtray uh
00:34:46.440 yeah definitely no yeah Joe do you know
00:34:48.599 that I've never smoked pot oh I should
00:34:50.199 definitely try it right now I'm scared
00:34:52.119 oh you should be why what would happen
00:34:54.079 cuz you're going to start freaking out
00:34:55.399 thinking about all sorts of stuff yeah
00:34:58.680 yeah and so you just keep it dirty like
00:35:00.520 that the ashray what do you mean why
00:35:02.160 don't you make it nice like why don't
00:35:03.480 you present it in a nice way I'm a man
00:35:05.040 and this is my man cave man don't give a
00:35:07.000  about nice really yeah well
00:35:09.320 actually I should I shouldn't act
00:35:11.040 surprised hearing what I heard before
00:35:12.680 started don't try to talk over me Joe
00:35:14.480 because you know what I'm going to say
00:35:19.320 uh you've never had pot no I would
00:35:22.359 suggest like a little tiny amount for
00:35:24.079 you like like just that's it cuz
00:35:26.680 somebody said something about gummy
00:35:28.000 bears to me about you oh Jesus don't
00:35:29.599  with those gummy bears why those
00:35:31.480 are way too powerful for now those are
00:35:33.599 horrendous so what happened anything
00:35:36.240 yeah you'll go on a journey on your life
00:35:38.680 it'll give you extreme paranoia you'll
00:35:40.720 start that's not fun it's not but when
00:35:43.079 you come out of it it's very beneficial
00:35:45.000 why because you realize it's all
00:35:46.200  and then you were nervous about
00:35:48.160 some things that it just highlights your
00:35:50.680 vulnerability oh I don't need that it
00:35:52.400 takes your blinders away I don't need
00:35:54.280 that that doesn't sound like fun well
00:35:56.560 it's not necessarily that that fun so
00:35:58.880 you would do it again or you have hot I
00:36:00.720 do it all the time I didn't say hot the
00:36:02.319 gummy bears gummy bears too I do them
00:36:03.599 all the time really so you like that
00:36:05.280 feeling of being yeah I think it's good
00:36:07.720 for you I think it's good to be
00:36:08.720 vulnerable it's good it's good to
00:36:10.440 understand it is good to be vulnerable
00:36:11.720 You're really just this finite organism
00:36:14.160 floating through Infinity you know I
00:36:15.920 think but I feel that way without it
00:36:17.920 okay well then you don't need it I mean
00:36:19.359 it's not for everybody oh wow I kind of
00:36:21.880 wanted you to push it on me a little bit
00:36:23.040 and you just gave up I think it benefits
00:36:25.119 a lot of people it makes you more
00:36:26.520 sensitive it gives you better sense of
00:36:28.079 community it makes you Kinder oh I need
00:36:30.160 I definitely need that then yeah okay it
00:36:32.079 it'll make you a more um I think it it
00:36:35.920 makes you a more loving person I really
00:36:38.359 believe that and I need it yeah okay
00:36:40.440 back to what you're saying oh makes sex
00:36:42.119 feel better makes food taste better I'm
00:36:44.079 married to a Puerto Rican so I don't
00:36:45.319 need that you
00:36:47.680 um puer Ric that was a little shout out
00:36:50.640 powerful Puerto Ricans um they do not
00:36:53.160 have sex I could tell that yeah well I
00:36:55.040 shouldn't say I shouldn't say they like
00:36:57.079 I've only had sex with one of them
00:37:01.520 um the celebrity uh we all know there's
00:37:06.119 treatment different treatment for
00:37:07.640 celebrities well especially in
00:37:09.280 Scientology right no it's highlighted it
00:37:12.400 is like nothing you could ever imagine
00:37:15.720 it is so when people say Tom doesn't
00:37:18.440 leave because they have information on
00:37:20.240 him or John that's not the reason the
00:37:22.480 amount of power they receive from this
00:37:25.200 church is like nothing in Hollywood it
00:37:28.359 is like nothing there is no reason for
00:37:31.880 them to leave this environment right so
00:37:34.119 it's super beneficial for them to be
00:37:35.599 attached to it correct he has employees
00:37:38.200 they work for him all these people will
00:37:40.040 take care of his every need yes and
00:37:42.560 there's policy on how to talk to
00:37:45.760 somebody like you wouldn't
00:37:47.920 say um like if you said go get me uh go
00:37:51.520 get me a coffee and I want at this
00:37:53.240 temperature there's no I can't get it
00:37:55.680 we're 5 miles from any you know 30 month
00:37:58.240 there would be none of that kind of talk
00:37:59.960 like not any kind there's policy about
00:38:02.640 don't you don't talk back like ever you
00:38:04.839 don't step out of line you don't give an
00:38:07.240 opinion you don't make a face you don't
00:38:09.319 make a gesture you don't sigh if you
00:38:12.319 step out of line in any way you are
00:38:16.040 dealt with by the church your expense
00:38:18.359 essentially has servants correct how
00:38:21.160 many people a lot a lot a lot and by the
00:38:24.880 way I don't begrudge somebody with a
00:38:26.359 staff like if you can have I go do it
00:38:28.280 all day all night do it all day all
00:38:30.480 night but when you believe as a
00:38:33.319 Scientologist you are working for
00:38:35.599 somebody who singlehandedly is saving
00:38:38.880 the planet and you deserve that kind of
00:38:42.720 punishment that's something different
00:38:44.680 babe you understand what like that
00:38:46.480 that's it's an abuse that is not
00:38:50.040 justified but it is Justified because
00:38:52.920 you believe that you are singlehandedly
00:38:56.280 saving the planet
00:38:59.319 kich yeah no I get it I get it so um it
00:39:02.960 so he's the main figure head right he's
00:39:05.160 the main guy like right up with Miss
00:39:06.599 cavage right and then John Travolta
00:39:08.599 somewhere in that I think John was given
00:39:12.040 What U um a designation called
00:39:15.079 kakan where Kant kakan not Kant kakan
00:39:20.040 kakan okay k h a k h a n kakan okay okay
00:39:25.839 he's given this designation of kakan
00:39:28.280 which there's a policy that basically
00:39:30.440 says you can kill another human being if
00:39:32.280 you are kakan you're going to look the
00:39:34.319 other way and he was given that he was
00:39:38.040 given that by elron H don't make me
00:39:40.200 laugh because you're going to make me
00:39:41.000 pee please don't make me laugh you're
00:39:42.440 make me pee don't laugh that you laugh
00:39:44.480 how' you work on a Comedy All Those
00:39:45.640 Years first of all not very well do you
00:39:47.680 know what takes I ruin because of like
00:39:49.640 Kevin goes don't don't ruin this
00:39:51.960 take I go no no don't tell me you're
00:39:53.119 going to do and then I would ruin it I
00:39:55.000 would ruin it Joe because he he would do
00:39:57.400 some stupid with his hands or
00:39:58.880 something that he never rehearsed that
00:40:01.160 would make me cry from
00:40:03.280 laughter yes and he was really highly
00:40:05.640 inappropriate in moments that made me
00:40:08.480 pee almost pee yeah okay so he's allowed
00:40:11.560 to kill people yeah one or you I don't
00:40:14.359 know I don't I I should look at the
00:40:15.599 policy again I don't want to uh speak
00:40:17.119 out a but you're supposed to look the
00:40:18.119 other way so like if somebody said
00:40:19.800 something wrong to John travol and pull
00:40:21.640 out a samurai sword and cut their head
00:40:23.000 off you just got to clean up the body
00:40:24.319 you just got to clean up the body
00:40:25.240 because it's called ethics protection
00:40:28.119 oh okay so everyone would be responsible
00:40:30.920 for deal with it dealing with it just
00:40:33.280 leave the room and he would know that
00:40:34.520 you guys would take care of it correct
00:40:35.760 and there's also another policy and by
00:40:37.359 the way the reason why I say these
00:40:39.240 policies is because I don't like when
00:40:41.280 people say Leah I believe you I don't
00:40:42.839 want you to believe me I want you to
00:40:44.240 look it up I want you to look for
00:40:46.119 yourself and make your own decision so I
00:40:47.760 keep quoting these policies because I
00:40:49.280 want people to look it up so that they
00:40:51.720 can say that shit's true she's not
00:40:53.480 talking you know what I mean right
00:40:55.400 um there's another policy called ethics
00:40:56.880 protection and there's another policy
00:40:58.880 called the responsibil uh the
00:41:00.640 responsibility of leaders which he
00:41:02.720 actually um says exactly what you just
00:41:05.160 said that uh basically you know what you
00:41:09.079 got to do to protect a leader you got to
00:41:10.599 do it if you see a body then you clean
00:41:12.160 it up and the leader should never know I
00:41:14.240 read going clear yeah uh by Lawrence
00:41:16.480 Wright and I watched the HBO uh special
00:41:19.520 on it and um it's it's stunning yeah
00:41:23.760 like when when crazy accurate crazy
00:41:25.680 accurate and I was B
00:41:27.880 but the book especially the book goes
00:41:29.880 into great depth about how bananas elron
00:41:33.680 hubard was right and it's just it's so
00:41:37.200 odd to me that this all this information
00:41:40.680 is out there it isn't out there though
00:41:43.440 remember you're reading alron Herbert's
00:41:45.280 words from dynetics right the book one
00:41:48.280 it is the first book that we're all
00:41:50.240 required to read everybody's required to
00:41:53.040 read uh everything that he's written I
00:41:55.400 read DX too I had it sent to me yeah I
00:41:57.400 got I I ordered it it was one of those
00:41:59.200 late night infomercial things when I
00:42:01.040 first moved to LA I I've always been
00:42:03.240 into uh self selfhelp like Anthony
00:42:06.200 Robbins I bought all his tapes I used to
00:42:08.520 listen to it on a Walkman back in the
00:42:10.480 day and read his books and I you know so
00:42:13.480 I thought it was just more of that and
00:42:15.280 uh I got put on a list and I got sent
00:42:18.599 invitation oh for years for years
00:42:20.319 invitation all of it I bet you I swear
00:42:23.280 I'm actually willing to make a money bet
00:42:25.000 that you get mail after we talk H
00:42:27.599 interesting yeah well I went to one of
00:42:29.520 those things where you sit down and you
00:42:31.440 get a e- meter and you hold the thing
00:42:33.040 and the guy asks you questions oh yeah
00:42:34.880 was in San Diego and I was filming
00:42:36.119 something oh so you saw the so they did
00:42:38.480 a demonstration did you see it read on
00:42:40.640 the meter like a thought or the pinch
00:42:42.520 did you do the pinch test well the no I
00:42:45.040 I don't remember a pinch test but I do
00:42:46.520 remember holding on to these things and
00:42:47.960 he would ask me some questions but the
00:42:49.520 guy was very uninterested he he or
00:42:52.079 disinterested he just seemed like he was
00:42:54.040 kind of like being forced to do it
00:42:55.440 that's what it seemed like to me he was
00:42:56.800 just going Through the Motions well
00:42:57.960 that's R he seems super bored oh yeah so
00:43:01.040 I wonder had he not been super bored
00:43:03.480 would you be fullon right now no no no I
00:43:05.559 was I was doing it as a goof it was only
00:43:07.400 like 10 years ago okay I thought it was
00:43:09.160 ridiculous I was in San Diego filming
00:43:11.280 something and they had this setup out
00:43:13.760 and I'm like ooo let me go in there and
00:43:15.319 I was just you know hoping I could
00:43:16.599 weasel in and have a seat and no one
00:43:18.559 would know who I am and put on the cans
00:43:20.400 and did they know no no I don't think so
00:43:22.839 the guy the guy didn't give a like
00:43:24.720 that's interesting usually they're very
00:43:26.760 you know
00:43:27.760 yeah uh welcoming and loving because
00:43:30.640 they remember they do believe in what
00:43:32.160 they're doing I did right um but anyway
00:43:34.920 what I was saying to you is the dics in
00:43:37.319 dtic you know elron harber is writing
00:43:39.880 that he's a scientist he's you know a
00:43:42.720 decorated war hero um that he was U um
00:43:47.160 college educated and so you're not
00:43:49.559 you're saying the information's out
00:43:50.920 there what information other than what
00:43:53.520 we're reading is out there well I mean
00:43:56.079 now like Lawrence
00:43:58.280 but no Scientologist allowed to read
00:44:00.079 Lawrence Wright's
00:44:01.880 book just not allowed to so they they
00:44:04.319 didn't excellent job of insulating
00:44:06.119 people look if uh you and I were like
00:44:09.319 friends friends right and you had
00:44:10.800 concern for me in Scientology and you
00:44:13.359 came to me and you said Leah I really
00:44:15.520 I'm scared for you you know I'm I read
00:44:17.440 going clear and I I want to know that
00:44:19.200 you're okay and you and Angel like I
00:44:21.280 don't know if this is a good thing for
00:44:22.319 your daughter you know I would say Joe
00:44:25.319 you know me I'm a good person like I've
00:44:27.280 been there for you you're white like
00:44:29.200 come on you know I don't I don't do draw
00:44:30.800 I don't do not you know I don't steal I
00:44:32.200 don't do right just respect the fact
00:44:34.680 that this is something I believe is
00:44:35.920 helping me why would you ask me to look
00:44:38.119 at something that's anti my church or
00:44:41.000 anti what I'm doing that's how you would
00:44:42.760 approach it but and you would accept it
00:44:44.559 Joe you'd be like she's right it is
00:44:46.480 messed up of me to be telling her these
00:44:48.960 things when she is a good person and her
00:44:50.640 and Angel are great like you wouldn't
00:44:53.200 you wouldn't push it you wouldn't push
00:44:55.079 it you would respect me enough because
00:44:57.040 she would know me enough to go I don't
00:44:59.240 want to do that to her it's wrong it's
00:45:00.720 disrespectful so you feel like that
00:45:02.119 happens pretty much across the board
00:45:04.319 well anybody who's outside yes things
00:45:07.240 yes well that's what you're trained to
00:45:08.200 do yeah so you're working constantly
00:45:10.680 with people that are not in the church
00:45:12.920 right you're on sets you're doing T show
00:45:15.160 how many people are going to come up to
00:45:16.240 you and say Hey I what I think you I
00:45:18.040 think you're an ult well in your
00:45:19.319 position very few right because you were
00:45:21.000 one of the stars of the show and
00:45:22.640 everybody kind of behind you who would
00:45:24.280 do that to Tom very few right very few
00:45:26.599 none none yeah none so when he's on a
00:45:29.559 set is it all like he's doing Mission
00:45:32.240 Impossible or something like that is it
00:45:33.640 all Scientology employees that are
00:45:35.160 constantly surrounding him yes so he's
00:45:36.960 got like this wall of insulation correct
00:45:39.119 and it's all Scientology people correct
00:45:41.280 but the director the writer the prod
00:45:43.559 they don't have to be Scientologist not
00:45:44.960 at all no no but they're not they're not
00:45:47.480 invading Tom space they're not going to
00:45:49.319 be disrespectful to their lead actor
00:45:51.240 they're not going to go up to Tom and go
00:45:53.160 hey Tom we we don't know about our
00:45:55.000 affiliation with you you know and what
00:45:57.680 you're doing in the Scientology thing
00:45:59.800 you know they're not going to rock the
00:46:01.200 boat they they hired him as an actor
00:46:03.400 right and because of the way Tom Cruz is
00:46:06.839 I me I don't know him obviously but what
00:46:08.160 I get out of him is he's a super focused
00:46:11.079 like very turned on intense guy and it
00:46:15.119 probably benefits him having all these
00:46:16.680 servants take care of all his every need
00:46:18.240 so he could focus directly on his thing
00:46:20.880 and just go for so for him it's probably
00:46:23.680 100% beneficial to be involved correct
00:46:26.480 because it is it is a world that's
00:46:28.520 tailor made to him that's so strange and
00:46:31.000 that and that is is is
00:46:33.079 Scientology uh what a rare position yes
00:46:35.960 it is for any human to ever find
00:46:37.559 themselves in without like being like
00:46:39.240 the Conqueror of a country or something
00:46:40.800 like that correct correct I mean again I
00:46:43.319 want to make the distinction between you
00:46:45.359 know listen when you gain some success
00:46:47.960 in this business thank God you're able
00:46:49.839 to surround yourself with an assistant
00:46:51.760 and people to help you to to make your
00:46:54.160 life easier so you could focus on your
00:46:55.800 work um but this is something totally
00:46:59.160 different because behind closed doors uh
00:47:02.280 you are uh acting and being a different
00:47:05.200 way and you know it I know it he knows
00:47:07.599 it and anybody in Scientology knows it
00:47:10.079 and how is he different it is uh it is
00:47:12.920 about the mission of Scientology so
00:47:14.680 anything is Justified so behind closed
00:47:17.040 doors though how is he different um it
00:47:19.960 is nothing out of line nothing
00:47:24.119 um nothing that would upset him
00:47:27.680 um you you have to act and be a certain
00:47:30.280 way around him you cannot um you just
00:47:33.960 can't step out a line out of the bounds
00:47:35.800 of the policies of the church and you or
00:47:38.680 you will be dealt with and you will be
00:47:40.119 dealt with swiftly uh within your church
00:47:43.200 and that seems um to be quite abusive to
00:47:46.599 me I was punished for uh basically
00:47:51.319 following my own policy of my church
00:47:52.960 defending my church and I I can't be
00:47:55.920 friends with somebody who who you can't
00:47:57.960 be around that you can't be around that
00:47:59.240 and You' be getting punished by your
00:48:00.559 church because of it um but that again
00:48:03.800 that wasn't really even the reason why I
00:48:05.400 left I mean I was dealing with that I
00:48:07.640 was dealing with being interrogated at
00:48:09.680 my expense we're talking hundreds of
00:48:11.359 thousands of dollars and you've given
00:48:13.000 them millions of dollars millions yes
00:48:15.160 Millions that's insane um and now they
00:48:17.319 they're they're turning around you know
00:48:19.119 they have these hate websites they
00:48:20.599 create on everybody within minutes yeah
00:48:22.800 I saw yours it's adorable is it great
00:48:25.599 yeah um they don't they can't really say
00:48:27.760 anything you didn't do anything they say
00:48:29.079 a lot
00:48:30.480 listen I said it in my book okay yeah
00:48:33.200 all those things okay you even if you
00:48:35.359 catch me you know in a situation or my
00:48:38.440 husband it wouldn't change anything
00:48:40.440 about what I'm saying it wouldn't change
00:48:42.839 a damn thing it doesn't matter their
00:48:45.200 intention is to try to you know my
00:48:47.440 husband sometimes sings in a salsa club
00:48:49.240 you don't think they're going to catch
00:48:50.280 him with a girl somewhere dancing
00:48:52.640 innocently you know what I'm saying is
00:48:54.960 yes you can do all those things you can
00:48:57.119 pis to follow us you can get us in
00:48:59.359 situations but does that change anything
00:49:01.880 they're trying to discredit you and it
00:49:03.240 doesn't matter it doesn't matter CU what
00:49:04.839 you're saying is truth exactly and it's
00:49:06.880 not just me I'm not saying it the other
00:49:09.319 thing that bothers me is that it's
00:49:10.680 become my crusade it's not my crusade
00:49:13.880 it's my
00:49:15.119 responsibility and I feel other people
00:49:18.079 need to step up and take some
00:49:20.559 responsibility I don't want to be uh the
00:49:24.200 only one saying it I don't want to be
00:49:26.400 other people other actors other uh
00:49:29.799 officials the the media uh they need to
00:49:32.839 not make it about me get some bulls and
00:49:35.040 say what you really think like I was on
00:49:36.799 2020 right with Dan Harris and it's the
00:49:39.400 parent company to A&E and I I I did the
00:49:43.799 show for somebody else and and Dan
00:49:46.559 Harris I said what do you think of that
00:49:48.240 like what do you think of Dan and he
00:49:49.720 said I have to be impartial and I said
00:49:52.319 would you be impartial about abuse are
00:49:55.480 you impartial about this and I named a
00:49:57.440 few things and he went well no and I
00:49:59.280 said right okay you're being an
00:50:02.079 and you know the truth of the matter is
00:50:04.640 I I do think that of of this industry I
00:50:07.160 think this is like a balless industry
00:50:10.079 and there's people who have some blls
00:50:12.839 like you like Adam Corolla you know
00:50:15.079 there's a few people who are in the
00:50:17.960 public eye um sorry about that who are
00:50:21.000 in the public eye that have had the
00:50:22.440 balls to have an opinion don't make it
00:50:24.400 about me right these things are screwed
00:50:27.520 these people's lives are being hurt and
00:50:29.799 damaged and you're and you're defrauding
00:50:32.000 people at a millions of dollars um by
00:50:34.720 your abusive policies you're you you
00:50:37.079 make things confidential then you say
00:50:39.119 these policies don't exist why don't you
00:50:41.040 say they exist they're you can Google
00:50:43.599 them and see that they exist well in
00:50:46.160 their defense what you are is uh a
00:50:49.079 magnet point because you are a famous
00:50:51.480 person and so it makes it much easier to
00:50:54.000 concentrate on the whole situation
00:50:57.359 through you right you know and because
00:50:59.839 of the fact that you're a famous person
00:51:01.559 because of the fact that you lived most
00:51:04.200 of your life in the church it makes it
00:51:06.559 very convenient to go through you I
00:51:08.040 don't necessarily think it's a bad thing
00:51:09.400 what they're doing in that way here's
00:51:10.680 what I'm saying if I say this connection
00:51:13.040 is a policy right right and they say and
00:51:15.400 then the next headline is Leah Remy
00:51:18.760 alleges that this connection don't I'm
00:51:20.559 not alleging anything look it up right I
00:51:23.440 see what you're saying look it up right
00:51:25.280 don't say that I'm saying it they're
00:51:26.920 protecting themselves legally probably
00:51:28.559 that's do why it's it's it's available
00:51:30.520 for anyone to see well because they
00:51:32.319 probably don't want to get sued well why
00:51:33.920 do they get sued it's in their
00:51:36.160 policies uh that's a good question and
00:51:38.400 maybe they would say that they were
00:51:39.640 misinterpreting it or interpre
00:51:42.400 disconnection and suppressives and it
00:51:44.319 says exactly what when the church labels
00:51:47.079 a suppressive person that you are only
00:51:49.760 your only option is to disconnect so you
00:51:51.960 have children disconnecting from their
00:51:54.040 own mothers and fathers that was one of
00:51:56.079 the most disturbing aspects of your show
00:51:58.240 right to see the damage that that caused
00:52:00.359 and to see how devastated these parents
00:52:02.599 were and family members were that that's
00:52:04.839 horrible that's that's really horrible
00:52:06.359 to watch and you know what people say
00:52:08.119 you knew the policy existed right when
00:52:10.799 you were in Scientology so why are you
00:52:12.359 guys so surprised we were taught a
00:52:15.119 suppressive person is like an evil with
00:52:18.559 horns they like Hitler you know that
00:52:21.160 you're not thinking it's my mother right
00:52:23.319 my daughter but when you get pulled in
00:52:27.000 for something like this which is what
00:52:28.880 they did in the end they tried to get me
00:52:30.319 to disconnect from my stepfather then
00:52:32.359 they tried to get my stepfather to
00:52:33.720 disconnect from my mother and so they
00:52:35.520 did this whole thing where your
00:52:36.640 stepfather who brought you in in the
00:52:37.799 first place no no no this is another guy
00:52:39.400 my my mother's busy she's getting crazy
00:52:41.799 yeah um yeah she's a naughty naughty um
00:52:45.040 but she's been she's been married to
00:52:46.520 George my my um her husband for 30 years
00:52:50.799 so um yeah no the other guy ended up
00:52:53.559 leaving us there he got us into
00:52:55.400 Scientology and then and he took off oh
00:52:58.520 Jesus yeah so uh talk me through your
00:53:02.040 return so you go to Florida you spend
00:53:05.240 three months getting grilled
00:53:08.079 every
00:53:09.119 day putting the pressure on you and
00:53:11.440 that's been a proven tactic of uh
00:53:13.799 interrogations that it's always
00:53:15.480 questioned by uh people that really like
00:53:19.280 look at uh the ethical implications of
00:53:22.160 interrogation the problem is when you
00:53:24.760 put so much attention on someone about a
00:53:27.000 certain thing it makes them so
00:53:28.520 uncomfortable that it changes their
00:53:30.799 perception of things to the point where
00:53:32.160 they're willing to admit a lot of things
00:53:33.640 that may or may not be true just to get
00:53:35.359 the interrogation over well that's what
00:53:36.839 I did yeah yeah I just said okay I I I'm
00:53:39.240 sorry so you come back I come back I
00:53:41.520 kind of like take a little bit of a
00:53:43.200 Hiatus from Scientology but I'm not
00:53:45.559 creating ways when you say take a Hiatus
00:53:47.480 you're not doing the daily thing anymore
00:53:49.040 I'm just not going in all the time how
00:53:50.559 often are you going in then uh um maybe
00:53:53.440 like once every month once a month
00:53:55.760 instead of every day that's a big deal
00:53:57.520 it was a big deal then they got me back
00:53:59.520 then they have a big meeting with me and
00:54:01.240 they go we want you to come back we know
00:54:03.520 you're upset like that whole thing was
00:54:05.200 just screwed up let's just come back and
00:54:06.960 I and I wanted specifics what was messed
00:54:09.760 up I want you to tell me in writing and
00:54:11.960 then you should also refund all my money
00:54:14.200 that you spent that I spent having to do
00:54:16.599 this then they showed me a policy that
00:54:18.480 there are no refunds and if I asked for
00:54:20.200 a refund then I'm going to get declared
00:54:22.400 a suppressive person and labeled an
00:54:24.640 enemy so the money that you spent going
00:54:27.000 to Florida and spending three months
00:54:28.520 down there that's what you wanted to
00:54:29.599 refund correct I want Mone the millions
00:54:31.839 that you gave them over the years no no
00:54:33.280 because listen and in in uh in their
00:54:35.640 defense I don't think it's right to get
00:54:37.280 your money back on something that you
00:54:38.640 feel you received right a service youve
00:54:40.799 received right the problem that I have
00:54:42.559 is Scientology is a pay before you go
00:54:45.119 proposition there are if not tens of
00:54:48.720 thousands of people who have money
00:54:50.359 sitting on account that they can't get
00:54:52.640 because they have a refund policy I
00:54:54.920 can't I can't just call the church right
00:54:57.000 now and say I want a refund because
00:54:58.880 they're not allowed to talk to me so
00:55:00.280 it's a catch 22 so your only person that
00:55:03.440 you could talk to in the church is the
00:55:04.880 person who deals with refunds but they
00:55:06.280 can't talk to you because you're
00:55:07.280 declared an enemy to the church so
00:55:09.480 they're
00:55:10.960 holding millions and millions of dollars
00:55:13.680 of people's money that they can't get
00:55:15.280 back because no lawyer is going to take
00:55:17.839 on the Church of Scientology for free
00:55:20.799 but you're talking the average guy who
00:55:22.760 has $50,000 $100,000 on account he or
00:55:25.880 she has never never going to see again
00:55:27.240 so you come back you you um you you get
00:55:30.960 to them they have this meeting with you
00:55:32.680 you say that you want to get your money
00:55:34.000 back they won't give you your money back
00:55:35.319 and then how does it go from there uh
00:55:37.160 they said you know you you're going to
00:55:38.680 be interrogated because you're now
00:55:41.119 acting as an enemy to the church because
00:55:43.599 you were asking for your money back
00:55:44.799 correct that's a bad sign um then I said
00:55:47.839 okay now it just kind of opened up a
00:55:50.000 little bit of a wound then I started
00:55:51.599 saying where's Shelly okay now I want to
00:55:54.200 answer where shell is cuz I had been
00:55:55.839 writing her Shelly Miss cabbage correct
00:55:58.079 the leader's wife and I said I it's it's
00:56:00.280 going to get bad for you guys because
00:56:02.400 now I started going on the internet and
00:56:04.000 I started seeing stories of senior
00:56:06.559 Executives getting beaten in the church
00:56:08.960 like Debbie Cook and Mike rinder and Tom
00:56:12.400 devot and I was seeing all these names
00:56:14.599 beaten that they were actually beaten
00:56:16.880 physically beaten um for what reason uh
00:56:19.880 for looking the wrong way at David
00:56:22.359 mavage for sighing for for sighing for
00:56:25.720 rolling their eyes for being
00:56:29.079 tired for for yawning like yawning in
00:56:31.920 front of him or something yes so someone
00:56:34.280 beats you right or or he has somebody
00:56:37.079 beat you and Mike render and Marty wrath
00:56:40.920 buun were part of that right were part
00:56:43.720 of that senior executive strata that was
00:56:45.559 up in Riverside County where they have
00:56:47.720 um a place called gold gold base and
00:56:50.880 that's where these incidents were
00:56:52.920 allegedly taking place um so I started
00:56:57.400 Googling it and I started going into the
00:56:59.359 church and saying I'm Googling this
00:57:01.079 information and I want to know why these
00:57:03.839 people are saying the same thing and
00:57:05.799 their their stories are over and over
00:57:07.599 again and then I'm seeing stories of
00:57:09.640 families being declared suppressive
00:57:12.000 people their ot8 you know they're high
00:57:14.160 up in the church and their families are
00:57:16.240 being forced and then you're be then
00:57:17.760 you're presented with um this is a lie
00:57:21.079 look Marty Mike Mike render admitted
00:57:23.920 that he beat people and Marty R I said
00:57:26.000 but that's the difference they're
00:57:27.720 admitting it they're admitting that they
00:57:30.280 did this under David mage's direction
00:57:33.720 right you're saying that they're lying
00:57:36.839 but they're not lying about they're
00:57:38.599 doing it but they're lying about having
00:57:41.280 received it does that make sense to you
00:57:43.799 I you know over and over again these
00:57:45.720 stories kept coming up and they kept
00:57:48.480 when I would ask a question they would
00:57:50.039 put me in a room and go what are your
00:57:51.480 crimes who are you talking to why are
00:57:53.039 you talking to enemies of your church
00:57:54.960 and it just it was never my questions
00:57:56.880 were never answered and I said so does
00:57:59.000 this church ever do anything wrong does
00:58:00.920 this church ever do anything wrong is
00:58:03.240 everybody an evil once they
00:58:05.920 leave is that what you're telling me so
00:58:08.240 what would happen if you said that my
00:58:10.000 mother was then I just got to believe
00:58:12.200 you that my mother is an evil person and
00:58:15.240 all these horrible things you're saying
00:58:16.839 about my mother I'm supposed to believe
00:58:18.520 you and the answer was don't believe me
00:58:21.280 believe El what does el what does el say
00:58:24.119 and then they have the policy out what
00:58:25.760 does say read this read this aloud what
00:58:28.720 don't you understand what does this word
00:58:30.599 mean what does that word mean go look
00:58:32.119 this up you have a misunderstood word
00:58:33.880 here if you don't understand that
00:58:35.640 anybody who attacks your church is a
00:58:37.960 criminal like this is the kind of thing
00:58:40.440 you go through right so this is what
00:58:42.599 you're going through when you came back
00:58:43.520 to LA when you slowly started separating
00:58:46.200 yes did they ever give you one of those
00:58:47.359 big gold medals like Tom Cruz got I
00:58:49.359 never got one but I didn't but I did get
00:58:51.839 a huge uh award for donating another
00:58:55.039 million to the
00:58:56.559 and and and it's it's so crazy to me
00:58:59.440 that everybody who leaves is somebody
00:59:01.760 who has an act to grind an apostate a
00:59:03.960 bigot because I've been called a bigot
00:59:06.400 um because they they they go to the one
00:59:08.440 place they can go to which is don't
00:59:10.839 don't um disrespect my religious beliefs
00:59:13.960 right right and then they can call you a
00:59:15.319 bigot I'm for Religious Freedom I'm for
00:59:17.160 the first amend like that that's what
00:59:18.640 they're hiding behind and I'm calling
00:59:20.079  to every celebrity who says
00:59:23.280 that because they know what they're
00:59:24.960 doing I did it too
00:59:26.760 I did it too Joe so I know what they're
00:59:28.640 doing right and they know that I know
00:59:31.400 which is even
00:59:32.559 sicker you're terrible person to have
00:59:35.160 against you on this why cuz you're so
00:59:37.160 fiery and you you you you enjoy this
00:59:40.319 this combat there's a part of you that
00:59:42.359 enjoys it clearly yeah that's what I
00:59:44.079 thought about this when the whole thing
00:59:45.480 first started going down I was like oh
00:59:47.640 she's like a terrible person to like to
00:59:49.880 leave the church cuz she's going to talk
00:59:51.240  to the end of time you're going to
00:59:53.200 go I don't mean in a bad way listen Joe

01:00:17.400 dick and I don't know about it CU I
01:00:19.000 don't listen to podcast okay but are you

01:01:13.079 restaurant I tell Angela don't speak to
01:01:14.839 me because I want to hear what's going
01:01:15.960 on next to me you know and I figure
01:01:18.319 everything out but but but if I see
01:01:21.119 people being bullied if I see people
01:01:23.559 being unjustly uh hurt
01:01:26.799 yes I do I have always said and people
01:01:28.720 who know me know that's true yeah well
01:01:31.920 so this David miscavage wife situation
01:01:35.160 did that get resolved no I filed a
01:01:37.799 missing person's uh Report with the
01:01:40.599 lepd um and then I found some pictures
01:01:43.920 of the guy who was in charge of my case
01:01:45.760 speaking at a Scientology event on human
01:01:48.319 trafficking um Lieutenant Dawson um at
01:01:51.839 the L the police officer yeah that was
01:01:53.760 in charge of the cas he was being paid
01:01:54.880 to speak at the cele Center at a human
01:01:57.200 trafficking event at Celebrity Center
01:01:59.880 Scientology that seems like a massive
01:02:02.039 conflict of interest you think okay so
01:02:04.680 then so then that's funny so then uh
01:02:08.039 after that I called uh the Dawson
01:02:11.039 Lieutenant Dawson and I said so what's
01:02:13.039 the deal because I had given a letter
01:02:16.400 with the police report that said it was
01:02:19.160 to Shell if they found her shell go with
01:02:21.880 this man now I'm going to take care of
01:02:23.720 you I'll take care of your legal fees
01:02:25.400 what's going on there is wrong you have
01:02:27.520 no idea because let me tell you
01:02:28.599 something they have no telephone they
01:02:30.440 have no mail in or out they are not
01:02:32.240 allowed to leave the base if they leave
01:02:33.880 that base up at Riverside County they
01:02:35.880 are accompanied by security or Handler
01:02:38.839 so you think she's a prisoner um I but I
01:02:42.079 if she's alive and well uh the second uh
01:02:45.680 best case scenario would be yes that
01:02:47.440 she's being held prisoner if not by her
01:02:50.319 own mind if she's alive and well so you
01:02:53.799 did what didn't she release some sort of
01:02:55.559 aate statement or someone releas some
01:02:57.440 sort of a statement someone did I don't
01:02:58.920 know who it was from to respond to your
01:03:02.000 accusations right they they said that
01:03:04.279 they had made contact with her and she
01:03:08.119 didn't want to be found I said did you
01:03:11.160 see her or was she speaking was somebody
01:03:14.319 speaking on her behalf you ready for the
01:03:16.279 answer that's classified this is what
01:03:19.200 the police said and I said are you sick
01:03:20.760 I said seriously are you sick there's
01:03:22.039 something wrong with you am I doing
01:03:23.359 something wrong I filed the report you
01:03:25.920 know that right like you know that I
01:03:27.760 filed the report I I thought maybe he
01:03:29.520 was confused and he thought he was
01:03:31.000 talking to my cousin I said no like I
01:03:33.520 filed the report of course you're going
01:03:34.799 to give me the information I need to

01:03:49.960 any of that information could you
01:03:51.920 imagine then I had to spend more money
01:03:54.119 Joe because this is not for
01:03:56.359 I had to spend more money on a lawyer to
01:03:58.520 do a followup on the public information
01:04:02.119 act I asked specific questions who did
01:04:04.760 you see did you see her was she alone
01:04:08.359 where did you see her what did she look
01:04:10.119 like they didn't give me the information
01:04:11.760 they go yeah you can get that
01:04:12.640 information you pay two $ two more
01:04:13.920 dollars okay we paid the $ two more
01:04:16.000 dollars and then the thousands of
01:04:17.559 dollars that cost me to get a lawyer to
01:04:19.119 draft up the
01:04:20.160 letter so it's still ongoing I still
01:04:22.520 don't have answers so she just sort of

01:06:21.079 ship yes and he created the ship uh
01:06:23.920 called the free winds and whatever ship
01:06:26.200 that they that's not called the free
01:06:27.240 ones it is called the free ones now but
01:06:29.000 that's where they deliver the highest
01:06:30.279 level of of Scientology there ot8 the so
01:06:33.799 when you get to OT you got to get out
01:06:36.240 but before that I don't know the name of
01:06:37.880 his votes but I think it was called the
01:06:39.440 Apollo that was a part of going clear
01:06:41.359 that was hilarious when um who was it
01:06:44.160 one of the writers or one of the the PA
01:06:46.599 haggas yes when he received like the
01:06:49.839 highest level that wasn't even the

01:13:10.719 food chain yeah not only is my mother
01:13:12.840 top of the food chain when it comes to
01:13:14.199 the counseling side my mother was top of
01:13:16.520 the food chain when it came to
01:13:17.800 administering Scientology which is very
01:13:19.679 rare she was what's considered a high
01:13:22.159 trained auditor but she hadn't read this
01:13:24.360 stuff yet of course read it she was just
01:13:25.760 there to see my excitement oh I see okay
01:13:27.880 she was just there as a spectator to see
01:13:29.480 her daughter received the answers right
01:13:32.400 but you were super skeptical
01:13:37.040 Fu right supervisor comes over and he
01:13:39.239 goes what don't you understand I go I
01:13:40.840 understand it I just I don't I don't
01:13:42.320 loved it like I'm not happy I go I just
01:13:44.840 got to tell you I'm not happy with this
01:13:46.320 is what it was and he goes well you
01:13:48.520 don't need to believe it you just need
01:13:50.000 to do it so that's the answer that's
01:13:52.679 given to you you don't need to believe
01:13:54.320 it you just need to do it so then you
01:13:56.600 have to go and audit this you have to go
01:13:59.719 and do it on yourself talk to these
01:14:02.840 beings on the meter by yourself so uh on
01:14:06.840 the meter meaning you hold the cans and
01:14:09.120 when I say cans folks what they look
01:14:10.800 like it looks like Soup cans like if you
01:14:12.960 drained all the soup from a soup can and
01:14:15.040 it had a string attached to it it's
01:14:16.520 connected to some yeah you could just
01:14:17.960 Google what Scientology eer e- meter
01:14:20.400 okay so so you have to hold the e- meter
01:14:23.000 and discuss this no you think it you
01:14:25.280 think it you know there's think so now
01:14:27.000 you got to go get your material so after
01:14:28.600 you've been checked out on this and they
01:14:30.280 get that you get what it is then you go
01:14:32.159 back to the window and they give you
01:14:34.040 your actual what you're supposed to do
01:14:37.400 with this information so it'll say like
01:14:40.360 it'll be a piece of paper and it'll say
01:14:42.880 ask this question and then look at the
01:14:45.840 meter and what the answer is whatever
01:14:47.639 answer comes to your mind write it down
01:14:50.120 huh do you see what I'm saying yes so
01:14:51.679 all you're doing is Awakening these
01:14:53.920 things to talk to them them really yeah
01:14:57.600 right and to let them go you're
01:14:58.960 basically saying like go be free go so
01:15:00.920 this is ot3 correct and by the way when
01:15:03.960 I was a Scientologist and I heard that
01:15:05.800 this was a story I I didn't know so I
01:15:08.800 would go to the internet and go ot3
01:15:10.639 story but I didn't know what if it was
01:15:13.120 true so I couldn't verify it right do
01:15:15.000 you see what I'm saying so most people
01:15:16.120 who go that's because they
01:15:18.400 haven't they don't know what they're
01:15:19.840 looking at on the internet right there's
01:15:21.679 no one to verify it with so if I went to
01:15:23.520 my mother let's say before I got to this
01:15:26.159 level they you're you're told to lie to
01:15:28.199 people you can't tell people what the
01:15:30.480 answers are cuz they're going to get
01:15:32.000 pneumonia they get pneumonia literally
01:15:34.239 will die okay so so a lot of times when
01:15:36.520 I lied to the press and then they
01:15:37.800 confronted me on it and said why'd you
01:15:39.280 lie I was like I had to to save your
01:15:41.080 life I mean I can't I don't want to give
01:15:43.760 you cancer so if you were about to go to
01:15:47.120 ot3 and then you went online and you
01:15:49.600 investigated what is ot3 and then you
01:15:51.520 read a bunch of stuff about these little
01:15:52.760 beings in your body and then asked your
01:15:54.360 mom your mom would have to lie to you
01:15:56.120 she would lie to me as she did as she
01:15:58.280 did so after you got through this what
01:16:00.840 made you do four and five cuz there's
01:16:03.600 always the carrot of like just wait it
01:16:06.199 just by the way here's what they do they
01:16:08.480 set up that you're the auditor now so
01:16:10.600 you're you're auditing these things in
01:16:12.960 your body you're now the boss so they go
01:16:15.560 they tell you get your hat on like
01:16:17.280 you're it's your job you don't need to
01:16:19.560 believe anything you just need to audit
01:16:22.679 them so you need to do your job as an
01:16:25.000 auditor that's what they're called
01:16:26.280 Auditors people who are the ones who
01:16:28.560 take you into session and Scientology
01:16:30.560 right so you feel like you're in a
01:16:32.560 leadership role so you're doing these
01:16:34.080 things a favor you know and you're like
01:16:36.159 well maybe it's true I don't know I mean
01:16:37.600 I do sometimes Hear Voices you know like
01:16:39.840 you know you have a moment with yourself
01:16:41.480 and you're like I might be really kind
01:16:42.719 of crazy um so you're like maybe this is
01:16:45.679 an answer it's it's sick because it
01:16:47.920 speaks to a side of you that wants
01:16:50.560 answers about life you know and then
01:16:52.520 you're like no this is some crazy
01:16:54.400 man there wasn't even the people what no
01:16:58.840 you know it it listen you believe what
01:17:01.320 you want to believe at the time right
01:17:03.239 soes does it feel to you at the moment
01:17:05.080 like maybe if you just keep going all
01:17:07.960 the pieces will fall into place then
01:17:09.239 it'll make sense like I'm confused now
01:17:11.400 but if I contemplate this and I really
01:17:13.000 think it over eventually I'm going to
01:17:15.320 receive enough information where this is
01:17:17.000 all going to be like oh I was a fool I
01:17:20.159 didn't understand right so for example
01:17:22.679 one time I had talked to a friend about
01:17:24.280 it I said you know I heard something
01:17:26.239 about some zenu
01:17:29.040 she Zen she pulled me into
01:17:31.760 celebrity center so fast into a secured
01:17:34.239 room and she handed me my ass she said
01:17:37.360 don't you ever say that word outside a
01:17:40.400 secured room I'm writing a knowledge
01:17:42.080 report on you she said I'm writing a
01:17:43.360 report on you I swear to God you never
01:17:45.800 say that word out loud in a room that's
01:17:49.000 not secured okay and never say it again
01:17:51.560 so she wrote a report on me knowledge
01:17:53.080 report she wrote a knowledge report on
01:17:54.320 me I got sent to what's called ethics
01:17:56.199 which is like the justice department of
01:17:58.159 celebrities of of Scientology and they
01:18:01.199 said they brought me into another
01:18:02.880 secured room because they have to get
01:18:04.159 somebody who knows this information and
01:18:06.280 they said never ever say that say this
01:18:09.760 never confirm it never deny it never
01:18:12.360 give that information out ever just
01:18:14.639 never discuss it just say I've never
01:18:16.120 heard of it you sound crazy wow and
01:18:18.520 that's what we all say you sound crazy
01:18:20.520 or you know properly done you get it you
01:18:23.920 know like you'll get it if it's properly
01:18:25.920 done those people didn't do it properly
01:18:27.560 that's why they didn't understand it do
01:18:29.040 you see what I'm saying there's a
01:18:31.199 there's a line that you cross right
01:18:32.960 we're like this is my life this is
01:18:35.159 Scientology this is what I believe and
01:18:36.960 then you cross this line oh my God this
01:18:39.400 is right that that's a that
01:18:43.440 line that bridge that you cross in your
01:18:45.880 mind is a very distinct transition so
01:18:49.840 what what was that like like what is
01:18:52.320 that transition like like what is what
01:18:55.800 is your life like hard well now once you
01:18:58.760 did how long ago did you to leave July
01:19:01.440 will be four years that's it yeah that's
01:19:03.679 not long no that's really recent Joe and
01:19:06.840 I'm
01:19:07.719 still you know finding myself I'm still
01:19:11.360 like who am I what do I believe right
01:19:13.960 you know am I some am I a
01:19:16.920 person that like you're saying loves a
01:19:18.360 fight cuz I don't want that I don't want
01:19:19.840 to be that person who loves to fight
01:19:21.639 just to fight I want to be on the path
01:19:24.239 of of being righteous I want to be who I
01:19:28.040 really am and and and who I really am is
01:19:31.239 sometimes an Joe sometimes I am
01:19:33.679 I have a horrible temper I'm like a
01:19:36.880 sometimes I feel like I'm an old school
01:19:38.760 Mafia person stuck in a female like I I
01:19:41.239 have really extreme thoughts about life
01:19:44.360 and I'm finding who I am I'm finding out
01:19:46.719 what I really believe because a lot of
01:19:48.120 times I don't know I go do I believe in
01:19:49.880 that don't I believe in that I was
01:19:51.400 taught that everybody smokes pot is evil
01:19:53.400 do I believe that everybody who cheats
01:19:54.920 is evil and horrible and just lost do I
01:19:57.760 believe that other religions are lost do
01:19:59.520 I believe that everybody needs like I
01:20:01.560 really I'm searching you have to
01:20:02.920 re-evaluate your entire belief system
01:20:04.639 now everything and it was a big part of
01:20:06.440 my day remember it gave me a mission it
01:20:08.960 gave me purpose and and that's what I
01:20:12.000 hear a lot from scientologists is ex
01:20:14.719 scientologists not just hearing their
01:20:16.400 pain of losing their families and
01:20:17.840 everything they've ever known but not
01:20:20.280 having purpose right when you wake up
01:20:22.880 every morning like you know we have
01:20:24.880 purpose Joe we have kids thank God for
01:20:27.080 them but this was so much bigger it was
01:20:31.400 for your children's children that's a
01:20:33.120 giant factor for people I have some
01:20:35.199 friends that were deeply involved in the
01:20:36.920 Mormon religion and uh they're not
01:20:38.920 anymore and it was really weird because
01:20:40.679 we went to dinner once and uh they were
01:20:43.760 saying do you believe in a higher power
01:20:46.199 and uh I said it's entirely possible I
01:20:48.679 said I don't but I don't believe in
01:20:49.760 anything that I don't have any evidence
01:20:51.560 of right it's entirely possible like I
01:20:53.600 think the universe is an incredible
01:20:55.560 mystery and I think the life itself in
01:20:58.000 Consciousness is an amazing mystery and
01:21:00.760 I don't think we have all the answers I
01:21:02.159 don't I just think I don't think an aunt
01:21:04.000 can understand a cell phone and I don't
01:21:05.840 think I can understand the Universe I
01:21:07.560 just think my brain is not evolved
01:21:09.560 enough I don't think our our our
01:21:11.639 understanding has reached the point
01:21:13.280 where we could really accurately
01:21:14.600 describe what this is all about and they
01:21:17.080 and but their their answer was like how
01:21:19.000 do you get up in the morning right I go
01:21:20.639 I love life I go I like I like drinking
01:21:23.480 nice wine I like having dinner I like
01:21:25.239 being with my friends I like uh Joe not
01:21:27.600 everybody has that well they probably
01:21:30.320 should find some things they enjoy about
01:21:32.000 this life exactly but that's the thing
01:21:33.600 is finding those things for
01:21:35.880 Scientologist it's like a lot of my
01:21:38.920 friends like who didn't really know what
01:21:40.719 I was going through in the church go you
01:21:41.760 know you're very kind of childish at
01:21:43.560 times you know because I never went to
01:21:46.040 dinner in my 30s and 40s and had wine
01:21:50.199 like I wouldn't go to dinner and have
01:21:51.639 wine I'd get reports written on me you
01:21:54.120 know we we had to go to church the next
01:21:56.280 day I wasn't going out to dinner after
01:21:58.080 the King of Queens and enjoying my
01:22:00.880 friends if and if I did Joe I was
01:22:02.760 thinking they're lost they need
01:22:04.480 Scientology you know I was never really
01:22:06.760 there I was never really part of uh I'm
01:22:09.560 like living for the first time but I do
01:22:11.639 have faith that's the one thing that I
01:22:15.080 have found and not in a weird way not in
01:22:18.199 a I'm in another cult way not in just I
01:22:21.040 have faith for the first time I don't
01:22:23.639 believe in any one thing I believe in a
01:22:26.520 higher power and I believe that Faith
01:22:30.040 having faith is a big thing these people
01:22:32.719 that I was friends with I'm still
01:22:33.880 friends with this this conversation got
01:22:36.520 it got a little weird that night but it
01:22:38.040 got way weirder years later because they
01:22:39.920 wound up leaving what do you mean they
01:22:41.320 left the Mormon Church okay why did that
01:22:43.320 get weird well because then they got
01:22:44.960 they became untethered and uh the
01:22:46.920 conversation I had with uh the wife was
01:22:49.000 very strange because she was like I grew
01:22:51.520 up in indoctrinated in this fun alist
01:22:54.920 religion and she goes and now that I'm
01:22:56.639 not in it she goes I don't know what to
01:22:58.840 believe and I realize that my mindset is
01:23:00.960 kind of up because I I'm
01:23:03.639 indoctrinated like my brain developed as
01:23:06.199 a young age believing nonsense and never
01:23:09.159 questioning it she goes so I feel very
01:23:11.040 vulnerable very susceptible she goes I
01:23:12.960 feel like if the right cult came along
01:23:14.679 they could scoop me up and she was
01:23:16.000 laughing about it but she wasn't
01:23:17.639 laughing about well here's the thing I'm
01:23:18.719 the opposite now that's why like when I
01:23:21.120 I I don't want you to tell me nothing I
01:23:23.639 don't want to be told a damn thing I've
01:23:26.360 been told my whole life what to do and
01:23:28.760 how to think so I've gone the opposite
01:23:30.800 just don't tell me what I need to do and
01:23:34.080 it it the pendulum swing is far you know
01:23:37.480 I mean like even going to the DMV when
01:23:39.280 they go you need to stand there I don't
01:23:40.400 need to stand anywhere like I don't need
01:23:42.560 guess what I don't need my license
01:23:43.920 renewed and then and then I'm that
01:23:45.480 person I will destroy my whole day and
01:23:48.159 get a ticket because I don't want to be
01:23:49.760 told what to do don't talk to me like
01:23:52.199 I'm you know your child and don't talk
01:23:54.719 to me certain like you know I'm very
01:23:56.159 much that way you know you should have
01:23:57.800 shorter nail I don't give a what
01:23:59.480 you think about my nails I want them
01:24:02.239 that they're slightly longer than
01:24:03.880 average because it's purposeful and when
01:24:07.159 I don't want them anymore I won't have
01:24:09.159 them but I that's just a small scale but
01:24:11.480 I don't want people telling me what I
01:24:13.880 should think anymore and how let me find
01:24:16.760 my way I'm going to make mistakes I but
01:24:19.360 I want to find my own way so you're sort
01:24:21.480 of reestablishing your own personal
01:24:23.040 sovereignty and I don't know what it is
01:24:24.679 Joe I'm like I said I'm going to piss
01:24:26.159 some more people off I'm sure and I'm
01:24:28.560 going to make a lot of mistakes I'm
01:24:30.120 going to not be the perfect person
01:24:31.800 people think I am or want me to be but I
01:24:34.639 got to make mistakes you got that's how
01:24:36.080 you learn I I wasn't able to learn right
01:24:39.480 it was like that do it this way this the
01:24:41.440 way we do it we don't do this we don't
01:24:43.040 do that I mean I was always a little bit
01:24:45.159 of of a rebel in but I thought everybody
01:24:47.719 was being held to this higher standard
01:24:49.520 they weren't I was finding out other
01:24:51.400 celebrities were smoking pot and then
01:24:53.840 going into the sauna yeah exactly like
01:24:56.520 doing their purification rundown a 100
01:24:58.679 times that because that's when that's in
01:25:01.199 the beginning steps of scient you have
01:25:02.639 to do what's called a purification
01:25:04.000 rundown it's supposed to uh detox your
01:25:07.199 body of all you know uh Tans not fans
01:25:10.800 you're not there yet no no Joe you don't
01:25:14.560 get to say that I don't get to say it no
01:25:17.239 baby until you get there oh when do you
01:25:19.159 get there what you you have to spend
01:25:21.840 $380,000 and and about 40 Years of your
01:25:24.119 life 40 yeah that's a lot of work it's a
01:25:26.520 lot of work um no you you learn uh
01:25:29.480 basically purification rundown is just
01:25:31.119 you're supposed to sweat out all of the
01:25:32.920 toxins lodged in your fatty tissue now
01:25:37.239 the problem with that is um you're
01:25:39.440 taking large amounts of niin and they
01:25:42.040 claim you're you're you're running out
01:25:44.600 like uh
01:25:46.159 suntan from from when you were a kid and
01:25:48.560 from other lifetimes and it's really n
01:25:52.639 yes flash ni you feel it in your skin
01:25:55.639 get you hot yes and you have to sit in
01:25:57.040 the sauna for 5 hours it's a 5 hour
01:25:59.800 thing but I was finding out I was like
01:26:01.800 wait a minute why was that person even
01:26:03.040 smoking pot we're not to smoke pot right
01:26:05.159 like I haven't been smoking pot this
01:26:06.480 whole time you know where people do and
01:26:09.639 I'm learning that other people were
01:26:10.960 smoking pot doing other drugs and then
01:26:12.760 going in the sa I was like wait I didn't
01:26:14.280 know there was an option for me like I
01:26:16.119 was living by this you know what I mean
01:26:18.400 so that's what I'm going through now I'm
01:26:20.000 not saying I'm smoking pot but you you
01:26:22.320 want to a little bit um
01:26:25.159 only because I want to be calmer but uh
01:26:27.400 it might not make you Cal adds to okay
01:26:29.159 then I don't want it well it could it it
01:26:31.480 has a different effect on everybody I
01:26:32.840 I'm too old for that no you're
01:26:33.840 definitely not Joe I'm too old for it no
01:26:35.920 you're not no you're alive if you're
01:26:37.840 alive you can experience the benefits of
01:26:39.760 a Consciousness enhancing substance
01:26:41.600 whether it's mushrooms or pot or
01:26:43.520 anything Jo that's crazy it's not crazy
01:26:46.440 it's not
01:26:47.719 crazy I don't know I look at me I'm like
01:26:50.239 getting yeah you're freaking out you've
01:26:52.480 been in a cult your whole life sorry
01:26:54.199 sorry
01:26:55.679 folks okay nobody in Scientology other
01:26:58.760 than the people are going to attack me
01:26:59.880 and you are are listening to this well
01:27:02.360 even the people that are going to attack
01:27:03.679 you and me that I don't I feel bad for
01:27:05.679 them I feel bad for them I feel bad for
01:27:07.520 anybody that wants to attack anybody for
01:27:08.880 their beliefs or for talking about stuff
01:27:11.040 and guess what if your religion or your
01:27:13.840 belief system is so easily destroyed
01:27:16.480 that someone can have a disparaging
01:27:17.920 opinion about it and that that threatens
01:27:20.600 you to the point where you want to
01:27:21.600 attack that person you're doing
01:27:23.280 something wrong you're leading your life
01:27:25.480 wrong you're on the wrong path there's a
01:27:27.880 lot of people that have different
01:27:29.080 opinions about a lot of different things
01:27:30.960 and it's one of the more interesting
01:27:32.000 things about life like you don't like
01:27:33.920 coconut water I love coconut
01:27:35.880 water we're allowed to you don't you you
01:27:38.320 like cologne I think it smells like
01:27:40.800 we're allowed to have different opinions
01:27:42.480 this is one of the beautiful things
01:27:43.639 about life people like different kinds
01:27:45.280 of music different styles of art they
01:27:47.840 like different kinds of houses and
01:27:49.639 different Landscapes it's it's one of
01:27:51.280 the things that makes people interesting
01:27:52.880 right so the problem with any kind of
01:27:55.960 ideology the pro the problem with what
01:27:58.760 what this represents or any other kind
01:28:00.520 of cult or any other kind of really
01:28:03.960 rigid structure is that it's human
01:28:07.239 beings are very susceptible to those
01:28:09.280 kind of routines we're very susceptible
01:28:11.520 to influence we're very susceptible to
01:28:14.560 other people carving out these
01:28:16.560 predetermined patterns of behavior that
01:28:18.320 you just quickly slot into because it
01:28:20.719 keeps you from having to form your own
01:28:22.199 opinions and that's that's everything
01:28:24.719 that's wrong and you truly believe that
01:28:26.520 you believe it yeah I'm sure and you do
01:28:28.560 believe it you do I mean it's very easy
01:28:30.800 for people to just slot themselves into
01:28:32.920 these these patterns right and adopt
01:28:35.360 those opinions as their own instead of
01:28:37.040 trying to formulate their own because
01:28:38.239 it's very complicated to try to
01:28:39.360 formulate your own opinions and they
01:28:41.280 have to be flexible because new
01:28:42.639 information comes up and then you have
01:28:44.360 to kind of change them and adjust them
01:28:46.000 and then recognize that perhaps like
01:28:48.159 like you're recognizing right now that
01:28:49.639 like wow I've like kind of like I've
01:28:51.600 lived a lie for like a long period of
01:28:53.800 time I mean it it doesn't discredit you
01:28:56.639 as a human it doesn't I mean and it's
01:28:59.119 very brave of you to discuss that openly
01:29:01.639 because it gives people that are
01:29:02.679 listening to this that the same sort of
01:29:05.719 understanding of these thoughts that are
01:29:07.080 in their own mind whether it's because
01:29:08.639 of whatever religion fill in the blank
01:29:11.360 and that's the other thing about this
01:29:12.520 how the do they have tax tax exempt
01:29:15.360 status well because they they're first
01:29:18.320 of all the IRS they answered the IRS
01:29:20.400 questions uh to to get that status and
01:29:23.600 one one of them is do you have any other
01:29:25.600 affiliation with any other God um of
01:29:28.440 which they said no they deal with they
01:29:30.400 they they believe that they are
01:29:32.199 Spiritual Beings and they they deal with
01:29:34.080 the spirit right um and so they answered
01:29:37.800 the questions that needed to be answered
01:29:39.119 for the IRS but is it isn't it amazing
01:29:41.199 that any religion gets C tax exempt
01:29:43.360 status like um all of them are
01:29:45.560 ridiculous well I I don't want to make a
01:29:48.360 comment about other like Bonafide
01:29:50.920 religions because I I don't like you
01:29:52.560 think some of them are Bonafide well
01:29:54.760 yes I do and I'm going tell you why I
01:29:57.159 mean honestly Joe you have to really
01:29:59.679 make the distinction between an
01:30:02.199 organization that takes your mind
01:30:04.840 hostage from the minute you walk in and
01:30:07.560 that you are you are required to be
01:30:10.400 there 20 you know 2 and a half hours a
01:30:12.840 day that your eternity is at stake that
01:30:15.360 you the planet every man woman and child
01:30:17.480 on this planet their lives are at stake
01:30:19.920 with what we do in Scientology don't you
01:30:22.560 think the people who are like hard
01:30:24.719 fundamentalist Christians believe that
01:30:26.440 you said fundamentalists okay so I'm not
01:30:28.560 talking about that what I'm talking
01:30:30.000 about are what what I witnessed as a
01:30:33.080 child with my grandmother my grandmother
01:30:35.320 lived down the street from her church we
01:30:37.840 would walk in on the way to get you know
01:30:39.960 sausage and meatballs and things she
01:30:41.760 needed to make her sauce and she'd go in
01:30:44.320 and light a candle for her friend Connie
01:30:46.600 or she'd go in and light a candle
01:30:48.199 because I lost my ring or she'd pray to
01:30:51.520 this saint or that Saint and when I was
01:30:53.239 scared at night night she would say pray
01:30:57.320 to this person pray to you know do your
01:31:00.119 cross and God's going to protect you
01:31:01.760 when you sleep and here's your angel and
01:31:04.920 you know here's your little C you know
01:31:06.960 she would give me little um you know the
01:31:09.560 Saints on the on the necklaces and stuff
01:31:12.119 and she'd say and I believed for that
01:31:14.600 night that that Saint was protecting me
01:31:16.560 or that God was protecting me and and
01:31:19.159 those moment Comfort it gave me Comfort
01:31:21.360 and so that's what I tell my daughter I
01:31:22.760 don't want you to believe in anything
01:31:23.960 thing although I did bapt baptize her as
01:31:26.480 a Catholic I said I want you to really
01:31:29.920 find your way with some kind of
01:31:31.960 spirituality but I'm going to baptize
01:31:33.880 you Catholic because I feel you need
01:31:35.560 some kind of foundation but I don't want
01:31:37.119 you to be forced to believe in anything
01:31:39.520 but I want you to believe in something
01:31:41.119 or you're going to fall for anything and
01:31:43.560 I didn't have structure as a child you
01:31:46.000 know I had
01:31:47.000 Scientology and I that's a structure
01:31:49.239 right well I mean a real a real
01:31:53.199 religious
01:31:54.480 base a real religious base correct have
01:31:57.280 you ever heard the difference between a
01:31:58.199 cult and religion this is a beautiful
01:31:59.760 quote what is it a cult is it's
01:32:01.639 created by one person that person knows
01:32:03.360 it's in a religion that guy's
01:32:05.800 dead
01:32:07.840 right did you come up with that no seems
01:32:10.920 very joish no it's it's just something I
01:32:14.000 read yeah I like it but it's true so I I
01:32:17.119 but so that was my experience of
01:32:18.679 religion now I know people feel very
01:32:20.360 differently about religion being forced
01:32:22.000 down their throat but I would have kind
01:32:24.360 of loved you know going with my family
01:32:27.080 every Sunday to church I I think it it
01:32:29.880 created when I saw my father doing that
01:32:32.280 with his other daughters I was a little
01:32:34.280 bit jealous that we didn't have that
01:32:36.400 right that we didn't get Easter dresses
01:32:38.280 and it wasn't a big thing cuz my you
01:32:40.320 know we didn't have that growing up it
01:32:41.639 gives you comfort right yes and so
01:32:43.600 that's also the
01:32:46.480 the um I'm trying
01:32:49.080 to look it doesn't cost a quarter of a
01:32:52.920 million you know to to get up to this
01:32:54.880 level that I explained to you and by the
01:32:56.840 end of it if you have made millions that
01:32:59.880 you're going to give those Millions away
01:33:02.280 um it is a requirement that's not a
01:33:04.960 requirement in in other religions um
01:33:08.719 that you are not allowed to talk to
01:33:10.920 certain people that now I understand
01:33:12.960 there are other
01:33:14.880 Cults that do that and I and I do call
01:33:18.080 those things a cult because I don't
01:33:19.560 think any organization any church should
01:33:22.199 tell people who they can and cannot talk
01:33:24.719 to what they can and cannot read what
01:33:27.320 they should and shouldn't do the person
01:33:29.560 should make their own decisions based on
01:33:32.360 the information that's given to them or
01:33:34.480 information that they find on their own
01:33:36.960 right it's very different this is a pay
01:33:39.080 before you go proposition there are
01:33:41.639 repercussions to leaving nobody knows
01:33:44.119 that I went in and out of a Catholic
01:33:46.320 Church the other day and lit a
01:33:48.480 candle nobody's calling me saying where
01:33:50.960 are you why you're not here who you
01:33:52.600 talking to you need to come in or we're
01:33:54.360 going to start working on your family
01:33:55.719 destroying your family do you who does
01:33:57.760 that I understand what you're saying but
01:33:59.360 you know there's there's different
01:34:01.480 styles of behavior patterns that exist
01:34:05.679 in all sorts of religions like Buddhism
01:34:07.480 is radically different than Islam you
01:34:09.440 know and there's different requirements
01:34:10.800 that they ask of the people and a lot of
01:34:13.159 it is based on the environment that
01:34:15.239 these religions were established in
01:34:17.159 based on how long these things have gone
01:34:19.400 on for whether or not the uh the people
01:34:22.360 that are a part of of that religion have
01:34:24.520 gone through the enlightenment like what
01:34:26.239 what different factors played a part and
01:34:28.600 what standards they uphold today and
01:34:30.239 what make people but the my issue is
01:34:33.520 always with subscribing to predetermined
01:34:37.000 patterns of behavior and ideologies
01:34:39.239 where where they indoctrinate you on
01:34:40.719 specific ways to think and and that's
01:34:42.880 what this is yeah that's what a lot of
01:34:44.239 religions are I mean it's it's it's a
01:34:45.960 real issue with with human beings well
01:34:48.520 my grandmother uh of course was was
01:34:54.199 yes exactly raised to think a certain
01:34:55.960 way about people or lifestyle and uh but
01:35:00.320 she had the choice to be friends with
01:35:03.960 somebody who maybe wasn't those things a
01:35:06.600 choice we don't have a choice no it's
01:35:08.760 it's pretty obvious that some especially
01:35:11.199 in particular the way you're describing
01:35:12.800 Scientology it's far more suppressive
01:35:14.920 than most and far more rigid in its
01:35:17.320 Behavior patterns right and they they
01:35:19.159 force you into these Behavior patterns
01:35:20.800 and it's it's incredibly difficult to
01:35:22.679 break Behavior patterns
01:35:24.280 espe when you fir your this is the right
01:35:27.840 way to be yeah yeah it's Justified
01:35:30.159 because you're clearing the planet it's
01:35:31.440 just amazing that they don't have to pay
01:35:32.880 taxes that's like stunning if you look
01:35:35.360 at their their Doctrine if you look at
01:35:37.320 all that's the thing the where there
01:35:40.199 have been judges that should have looked
01:35:42.040 into the doctrine they said it's not we
01:35:43.840 canot we cannot actually look into the
01:35:45.960 doctrine um but they need to understand
01:35:48.119 that there you need to look into the
01:35:49.600 doctrine where it's abusive and hurting
01:35:51.600 people yeah if your Doctrine calls for
01:35:54.000 you to hurt people hurt children uh the
01:35:56.600 government does need to step in you're
01:35:58.920 right I agree well it just for
01:36:02.040 absolutely this the accusations about
01:36:04.119 the SE org and about people making 15
01:36:06.000 bucks a week and about these people that
01:36:07.480 are essentially working as that's not
01:36:09.159 illegal in dentur service but that's not
01:36:10.719 that's not illegal they sign up for it
01:36:12.639 so as long as you sign up for it and
01:36:14.040 sign that billion dollar contract you're
01:36:16.080 not subject to any minimum wage laws or
01:36:18.679 anything along those lines no and by the
01:36:20.560 way Joe I'm not really that smart enough
01:36:21.840 to speak on these things because people
01:36:23.800 think that my that my agenda is to uh
01:36:27.320 take away their tax uh exempt status uh
01:36:30.560 I would love for that to happen but
01:36:31.840 that's not the reason for the show the
01:36:33.199 reason you just want to express yourself
01:36:34.560 and be honest about your experiences and
01:36:36.440 help other people not my experien these
01:36:38.400 are other people's experiences but yours
01:36:40.520 too well but because I know it's true
01:36:43.040 because I experienced it um I'm
01:36:45.320 co-signing and I'm saying you know if
01:36:47.320 you're going to bully somebody bully me
01:36:49.119 bully A&E but I'm going to let these
01:36:51.480 people tell their stories because
01:36:52.679 they're telling the truth right yeah and
01:36:54.840 if we weren't telling the truth you
01:36:55.960 would have sued us so cut the
01:36:57.840 already well that's what's interesting
01:36:59.080 is the the disclaimer the end of your
01:37:01.239 episode the end of our episode it's in a
01:37:02.880 hundred times yeah yeah it's
01:37:06.199 but they got to do it I understand think
01:37:07.639 it's smart it's smart to do it you know
01:37:09.119 it's a lot to me it's annoying every
01:37:11.040 time I see it I roll my eyes I mean
01:37:12.639 every time I see it I go I understand it
01:37:15.440 but you know it's it it's annoying
01:37:17.880 because what we're saying is true mhm
01:37:20.520 again this is a litigious group okay
01:37:22.639 they're not going to shy away away from
01:37:23.840 any lawsuit if they could have sued us
01:37:25.800 or they would have but they know what
01:37:27.480 we're saying is true these are the
01:37:29.560 policies of the church here's the thing
01:37:31.119 Joe they what they should do is go yeah
01:37:33.400 we subscribe to these policies you don't
01:37:35.400  like it don't be part of our
01:37:37.000 church but don't say we're all lying
01:37:39.719 right it's right there on the internet
01:37:41.000 you I had the books in my
01:37:42.560 freaking
01:37:43.520 garage right what are you yawning about
01:37:46.159 no not yawning at all I feel like you
01:37:47.560 are no no no I'm just thinking now your
01:37:50.960 your your your current state right now
01:37:53.280 like doing the show and uh having all
01:37:55.880 these people I feel like you're helping
01:37:57.480 a lot of them for sure cuz you're you're
01:37:59.239 you're you're getting their message out
01:38:00.679 there and again it's a very
01:38:01.639 heartbreaking message when you see these
01:38:03.520 people and they're not in contact with
01:38:05.040 their children and they're not in
01:38:06.159 contact with loved ones yeah I couldn't
01:38:08.119 imagine my daughter doing those videos
01:38:11.000 going my mother just wants to make a
01:38:12.920 book my I'm disgusted by my mother I'm
01:38:16.080 disgusted that she that that she's my
01:38:18.239 mother I would
01:38:20.560 be devastated it's czy and I'm I'm one
01:38:23.239 of those lucky ones you know like these
01:38:25.920 things didn't happen to me Joe I wasn't
01:38:28.360 I wasn't molested I wasn't hurt I wasn't
01:38:31.560 physically hurt I wasn't um my kids
01:38:34.679 didn't disconnect from me my mother
01:38:36.440 didn't disconnect from me I have my
01:38:38.040 mother during the holidays I have my
01:38:39.960 sisters I have my husband now your life
01:38:44.800 must have revolved around the church in
01:38:47.080 a very big way socially yeah what is
01:38:49.920 that like now like all those people
01:38:51.800 they've written you off right
01:38:54.040 yeah um it's sad I'm sad for them
01:38:56.760 because our relationship was was
01:38:58.760 obviously um dependent on my
01:39:01.280 relationship to the Church of
01:39:02.639 Scientology you can understand that
01:39:04.239 right from them being brainwashed and no
01:39:08.520 because they knew me right so for my
01:39:11.199 church to say you Le is an enemy of our
01:39:13.520 church my friend should have said
01:39:15.159  well aren't you kind of an
01:39:16.760 enemy of them now though uh I don't know
01:39:19.040 why I would be they know we're telling
01:39:20.480 the truth right but that truth is very
01:39:22.639 damaging to
01:39:24.480 daming policies of the church right
01:39:26.719 you're right no I'm I'm not saying you
01:39:28.199 say anything WR stand behind it say you
01:39:29.840 don't like it don't be part of it yeah
01:39:31.760 but they can't really do that right
01:39:33.480 because they're doing some up
01:39:35.199 things baby they say they're the epitome
01:39:37.480 of morality they're the the the elite of
01:39:40.040 mankind they're saving the planet so
01:39:44.040 when you go on their website and see
01:39:46.080 that they say that they largest growing
01:39:47.880 religion they are the only ones with the
01:39:50.199 solution to life to man's ills I'm not
01:39:53.719 making this up okay so when you make
01:39:56.119 those kinds of claims you then then
01:39:59.639 stand behind it say that's right that's
01:40:01.480 right we don't believe in other things
01:40:02.960 we don't we think you're all lost we are
01:40:05.880 extremists we are bigots and we this is
01:40:08.719 what these are our believes then don't
01:40:10.239 join us we obviously have enough money
01:40:12.119 do you communicate with any of the
01:40:13.599 people they're not allowed to talk to me
01:40:15.400 of fact I've seen celebrities who talk
01:40:17.159  to me on Twitter and social media
01:40:18.960 not directly at me and they run from me
01:40:22.040 they run from me at parties and they're
01:40:24.119 lucky they're lucky that they run
01:40:26.159 because honestly I don't mind I don't
01:40:28.679 mind you talking just when you see
01:40:30.760 me back it up that's all just back it up
01:40:33.040 when you I don't want to name you want

01:43:45.760 something that I always wanted to do as
01:43:49.040 far as helping people this is why I was
01:43:51.040 in Scientology I love loved helping
01:43:53.960 people it was everything to me if
01:43:56.239 somebody needed help I was there I just
01:43:59.119 love it um that's why I know like to
01:44:02.159 talk about these people I know in
01:44:04.400 their hearts they really believe they're
01:44:05.920 helping even attacking me is helping so
01:44:09.239 I don't really want to call these people
01:44:11.880 out like this specific person but but at
01:44:14.199 least have the balls to back it up when
01:44:17.080 you see me so you believe they had just
01:44:19.080 have misguided intentions but their
01:44:21.080 intentions are correct as you did at one
01:44:22.880 point
01:44:23.920 you're qualified I would call anybody a
01:44:26.360 liar a bigot I would tell the Zen story
01:44:29.280 as a lie it's crazy you sound crazy what
01:44:31.719 is the Zen story this is this story This
01:44:34.159 Is How They got to be attached to our
01:44:37.239 bodies the zenu story is they got
01:44:39.840 packaged what is it you can Google they
01:44:41.679 fell into a volcano got dropped into a
01:44:43.960 volcano or something they got yes they
01:44:45.639 got package like there was a planet that
01:44:47.599 existed like this it looked like this
01:44:50.440 and then the the the the um Lord zenu
01:44:54.880 thought that there was too many people
01:44:56.639 on the planet so he packaged all these
01:44:58.560 people up is that ot8 stuff no I think
01:45:01.480 this is ot3 stuff ot3 and what what
01:45:03.679 happens like at ot8 did your mom's out
01:45:06.239 now right hold on yes so hold on so you
01:45:09.080 are told from the very beginning in
01:45:10.400 Scientology that you have a reactive
01:45:12.480 mind and so in Dione XS you are running
01:45:16.119 out these bad experiences that you've
01:45:18.320 had maybe this lifetime maybe last
01:45:20.080 lifetime maybe lifetimes ago so you're
01:45:23.040 you're told that you have a reactive
01:45:24.440 mind and we're gonna take it away we're
01:45:26.239 gonna find it and we're gonna take it
01:45:27.920 away so you don't even know that you
01:45:29.000 have it until you're told you have it
01:45:30.599 right so you run all these like things
01:45:33.119 these incidents like you'll get a
01:45:35.360 picture in your head oh I'm getting a
01:45:36.840 picture that I was like a
01:45:38.520 French all Medieval Times whatever
01:45:41.480 they're like that's okay you don't have
01:45:42.840 to believe it just say it just say what
01:45:44.440 it is yes and then I was burned at the
01:45:46.960 steak I was a witch I obviously I was in
01:45:49.000 Salem and I wasn because I have a
01:45:50.719 problem with fire you know and you're
01:45:52.520 making up these things as you go and
01:45:54.159 then you're like I think I'm making
01:45:55.199 these up and then there's a policy that
01:45:56.719 says the person's going to say by El
01:45:58.199 harber that they're making it up but
01:45:59.760 they're not making it up these are real
01:46:01.280 pictures of real past lives right MH
01:46:05.080 okay by the time you get to otaa you're
01:46:07.960 told okay so what wasn't true all of
01:46:11.639 that was a lie you made that
01:46:13.880 up but what is like what aren't you so
01:46:18.159 I'm not a I'm not a body I'm not a arm
01:46:22.199 I'm not a this I'm not I was never Louis
01:46:25.520 the the I was never that guy that I said
01:46:27.800 I was never uh a witch in Salem I was
01:46:30.719 never so that's what ot8 is that you're
01:46:33.239 basically told what what wasn't true
01:46:35.760 what are you like what are you really
01:46:38.040 I'm just me is the answer how did your
01:46:40.199 mom get out my mom got off that ship and
01:46:42.880 she said I'm never going back doing
01:46:46.719 another thing cuz she thought it was
01:46:48.000  but she thought it was okay
01:46:49.960 when you were going through your ot3
01:46:51.520 thing and they're explaining to you that
01:46:52.960 covered with bugs you're not ready
01:46:55.400 you're not not bugs baby what didn't you
01:46:57.760 understand do we need to go
01:46:59.800 back baby do we need to do no no we
01:47:02.280 don't but I'm I'm laughing I'm just
01:47:03.920 joking around um little beings be not
01:47:07.000 bugs like you and I just without a body
01:47:09.360 yeah okay um we're so your mom got all
01:47:12.239 the way past that yes and something she
01:47:15.920 decided at one point time it's
01:47:18.119 it wasn't for me what was it that she
01:47:19.719 decided she couldn't tell me that if she
01:47:22.320 would have told me that that would have
01:47:24.080 stopped me from going they would have
01:47:26.080 pulled me in immediately so when did she
01:47:27.520 think it was I know T8 oh so
01:47:30.280 she got to the top but she can't tell me
01:47:32.360 she thinks it's I'm still
01:47:33.800 coming up behind her if I that if she
01:47:37.920 then pulled me in and said Leah this is
01:47:39.920  like I I don't want you to
01:47:41.719 continue then I would have turned her in
01:47:44.400 I would have oh you know what I'm saying
01:47:46.639 it would have it they would have gone to
01:47:48.239 work on me and your mother you need to
01:47:49.960 disconnect from your mother she didn't
01:47:51.719 want me to disconnect from her that's so
01:47:53.920 comp want to lose her family so you
01:47:56.760 learn to be
01:47:58.159 quiet it's so complicated it is
01:48:01.280 complicated and it takes years and years
01:48:03.239 of this you don't just it doesn't happen
01:48:05.560 overnight so your mom got to otaa so she
01:48:08.280 had to go to the ship yeah and is it the
01:48:10.639 wackiest of the wacky when she got to
01:48:12.440 there and she's like this is nonsense
01:48:13.960 I'm done she was just happy to be done
01:48:15.760 finally it was almost like she was free
01:48:18.159 wow yeah so what happens when she left
01:48:20.599 did they go hey where you going no no no
01:48:22.280 she you know after you're done they let
01:48:24.080 you off the ship right you complete it
01:48:26.080 you get
01:48:27.000 aert and that's it you and then you
01:48:29.000 don't have to go every day anymore no
01:48:30.480 and now but they created more OT levels
01:48:32.599 now so she would have been called back
01:48:34.199 in they created more so you get to eight
01:48:37.159 you're like look we just went to the
01:48:38.560 Vault we uncovered a scroll right we
01:48:41.480 found some writings of elron hubard
01:48:43.800 before he
01:48:44.960 passed and I swear to God it's not even
01:48:47.560 a lie and you believe it Joe don't laugh
01:48:49.560 at me because I feel bad for like I feel
01:48:52.239 bad for people I do looking back I go
01:48:55.560 you know we were all went into it like
01:48:57.520 with a good heart like we
01:49:00.119 believed what they were saying it was
01:49:02.360 like what what do you mean you just
01:49:03.760 found it Elon Hubbert said it was the
01:49:05.360 end of the bridge was ot8 and we spent
01:49:08.159 our whole life doing this like you want
01:49:09.880 there to be a definite end you know so
01:49:11.760 you could live your life a little bit
01:49:13.760 it's just incredible that a science
01:49:14.960 fiction writer could create something
01:49:17.280 like this that's so poorly written
01:49:19.840 poorly thought out we only knew of his
01:49:21.880 science fiction writing like from him
01:49:23.560 telling us but it wasn't like we were F
01:49:25.239 like knew Elon hubard as a science
01:49:27.000 fiction writer but there must be some
01:49:28.440 knowledge of it otherwise Battlefield
01:49:29.719 Earth would have been made of course
01:49:31.000 they have a whole building on on uh they
01:49:32.920 have a whole literary building on
01:49:34.719 Hollywood Boulevard called Arthur
01:49:37.239 services and it's all dedicated to Elon
01:49:40.000 Hubbard's
01:49:41.080 publishing um and you walk in you think
01:49:43.599 this man is a serious writer like this
01:49:46.920 is somebody who was really well
01:49:48.360 accomplished in this world for people
01:49:49.440 who don't know he wrote more books and
01:49:51.360 wrote more stuff than more fiction than
01:49:54.400 any human being that's ever lived ever
01:49:56.520 is that true yes he wrote more fiction
01:49:58.960 than anyone who has ever walked the face
01:50:01.199 of the plan do say something about his
01:50:03.400 abilities made up more than anyone
01:50:07.040 who ever lived so he wrote down more
01:50:09.960  that never really happened than
01:50:12.040 anyone who ever lived right but the
01:50:14.719 Scientology stuff he was telling the
01:50:15.960 truth about
01:50:17.480 right but you don't make that you don't
01:50:19.679 think that you know understand you don't
01:50:20.880 make that distinction you don't you
01:50:22.719 you're reading dynetics cuz it's a
01:50:24.000 self-help book like you were searching
01:50:26.199 for something bigger you know most
01:50:28.880 people are looking for that and so when
01:50:31.800 you read that book and you're like oh I
01:50:33.480 could cure myself of psychosomatic ills
01:50:35.800 and right um well he it's that was big
01:50:38.800 part of going clear is that it he it it
01:50:41.360 seems pretty obvious that he was going
01:50:42.840 through some issues himself and he was
01:50:44.560 trying to self- diagnose cured himself
01:50:46.880 of blindness he said so and and you
01:50:49.360 believe it you want to believe it Jo you
01:50:51.520 want to believe like I can cure myself
01:50:53.520 of things I I am the cause of my own um
01:50:57.840 well-being by my own thoughts and I
01:50:59.920 don't want this reactive mind and and
01:51:02.320 you know that makes sense right when
01:51:03.719 people say have you ever done anything
01:51:06.320 that uh is uncontrollable to you that
01:51:08.599 you know it's damaging to you and you're
01:51:10.119 like yeah every day I don't want to make
01:51:12.000 bad decisions well that's because it's
01:51:13.360 your reactive mind right it's it's
01:51:15.800 beneath you it's it's it's it's in your
01:51:17.800 subconscious deep in your subconscious
01:51:19.800 and we're going to help you find those
01:51:22.040 um areas is and we're going to help you
01:51:23.560 to stop making bad decisions and who
01:51:26.800 doesn't want that right and you believe
01:51:29.000 it you know you go from maybe you know
01:51:32.079 uh punching somebody in the face you
01:51:34.040 know for looking at you a certain way to
01:51:35.880 being able to control your emotions
01:51:37.560 you're like oh okay maybe this working
01:51:39.000 oh okay I used to do drugs now I don't
01:51:41.520 you know in kiry's case it saved her
01:51:43.400 life so if she believes that it saved
01:51:46.440 your life it saved your life I'm not
01:51:48.159 taking that away from her I'm not taking
01:51:50.280 away your gains and your wins but don't
01:51:53.040 take away the fact that you know I'm
01:51:54.880 telling the truth and don't come from me
01:51:56.800 when you know I'm telling the truth
01:51:58.000 because then we do have a
01:51:59.679 problem it seems like yeah I mean
01:52:02.199 they're a clan you know and you are
01:52:04.520 opposing the clan you know but they know
01:52:06.840 it's true so I have a listen if you
01:52:09.079 didn't know was true then i' like oh
01:52:10.480 she's unaware she knows it's true so to
01:52:12.520 come from me is kind of crazy it is kind
01:52:15.079 of crazy right like what what is the
01:52:16.920 predominant criticism amongst these
01:52:18.599 people they're not they can't say you're
01:52:19.880 lying right uh yes they say I'm lying
01:52:23.000 we're all lying baby not just me we're
01:52:24.840 all lying any person who's spoken out
01:52:27.239 out against the church is lying we are
01:52:30.480 bigots we are um
01:52:33.079 invalidating their religious beliefs we
01:52:36.360 are um telling them that something
01:52:39.119 didn't help them we're not nobody's
01:52:40.599 saying that nobody if you feel you've
01:52:42.440 been helped you've been helped however
01:52:44.920 you know the truth and now you have a
01:52:47.960 responsibility but what they think is I
01:52:50.520 don't want to have a problem Scientology
01:52:52.199 help me and so that's all I care about
01:52:54.119 so you don't give a about abuses
01:52:56.040 you don't care that children were being
01:52:57.639 molested and these things were being
01:52:59.920 hidden you don't care that people
01:53:01.719 children being molested honey if you
01:53:03.239 even just Google that what I just said
01:53:04.840 Scientology and child mol you will get
01:53:06.960 come upon website after website of of
01:53:09.079 people saying I was molested while I was
01:53:10.960 in the church and the church did nothing
01:53:12.840 about it I'm not alleging it this is
01:53:15.960 what I've read this is what I've seen
01:53:18.079 right um and I've been in I had I hadn't
01:53:21.199 heard that before you you you can hear
01:53:23.719 it you're going to hear it because
01:53:24.920 people are becoming more and more vocal
01:53:27.079 about what's happened to them and so if
01:53:29.599 I seem uh overly passionate about this
01:53:34.719 subject it's because I have heard these
01:53:37.320 stories over and over again behind the
01:53:39.880 scenes I have heard stories of people
01:53:41.800 being abused children being abused
01:53:44.040 mentally physically
01:53:45.679 sexually and I'm only me with a show you
01:53:49.679 know A&E can't do anything other than
01:53:51.920 just let me tell these stories um so I'm
01:53:55.520 virtually um and and Mike rinder and um
01:53:59.599 other avenues that we we really can't
01:54:01.560 talk about I'm trying to do something
01:54:03.520 right by these people and so the last
01:54:05.760 thing that I want to be bothered with is
01:54:07.639  from a celebrity who knows that
01:54:11.639 um we're telling the truth about what we
01:54:13.280 have already spoken about but to be
01:54:15.679 interested enough to maybe find out what
01:54:17.840 I am talking about now right well the
01:54:21.119 Gran sstan one is is really odd cuz
01:54:23.239 she's a news person she's supposed to be
01:54:26.320 uh a television news journalist right I
01:54:28.760 mean isn't that what she does I don't
01:54:30.040 know um yes but why what why is it
01:54:33.520 because I would just assume like you
01:54:35.520 would want your news from someone who
01:54:37.360 doesn't believe a bunch of wacky
01:54:39.719 well then I'm in her defense I mean who
01:54:42.760 who knows what any uh person believes
01:54:46.119 true um however the distinction that I'm
01:54:50.280 glad you did make is when you are here
01:54:52.400 hear in about abuses when you are
01:54:54.360 hearing about things that are happening
01:54:56.000 that are hurting people you then do need
01:54:58.760 to say I'm aligned with this
01:55:00.360 organization and so I do need to find
01:55:02.119 out right how long has she been in it I
01:55:04.199 think most of her life there's a lot of
01:55:06.239 people like that right get indoctrinated
01:55:07.800 as a child yes have you received emails
01:55:10.920 or any sort of uh contact from people
01:55:13.960 who your show benefited and it it was
01:55:15.920 the Catalyst for them leaving a lot no
01:55:18.760 for leaving no I have uh we've received
01:55:22.520 tons of emails of people who said I'm
01:55:24.480 glad you told me that I'm glad I watched
01:55:26.599 your show I am well informed now I will
01:55:28.880 never step into a church of
01:55:31.840 Scientology um what about people leaving
01:55:34.960 because of it well you're not getting
01:55:36.639 Scientologist watching the show right no
01:55:40.400 they have shows right they do have TV
01:55:42.280 you don't have to be on the front well
01:55:43.880 average scientologists do but they're
01:55:45.719 not watching shows like this they'd have
01:55:47.560 to pay for that literally Joe like you'd
01:55:49.880 have to go in the next day and pay to
01:55:51.520 have your own inter ation and Punishment
01:55:53.679 handed to you for watching a show like
01:55:55.280 ours or going clear after a while you
01:55:58.199 just go I don't want the punishment
01:56:00.199 especially if you believe that I am the
01:56:03.679 devil if you believe that I am a liar
01:56:06.679 that I have crossed over to another side
01:56:09.560 that I'm not to be listened to why would
01:56:11.199 would you support somebody who was
01:56:12.400 talking about you and your faith or
01:56:15.520 your family and people you love would
01:56:17.079 you go out of your way to listen to them
01:56:18.520 maybe but the average person doesn't
01:56:20.880 want to seek out things
01:56:22.880 that they think are damaging to them
01:56:25.360 what now what kind of blowback have you
01:56:26.880 received from this like and what kind of
01:56:28.480 blowback is a guy like Paul haggus or
01:56:30.880 Lawrence Wright or any of these people
01:56:32.360 well Paul had to watch his family go on
01:56:34.520 his Heat website that the the Church of
01:56:36.320 Scientology created and watch his family
01:56:39.040 talk about him um disconnect because
01:56:41.560 they're still in it because they're
01:56:42.719 still in it disconnect from him as every
01:56:45.280 single person who's been on the show um
01:56:48.079 they've been followed they've been
01:56:49.400 harassed they've been uh they got piis
01:56:51.599 following them they have people showing
01:56:53.040 up at their jobs uh they're getting
01:56:55.599 mailed all like people who are people
01:56:58.840 who don't even have never stepped into a
01:57:01.800 church of getting male connected to me
01:57:04.280 male at their house I mean like have
01:57:07.000 never stepped into a church of
01:57:08.320 Scientology the girl does my eyebrows
01:57:10.880 she's like I don't know I said you You'
01:57:13.239 never stepped into a church she said
01:57:14.760 never she's getting male for the first
01:57:16.840 time for the Church of Scientology it's
01:57:18.320 just crazy but that that that's just a
01:57:20.800 little um uh OTE but that but to have
01:57:25.119 your family make videos of you to not
01:57:28.199 talk to you to refuse to see you your
01:57:31.719 their own
01:57:32.960 grandchildren um that that's just
01:57:35.239 something I can't deal with but also now
01:57:38.719 what we're what I'm dealing with now is
01:57:41.560 hearing
01:57:43.079 stories uh of these people who've been
01:57:45.079 silenced for years the pain that they've
01:57:48.040 they've had to deal with and sustain
01:57:50.320 through these years the fact that their
01:57:51.560 normal in any way is a miracle um and so
01:57:55.719 I I hope to do something with them and I
01:57:57.599 hope to to make some change what what
01:58:00.280 are the positive aspects of Scientology
01:58:03.880 and how do you think it benefited you
01:58:05.639 and do you think it's possible to take
01:58:07.880 some of those positive aspects and
01:58:10.920 either reform that organization or form
01:58:14.239 another organization that doesn't try to
01:58:16.440 control people's thinking but maybe
01:58:18.199 positive maybe tries to encourage the
01:58:21.239 the positive benefit benefits of being a
01:58:23.079 part of a group I couldn't promote
01:58:25.119 anything good about it because I know
01:58:26.320 it's an all-in proposition right but
01:58:28.280 isn't it but isn't there some read read
01:58:31.719 books you can always buy the books if
01:58:33.360 you want to buy the books but I I mean I
01:58:34.920 don't think it there's I you know I'm
01:58:36.960 going to a therapist now and I bring up
01:58:38.639 Concepts and she's like oh yeah that was
01:58:40.040 in Psychology my uh psych one you know
01:58:42.400 I'm like what right A lot of it is from
01:58:44.480 that a lot of from this existed yeah you
01:58:47.199 know um so yeah but I I believe in in uh
01:58:51.040 um finding things that work for you I
01:58:52.599 don't think it's one thing the one thing
01:58:54.480 that my therapist teaching me is that
01:58:56.400 it's not just one thing you know you get
01:58:58.679 something from here you get something
01:58:59.880 from there it's knowledges Scientology
01:59:02.320 is not about knowledges it's about us
01:59:04.719 and this therapy thing is very new to
01:59:06.639 you you never went through any fact my
01:59:08.560 first thing that I said to her is I just
01:59:09.880 want you to know that I think I know
01:59:10.960 more than you I was taught I was taught
01:59:13.159 as a Scientologist that you are you have
01:59:15.520 wasted your life going to college uh I
01:59:18.480 could do for a person in five minutes on
01:59:20.520 this e- meter what you're going to with
01:59:22.440 me in you know in 5 years like I what
01:59:26.199 did your therapist say I understand I
01:59:29.040 understand I understand that you feel
01:59:30.639 that way and she said uh you know that
01:59:33.719 um spirituality and religion uh should
01:59:36.760 have nothing to do with the
01:59:38.719 ego but like it that stayed with me for
01:59:41.320 a second because I was like I have a
01:59:42.599 huge ego she's right she's right
01:59:44.840 Scientologist believe that they have the
01:59:47.840 answers and when you believe that you
01:59:49.920 have shut yourself off to to uh the
01:59:53.159 fruits of observation to experiencing
01:59:55.679 other people to opening your heart up to
01:59:58.920 things I mean it's it shuts you off
02:00:01.520 completely so you feel like this is a
02:00:03.040 part of you that you're re-exploring or
02:00:05.840 exploring maybe for the first time non
02:00:08.119 colog thing is like I'm so judgy about
02:00:10.400 it but I'm willing to maybe change my
02:00:13.000 mind my non- colog thing I'm sure you've
02:00:16.159 seen that video of Tom Cruz the where
02:00:19.119 it's got the mission impossible sort of
02:00:20.719 soundtrack playing in the background he
02:00:22.199 talking about a car accident if you
02:00:23.840 stumbled upon a car accident like you
02:00:26.040 know that you are the one who has to
02:00:27.840 take care of it because you're a
02:00:28.880 Scientologist you're the only one who
02:00:30.239 can handle that and and you believe that
02:00:32.000 when you're a scient you you are not
02:00:33.760 only you are taught that we are the only
02:00:36.360 ones doing anything that you are the
02:00:38.119 only ones that's why it was so shocking
02:00:40.199 to me when no one in my church was
02:00:41.760 willing to stand with me I was like wow
02:00:43.639 so we are not those people who stand up
02:00:46.320 right we we are the people who look the
02:00:47.800 other way because you're all looking the
02:00:49.679 other way because of time because of d m
02:00:52.360 scavage because you have no Bulls really
02:00:55.679 are we those people because the truth of
02:00:57.880 the matter is when there was an accident
02:00:59.280 Joe I did stop I am that person that
02:01:01.880 stops and say are you so that's one of
02:01:03.480 the positive benefits of Scientology you
02:01:05.599 feel you're well you feel that you're
02:01:07.119 responsible for everything and you felt
02:01:09.119 like you wanted help as well you felt
02:01:11.199 you could help and you wanted to help
02:01:12.719 that's a positive thing right you're
02:01:14.079 right and all scientologists do think
02:01:15.679 they're helping right so there's got to
02:01:17.280 be
02:01:18.119 some like one of the thing that I've
02:01:20.000 found about a lot of scientologists ego
02:01:22.719 Jo if you think you're the only one
02:01:24.760 doing anything by the way there are
02:01:26.960 other people who stopped but I believe
02:01:29.079 in my I believed that it was because I
02:01:31.639 was a Scientologist that I stopped right
02:01:34.239 but then I saw in life I was like wait a
02:01:36.119 minute there's good people in the world
02:01:37.560 they have no interest no ulterior motive
02:01:41.199 no vested interest in helping somebody
02:01:45.079 right they're like I'm almost shocked
02:01:47.920 like with the show that's why like in in
02:01:49.639 the last episode I was in tears I was a
02:01:51.440 mess because I was shocked by the
02:01:53.719 goodness of people that I thought the
02:01:56.079 world was so
02:01:58.000 screwed because of Scientology because I
02:02:01.320 thought we were the only good people in
02:02:02.840 the world do you see what I'm saying
02:02:05.079 sounds so stupid and juvenile it doesn't
02:02:07.800 though it completely makes sense and and
02:02:10.400 honestly from someone who's lived their
02:02:12.960 entire life indoctrinated in that
02:02:16.119 ideology and you've only been out for
02:02:17.520 four years you're you're showing a
02:02:20.159 remarkable amount of self- insight and a
02:02:23.760 remarkable amount of ability to examine
02:02:28.599 the flaws of your past thinking and
02:02:31.320 current yeah and current yeah because
02:02:33.560 every day I'm like that's really messed
02:02:35.000 up Le but to abandon the foundation that
02:02:37.880 you've kind of established your entire
02:02:39.280 life on it's got to be insanely
02:02:40.960 difficult and to do it in your 40s after
02:02:42.480 all these years of being involved in
02:02:44.239 this crazy sort of organization it's
02:02:47.599 very it's very admirable it's very hard
02:02:50.199 it' be way easier for you to just keep
02:02:52.520 stay in stay inside your comfort zone
02:02:55.560 keep doing all your nonsense get up to
02:02:57.639 OT 55 or whatever the it is now you
02:03:00.480 know and just uh keep paying the money
02:03:02.760 and keep your friends right you know do
02:03:04.760 you miss any of your friends that were
02:03:06.119 in it
02:03:08.159 um no I only miss um the children
02:03:13.280 of um like my goddaughter and you know
02:03:17.119 cuz I see her she lives in my
02:03:18.199 neighborhood and she can't talk to you
02:03:20.239 well her mother can't talk to me she
02:03:21.800 doesn't know me now I delivered her you
02:03:25.360 know delivered her in the hospital and
02:03:28.280 then I move we moved my friend close to
02:03:31.920 me down the street so she could be in a
02:03:33.840 certain school district and then I'd be
02:03:35.960 able to be my goddaughter and uh I see
02:03:39.360 her in the neighborhood and she can't
02:03:41.360 talk to me so the girl the you know that
02:03:45.000 my God doter doesn't know me she
02:03:46.480 wouldn't know to come to me because
02:03:48.880 she's now only you know five you know
02:03:52.000 what I'm saying right um how are they
02:03:55.840 hanging on how do they how how do they
02:03:58.199 stay they have amassed three billion
02:03:59.960 dollar in assets three billion mhm yes
02:04:03.960 and so it takes it's going to take a few
02:04:05.800 good men and women to stand up with us
02:04:09.440 and and and get interested you know like
02:04:11.520 I said there's been a few public figures
02:04:13.559 to to publicly come out you're now one
02:04:16.400 of them Conan is another one and and you
02:04:19.239 know Bill Mah like there's some people
02:04:20.840 with some Bulls that are willing to say
02:04:22.800 this is and we should be doing
02:04:24.840 something about it um The World At Large
02:04:27.559 is supportive of of me and the people
02:04:30.520 who are contributing to the show
02:04:32.320 amazingly supportive social media has
02:04:34.639 been amazing to us um and and as well
02:04:38.000 Ane very brave to do a show like this
02:04:40.040 this is the first time of its kind I
02:04:42.199 mean a series about it um took some
02:04:45.040 balls in their part um they it out
02:04:48.400 with disclaimers but okay I think they
02:04:50.400 probably had to do that for their lawy
02:04:51.760 you don't need to defend
02:04:53.420 [Laughter]
02:04:55.599 them um so I think more and more people
02:04:58.679 are coming out more and more people are
02:05:00.440 being supportive but we need more people
02:05:02.360 in the public eye to say that's this is
02:05:04.360 enough we need to do something what has
02:05:05.920 it been like doing press for this and
02:05:07.920 promoting it like what have been the the
02:05:10.280 varied reactions from people that you've
02:05:11.920 had to talk to it's varied it's not been
02:05:13.800 varied it's been very
02:05:16.199 supportive and Beyond Touch by it like
02:05:19.040 Beyond I didn't know what I was going to
02:05:20.800 get I didn't know know if I was going to
02:05:23.040 get people who were going to you know
02:05:25.559 kind of Walk the Line and go well I
02:05:27.000 don't know you know I mean the one
02:05:29.559 problem I had was with Dan because I
02:05:31.320 felt you know Dan knew enough Dan was
02:05:33.679 provided with enough we've talked to him
02:05:35.360 enough Dan Harris you know from
02:05:38.639 20 like he was like kind of I was like
02:05:41.639 we can't be impartial about things we
02:05:43.119 shouldn't be impartial about like come
02:05:44.599 on there's certain things in the world
02:05:46.040 you need to stand up to right and I want
02:05:48.679 people to feel that power whether it's
02:05:50.760 this cult or other Cults or um um a
02:05:55.000 political party or agenda like I feel
02:05:57.559 people have the power to do something I
02:05:59.239 think that's becoming more and more
02:06:01.159 evident um and I think people need to
02:06:03.480 start standing up for what they believe
02:06:05.000 in they can do something and we get
02:06:07.119 asked that all the time like what can I
02:06:08.440 do I say call your Congressman call them
02:06:10.480 and say I want you to look into this I
02:06:12.840 want you to do something about this if
02:06:14.320 you're a lawyer who could do something
02:06:15.880 you should contact us if you're somebody
02:06:18.480 who has um uh a knowledge of something
02:06:23.079 that that could could help us prosecute
02:06:25.199 you need to come
02:06:26.559 forward because a lot of the stories
02:06:28.520 that we told the statute of limitations
02:06:30.960 on these abuses have already passed and
02:06:33.599 it's their words against you know a
02:06:35.679 hundred others like let's say uh we
02:06:38.159 walked in right now to that base that I
02:06:40.599 was telling you about most of them

02:06:58.639 the FBI and say hey you all who want to
02:07:01.679 come with me come with me now and we're
02:07:03.199 going to take care of you um and I've

02:07:54.920 not about smacking it's about but he had
02:07:57.119 to do that right he had to beat people
02:07:59.000 David mavage under this is what they
02:08:01.280 they have said and they said it under
02:08:03.599 oath um David miscavage under his
02:08:06.880 Direction has um and they and they have
02:08:09.840 admitted to that um but where they
02:08:12.320 admitted it uh there'd be 20 people who
02:08:15.239 said they're lying now is this like a
02:08:17.400 punishment thing like are they flogging
02:08:18.960 these people it's like a they had a
02:08:20.800 policy called overboarding when the ship
02:08:23.199 was um where the seaorg lived and they
02:08:26.480 would overboard somebody who was out of
02:08:28.199 line so throw them overboard correct and
02:08:30.079 so now so you toss them in the water
02:08:31.920 right and so now you don't have
02:08:33.559 overboarding because you don't have ship
02:08:35.520 right but when you say toss them in the
02:08:37.320 water they pull him back out or you
02:08:40.079 sure line I'm sure they threw him a line
02:08:42.440 I'm sure you know yes they got back on
02:08:44.800 the boat but it was a form of punishment
02:08:46.440 it's called overboarding yeah yeah um
02:08:49.079 now they've just assimilated that to be
02:08:50.920 like we don't have have a boat so we
02:08:52.079 might as well crack him in the mouth or
02:08:53.440 break his finger they don't have a boat
02:08:54.760 anymore no well they have the free winds
02:08:56.840 but they don't have a seaorg ship like
02:08:59.079 they used to now they have bases you
02:09:01.480 know like celebrity center I don't know
02:09:03.679 celebrity center they have the seems
02:09:05.400 like a big factor like what what
02:09:07.400 happened to the boat why you obsessed
02:09:09.320 with the boat cuz I feel like that would
02:09:10.840 be a cool thing to own own the old
02:09:12.639 Scientology boat go parties no this is
02:09:15.920 this is where they told the people about
02:09:17.040 ot6 right in here okay remember what I
02:09:20.360 said that there was the Apollo okay Joe
02:09:23.400 do we need to there was a boat that's
02:09:26.320 what started the seaword that was called
02:09:28.639 the Apollo yeah where they give ot8 is
02:09:32.360 called the free ons they still have that
02:09:34.639 that's a different boat yes okay that
02:09:36.679 boat's still around that boat's still
02:09:38.280 around where's that boat so you can buy
02:09:39.800 that boat probably in the Bahamas oh
02:09:41.920 that's where they go it's a good place
02:09:43.199 to party and learn about the they're not
02:09:45.239 part faton faton and it's not partying
02:09:48.599 oh okay yeah no partying at all no party
02:09:51.159 when do have a party like if they have a
02:09:52.920 big old celebration like I saw the one
02:09:55.159 celebration you I would go to the Gayla
02:09:57.320 every every year Gaya yeah the celebrity
02:10:00.400 center and what what happens there uh we
02:10:03.000 listen to speeches about how much
02:10:04.679 Scientology is accepted in the community
02:10:06.480 by the LAPD and LAPD talks uhhuh LAPD so
02:10:11.159 they contribute a bunch of money to the
02:10:12.840 LD yes they give they give um they
02:10:15.480 started a thing called the police
02:10:16.800 activities fund oh League sorry the
02:10:19.320 police and I and I contributed to it and
02:10:21.040 I help helped it and I they put on a
02:10:22.840 show for the kids every Christmas at
02:10:25.320 Celebrity Center and they give the money
02:10:27.440 the proceeds to what they created which
02:10:30.480 is called the police activities league
02:10:33.159 and they present the the LAPD with money
02:10:36.400 for children well that sounds great it's
02:10:38.280 great but it's but it's but listen it's
02:10:40.800 purposeful it's there's a policy called
02:10:43.079 safe pointing uh the community and
02:10:45.400 that's what they're doing and I did it
02:10:47.119 so I I know what it's about right you
02:10:49.480 appear as if you
02:10:51.840 intentions are pure so that you then
02:10:54.480 have maybe favors like this happening
02:10:56.679 where somebody files a police report and
02:10:59.360 you get screwed with
02:11:02.559 God where do you think this is going
02:11:05.280 like where do you where do you
02:11:06.760 anticipate your battle with this I don't
02:11:09.440 have a battle I hope that but you kind
02:11:12.239 of do um no because I I Joe if you
02:11:16.920 receive the calls that I receive like
02:11:20.199 when when I'm not working on the show
02:11:22.360 cuz you know I'm the executive producer
02:11:23.840 of the show
02:11:25.040 so they're not safe to just call anybody
02:11:27.920 they're not going to call A&E it's Mike
02:11:29.800 me and Mike it's we're the ones who who
02:11:33.440 have to vet these stories and kind of uh
02:11:35.639 people trust us because they know we're
02:11:37.320 telling the truth and they know that we
02:11:39.239 have their best interest at heart in
02:11:41.599 telling the story correctly right um and
02:11:45.719 and when you talk to these people when I
02:11:47.920 talk to them behind the scenes it's it's
02:11:50.199 takes every piece of me not to break
02:11:52.079 down I have to be kind of uh their
02:11:55.639 auditor you know what I mean their
02:11:56.840 Scientology auditor to keep my
02:11:58.840 together but when I hang up I'm
02:12:00.960 devastated by it I'm devastated by it
02:12:03.040 like uh I've been part of this thing you
02:12:04.800 know what I mean like I'm getting CU
02:12:06.679 talking about it now how many people are
02:12:07.880 in it maybe 10,000 worldwide that's it
02:12:11.840 well it gives the appearance because I
02:12:15.920 thought like at these big events at The
02:12:19.119 Shrine Auditorium that they have every
02:12:20.520 year right show what Scientology is
02:12:23.360 doing and they use things like hundreds
02:12:25.159 of millions and these really kind of
02:12:27.360 electrifying statistics right and we
02:12:30.520 bought this building and we bought that
02:12:32.360 building and that would indicate growth
02:12:35.079 right right that's the subliminal
02:12:36.559 message to you you know there's people
02:12:38.840 in there but there are just
02:12:40.800 buildings and but you believe that those
02:12:43.079 buildings are being so they just bought
02:12:44.360 some buildings well they have to for tax
02:12:46.400 purposes right and the appearance that
02:12:48.679 it's growing wow but it's but they have
02:12:51.239 have to get offload some of this money
02:12:53.760 do you have an end game with all this my
02:12:55.760 end game is just to tell these people's
02:12:58.480 stories to validate that their pain is
02:13:01.800 real I'm not going to let the church
02:13:03.440 bully them or Scientology bully them
02:13:06.040 into believing that they made it up that
02:13:08.440 they're out to get money or ft you don't
02:13:10.840 make money doing the show right you know
02:13:12.840 I'm not saying and how long are you
02:13:14.960 doing it for like how how many I don't
02:13:16.760 know I don't know I really how many
02:13:18.840 episodes Have You Done we've only done
02:13:20.400 eight and then two specials you know
02:13:22.719 like some you know the Reddit specials
02:13:24.599 that we've done but you know there's a
02:13:27.760 whole
02:13:29.440 other there's a lot of stories to be
02:13:31.639 told I didn't even scratch the surface
02:13:34.239 so how many stories are we going to tell
02:13:36.239 I don't know what's my endgame my
02:13:38.159 endgame is that these stories get out
02:13:39.840 there that people get in sense enough
02:13:42.079 where this church well I have to calling
02:13:44.400 a church this organization is is held
02:13:46.679 responsible for the things that they
02:13:48.280 have done and um they sto destroying
02:13:52.199 families I mean there's so many tears to
02:13:55.079 it that I don't I don't know where it
02:13:56.559 ends I don't know where it ends but
02:13:58.119 somebody there's no plan as far as I
02:14:00.360 don't have a plan other than you're
02:14:01.760 going to stop hurting people that's it
02:14:04.599 you're going to you're going to take
02:14:05.599 some responsibility for what you've done
02:14:08.199 these stories are real these are not
02:14:10.159 Liars people don't say they were hurt
02:14:12.480 and molested they don't go on television
02:14:14.920 for fame to they don't get money from
02:14:17.400 doing that they don't get money from
02:14:19.239 doing that who wants to go on television
02:14:21.119 and say I was coerced into getting an
02:14:23.639 abortion and and who who who does that
02:14:26.280 for fame really Joe I was hit I was
02:14:29.719 abused I was sexually molested I allowed
02:14:32.000 this to happen these things are not easy
02:14:34.199 for people to admit to right you know
02:14:37.119 you think it's easy for me to say I was
02:14:38.840 you know I believed in this my whole
02:14:40.599 life that my mother believed in it her
02:14:42.840 whole life that my step like we gave our
02:14:45.360 life to this thing well you're very
02:14:47.440 fortunate your mother made it out too so
02:14:49.559 fortunate God I've been here a long time
02:14:51.119 time I should go yeah and I'm sweating
02:14:52.760 now that's okay we we'll wrap this up
02:14:54.440 but you know how I feel about sweat like

02:14:57.920 that I'm swea you don't like sweat well

02:15:10.679 but no I think I think you're very brave

02:15:13.719 in it's like what you're doing with your
02:15:17.040 show but the way you're admitting your
02:15:19.760 own personal

02:15:23.559 having with your own mind trying to sort
